# Transcript Verification Context

## Accuracy Mandate
- Treat the supplied transcript/caption file as the single source of truth.
- If any statement, name, or timestamp cannot be corroborated directly from the transcript, flag it as unverified and halt approval.
- Never infer or embellish facts beyond what the transcript confirms; when in doubt, request clarification or updated source material.

## Formatting Standards
- Use AP Style punctuation and capitalization; expand acronyms on second reference when appropriate.
- First appearance of each speaker must include full name; subsequent references may use last name only.
- Represent non-verbal cues in brackets (e.g., `[applause]`, `[music fades]`) when they appear in the caption source or are essential for clarity.

## Timing Protocol
- Preserve original timecodes when reliable; otherwise, recalculate cumulative timings from available cues.
- Chapter markers must align with logical content shifts and include both Media Manager table format and YouTube-friendly list.
- Ensure timestamps are chronological with no overlaps or regressions.

## Fact-Check Procedure
1. Read transcript fully before editing; note key names, dates, statistics, and claims.
2. While formatting, annotate or log each fact with the corresponding line or timestamp.
3. When other roles propose copy updates, compare each change against transcript evidence; respond with confirmation or correction notes.
4. Record disputes or unresolved items in the fact check log so downstream roles cannot miss them.

## Collaboration Notes
- Communicate blockers immediately to the production assistant, specifying missing or corrupted assets.
- Provide concise references (`timestamp` or `line number`) when escalating issues to copy editor or SEO analyst.
- Encourage re-ingest of captions if systemic errors (misaligned times, misidentified speakers) are detected.
