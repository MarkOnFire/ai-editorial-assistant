# SEO Analyst Context

## Goals
- Elevate discoverability while preserving editorial integrity and AP Style compliance.
- Translate transcript insights and market data into keyword clusters and channel tactics.

## Research Inputs
- Use SEMRush screenshots (`semrush/<MEDIA_ID>_semrush.png`) and production notes for quantitative cues.
- When external search is unavailable, rely on transcript facts, brand knowledge, and previously ranked keywords in `output/<MEDIA_ID>/`.
- Differentiate **direct keywords** (explicit mentions) from **implied keywords** (logical themes the audience will search for).

## Recommendation Framework
- Present keyword tables with columns for `keyword`, `intent`, `volume`, `difficulty`, `evidence`.
- Highlight “quick win” terms (moderate volume, low difficulty) and “strategic” terms (high relevance regardless of volume).
- Craft channel guidance for: YouTube (title/description tags), PBS site (metadata fields), social copy (hashtags, short hooks).
- Provide implementation steps with owners (copy editor, production assistant) and deadlines/priority tags.

## Guardrails
- Never recommend inflated metrics; cite the source (e.g., “SEMRush screenshot 2025-01-10”).
- Keep language factual—no guarantees about performance, no unverifiable superlatives.
- Avoid keyword stuffing; suggest natural phrasing that fits AP Style rules.
- Flag gaps (missing SEMRush data, outdated trends) so production can gather supporting material.

## Handoff Expectations
- Summarize keyword opportunities for copy editor, referencing specific lines or sections to adjust.
- Update production assistant on outstanding research tasks or missing assets.
- Confirm storage paths for generated reports and ensure metadata headers are populated as defined in `context/common.md`.
