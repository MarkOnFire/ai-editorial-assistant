1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,105
- It's always story time at
Bookworm Gardens in Sheboygan

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,208
as we turn the page to uncover
a spellbinding world

3
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,844
of children's literature.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,480
- Child: Over here!

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,416
- Angela: Our story begins
with Elizabeth Wieland,

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:20,687
Executive Director of the
nonprofit botanical garden.

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,855
- Elizabeth Wieland:
Bookworm's mission

8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,725
is to inspire the love of books
and nature

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,760
in the young and young at heart.

10
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,395
When you think about our mission

11
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,697
and you think about young
and young at heart,

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,868
I really believe that we have
an incredible experience

13
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,971
and inspiration for people
of all ages here on this site.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,408
I love it when there are
families here and children here.

15
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,278
I also love it when there are
adults without children

16
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,280
and older individuals.

17
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,749
That's really important to us
that we have both.

18
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,250
- Parent: There we go!

19
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,652
- Elizabeth: In many
of our exhibits,

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,986
they play with scale,

21
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,924
so you get to feel like you are
either incredibly small

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,426
or incredibly large.
[child exclaiming]

23
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,828
- Can you tell us more about the
spaces in the gardens?

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,897
- Gosh, there are so many
spaces.

25
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,465
So in each site,

26
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:09,203
we've taken the book and then
interpreted it in some way.

27
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,804
Some of 'em, you're meant
to interact with.

28
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,173
You could stick your head
through this donut here

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,775
in Cloudy with a Chance
of Meatballs.

30
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,711
Some of it, you're just meant
to observe and ponder

31
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,379
and think about.

32
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,981
- So I love the attention
to detail.

33
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,383
Can we go check out some more?
- I would love to!

34
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,118
Let's go explore.

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,288
- Angela: We're off to discover
the hidden details

36
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,292
found within the Cloudy with a
Chance of Meatballs garden.

37
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,561
- So I grabbed the book.
- Oh, okay.

38
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,264
- To show you, because there's
some really special elements

39
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,367
in the book that are
in the space.

40
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,003
One of them, we looked at the
bread house before,

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,640
and here in the book
is the bread house.

42
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,410
[playful music]
[child exclaiming]

43
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,448
So in front of us, these are
berry timeless coral bells.

44
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,850
These are caramel coral bells.

45
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,018
- Angela:
The food-inspired names?

46
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,253
- Elizabeth:
The food-inspired names!

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,454
That one's a cinnamon fern.

48
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,756
This is the guacamole heuchera.

49
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,560
So we really love to add those
details in the garden spaces.

50
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,563
- Thank you, that's interesting.

51
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,698
Each garden is a new book.

52
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,301
- Elizabeth: So the books exist
in these pillars.

53
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,270
They're all laminated
and protected in here

54
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,040
so that you can open the door,
pull out the book,

55
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,076
and then experience the space
right there at your fingertips.

56
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,078
- Angela: I love that.

57
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,949
With every book,
a literary world comes to life.

58
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,151
- Elizabeth: So we're in the
area of the gardens now

59
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,319
that's called the farm.

60
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,321
And there are quite a few books
in this section.

61
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,123
One of our very most popular
is this book,

62
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,357
<i>Little Blue Truck.</i>

63
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,359
And you can crawl into the truck
and drive it

64
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,763
and go beep beep beep,
just like the little blue truck.

65
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,965
And we have live chickens.
- Angela: I was gonna say,

66
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,700
I see the live chickens!
- Yep.

67
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,303
And then this is the
Johnny Appleseed tree.

68
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,772
It's pretty cool because it's
genetically connected.

69
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,208
We have the paperwork
to show its lineage

70
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,976
back to an original
Johnny Appleseed tree

71
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,277
that was planted here.

72
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,247
But there's lots of gardens here
in the farm.

73
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,317
It's one of our most
popular spaces.

74
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,651
- Thank you so much.

75
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,453
I appreciate your tour
and your time today, Elizabeth.

76
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,055
- It's been so much fun
having you.

77
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,257
Thanks so much, and please
come back and visit us again.

78
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,125
- Definitely will.

79
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,294
