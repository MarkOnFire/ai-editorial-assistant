And welcome to
<i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

26
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,924
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

27
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,093
We're on a mission
to discover a place

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,962
where science and art collide

29
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,264
by joining
the Blackbird Creative Lab

30
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,100
as they take over
Yerkes Observatory.

31
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,768
The observatory
in Williams Bay

32
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,638
continues to play
an important role in astronomy,

33
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,007
but for two weeks,
it transforms

34
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,843
into a constellation
of musical creativity.

35

Grammy Award-winning ensemble
"Eighth Blackbird"

37
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,920
welcomes a cohort of
musical ensembles and composers

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,657
for an immersive
creative experience.

39
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,427
During their time here,
musicians receive mentorship,

40
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,264
collaborate, and experiment,

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,100
all while composing
new musical arrangements

42
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,271
inspired and created
for this historic space.

43
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,939
Before we get back
to the music,

44
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,542
let's narrow our lens
and learn more about

45
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:27,714
the largest refracting telescope
in the world, found right here.

46
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,518
And focus in on the deputy
director at Yerkes Observatory,

47
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:37,057
working to revitalize this space
through science and art.

- Dr. Amanda Bauer:
? I wanna go to space,
I wanna break free ?

Amanda: You ready?

50
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,536
- Angela: With a song in
her heart and stars in her eyes,

51
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:54,942
Dr. Amanda Bauer is ready
to show off Yerkes Observatory.

52
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,144
- Amanda: It's known for

53
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:01,615
having the world's
largest refracting telescope.

54
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,283
There we go.

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,855
1897 is when it first opened
its eye on the skies.

56
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,692
The dome moves around
360 degrees to allow for

57
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,628
the telescope to be able
to point in any direction.

58
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,363
[bright music]

59
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,803
It really innovated the way
that astronomy was done.

60
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,839
It was the last
big refractor built

61
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,307
because, when you see it,

62
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:32,079
you see how mechanically amazing
and huge-scale it is.

63

[bright music]

64
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:43,390
- Angela: The entire
observatory floor,
at 90 feet wide,

65
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:48,495
serves as a giant elevator,
the largest in Wisconsin,

66
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,734
lifting astronomers up
to the great refractor telescope

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,802
and into the heavens.

68
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,905
[dramatic music]

69
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,442
- Amanda: There's a magic to it
in using it.

70
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,211
It's so hands-on.

71
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,748
That just takes you
to a different space.

[upbeat music]

74
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,293
- Angela:
As the new deputy director,

75
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,929
one of Amanda's first jobs:

76
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:26,466
to make sure
the telescopes still function.

77
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,435
- They hadn't been used
in five years,

78
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,838
and I hadn't used a refracting
telescope in a while,

79
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,040
so just kind of
getting my hands in there

80
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,441
and seeing if it worked.

81
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,176
Okay, looks good.

82
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,245
You know when you wake up,

83
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,947
and you're like, [imitates
stretching], and you creak?

84
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,582
That's what the telescope
was doing.

[telescope creaking]

86
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,754
It was pretty spectacular.

87
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,224
It was like
understanding the magic

88
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,759
that people have been seeing
for generations.

who has been the head of science
here, in this observatory.

with further research.

97

00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,361
- Angela: Amanda joins a long
list of famous astronomers

100
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,098
who peered into the galaxy
with this exact telescope.

- Amanda: Edwin Hubble
is absolutely

103
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,471
one of the most famous names
that people have heard.

104
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:41,208
The next big telescope
that NASA is going to launch

105
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,677
is named
the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope,

106
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,279
because she went
from Yerkes

107
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,682
to become the very first
chief of astronomy at NASA.

108
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:53,520
Carl Sagan was one
of my first idol astronomers.

109
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,723
This observatory
is so historic,

110
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,894
so many people
have come through here.

[lively music]

112
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,167
- Angela: One legacy those
astronomers left behind

113
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,670
is a massive
collection of images

114
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,406
from our galaxy
and beyond.

115

[gears rasping]

116
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,809
- Amanda: We have
180,000 glass plates

117
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,278
that capture these images
of the cosmos

118
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,514
over the last 125 years,

119
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,016
and that's useful
in research today.

120
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,120
The glass plates
that are here are spectacular.

121
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,589
This is Comet Morehouse.

122
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,426
It was discovered by
a student who was here in 1908.

123
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,794
What we're doing is

124
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,963
reinvigorating
that research program,

125
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,933
bringing it back after kind
of a dormant couple of decades,

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,536
because it does have
opportunities

127
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,837
to use these telescopes

128
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,106

of students.

00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,146
a historic discovery.

132
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,582
- The shape of the Milky Way
galaxy is spiral arms,

133
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,317
and they determined that
here.

[bright classical music]

135
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,757
- Angela: Despite
the scientific history here,

136
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,393
its future
was up in the air.

137
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:13,333
Over the years, the observatory
had fallen into disrepair.

138

- Amanda: No one knew what was
gonna happen to this building,

139
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,338
and the glass plate collection,
and the telescopes.

140
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,275
How can we resurrect
and reimagine

00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,510
what this observatory can do?

142

- Angela: In 2020,
the Yerkes Future Foundation

143
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,951
bought the observatory
from the University of Chicago.

[bright jazz music]

145
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,756
- Amanda: The modern-day purpose
of this observatory

146
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,960
is really bringing
research, art, culture,

147
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:46,366
a cross-disciplinary approach
to big ideas.

148
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,470
So, tying that art and science
together

149
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,139
in every facet
of what we do

150
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,141
is pretty fun,
it's pretty unique.
[giggling]

151
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,578
You can come here
and get a sense of the magnitude

152
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,879
of what was undertaken

153
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,914
and the types of discoveries
that were made

154
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,916
over the last 125 years.

155
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,384
You get to see

156
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,119
the biggest refracting telescope
in the world,

157

you get to hear
these stories come alive

158
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,092
about what has happened
in this building.

that the reason
why I'm doing drag

226

is to help educate
our communities.

When we're in drag,

by his mother,

Brandon took her name
as part of his drag persona.

- Angela: That tribute brought
Brandon closer to his mom,

that taught him something else.

is on her,

and she gets to buy
all the flashy costuming.

And she gets to do

Brandon's a little bit
more professional in life,

00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,203
but Bianca's taught Brandon
to do that

288
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,938
because Bianca
makes some money,

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,009
We wanted
to create a space

316
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,446
that serves that demographic
of emerging professionals.

317
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,114
- Angela: Wow,
that's quite a journey,

318
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,383
from you all as musicians
now creating a space

319
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,418
for other artists
to engage with.

320
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,320
- Lisa:
It's a very intense program,

321
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,256
and it's designed
to be that way.

322
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,292
We really wanted
to develop the curriculum

323
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,362
to what
the cohort's needs were.

324
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,565
- And they're not asking about,
"How do I compose music

325
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,500
or how do I
play my instrument?"

326
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,769
They're saying,
"How do I manage my finances?

327
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,337
How do I read a contract?"

328
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,107
And this program
is very intentionally

329
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:44,244
geared toward the whole human
of the emerging artist,

330
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,446
not just performance.

331
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,815
And even this place,
the Yerkes Observatory,

332
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,217
is a teaching vehicle.

333
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:54,021
This is an extraordinarily
unique concert hall.

334
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,023
- Lisa: I mean, it's not
even a concert hall.

335
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,191
[Lisa and Angela laughing]

336
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,592
- Exactly.
- And so, managing sound

337
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,427
in an observatory
is quite different.

338
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,063
- But I think too
that our partnership with Yerkes

339
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,665
has been so beautiful.

340
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,402
We are not creating work
that's in the science field,

341
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,404
which is what
Yerkes is known for,

342
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,472
but we hope that
we're bringing in folks

343
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,943
who are incredibly innovative
in art.

344

[bright music]

345
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,479
- Angela: Folks like
composer Julia Moss

346
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,014
and the group "Sputter Box"

347
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,884
are cohorts
of this year's program.

348
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:27,287
- Julia Moss:
So I'm writing a piece
called "Growing Pains."

349
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,523
It's about
the mourning process

350
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,393
of sort of growing
and splitting off from

351
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,663
old parts of yourself

352
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:41,034
and how that can be
nostalgic and scary and hard

353
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,538
but also a positive
thing for moving forward.

354
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,306
- That is interesting
and relatable. [laughs]

355
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,641
- Yes. [laughs]

356
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,877
- So, what is it like creating
in this specific space?

357
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:53,280
- We've really had an open
and vulnerable process here.

358
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,650
I really think that
this piece couldn't have been

359
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,919
what it was
if it wasn't in this space,

360
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:01,822
together and also
at the Yerkes Observatory

361
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,892
it's so resonant and beautiful.

362
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,094
- Angela: From composition--

363
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,029
- How about we
start from letter J--

364
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:12,366
- Angela: To practice...
[playing mallets]

...to performance.

[Mason sings in Hmong]

377
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,334
- Mason Lospeej Her:
I would say being connected
to your identity

378
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,772
gives you purpose, value,
and a reason why,

379
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,009
especially when
I was in college.

380
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,478
I'm in my last year
of my master's program

381
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,714
studying clinical
rehabilitation counseling.

382
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,016
As a young Hmong American male,

383
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,218
I've used
this instrument

384
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,887
to help me navigate
my experiences,

385
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,356
as well as
preserve our culture.

386
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,192
The only thing that
I could use as an outlet

387
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,729
to explore my identity
or remind me of my identity

388
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,798
was my instrument, the qeej.

389
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,533
[playing qeej]

390
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,473
- My name is Mason Lospeej Her,

391
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,743
and I play the traditional
Hmong instrument, qeej.

392
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,478
[playing qeej]

393
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:35,916
The qeej is
a woodwind instrument

394
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,986
that is made
out of bamboo, wood,

395
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,022
tree bark,
and alloy reeds.

396
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,358
[playing qeej]

397
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:51,431
The instrument is typically
played at weddings, funerals,

398
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,201
and at Hmong New Year's
for entertainment purposes.

399

[playing qeej]

400
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,540
So, when we play
the instrument,

401
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,376
it does mimic
the Hmong language.

402
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:06,313
[playing qeej,
ringing cymbals on shirt]

403
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,050
It can basically
share our Hmong story.

404
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,019
[gentle music]

405
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:15,289
From our culture
back then,

406
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,258
as a displaced group
of people,

407
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,961
we didn't have
a written language.

408
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:25,732
We weren't able to communicate
or write down our history.

409
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,368
It was a lot
of oral history.

410
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:34,408
So, one of the ways that
we've been able to preserve that

411
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,610
is through qeej song.

412
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,847
So, I've been able
to preserve those stories

413
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,149
and also
pass them down.

414
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,084
[playing qeej]

415
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,121
So, I was introduced
to the instrument

416
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,290
when I was
eight years old.

417
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,792
Initially,
it was my mother

418
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,961
who wanted me
to learn an instrument.

419
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:58,198
Then, my father
wanted to come in and teach us.

420
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,701
There are a lot of aspects
to the instrument,

421
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,537
so I am still learning
myself,

422
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,939
but we have
created a relationship

423
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,108
to now create stories
together,

424
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,111
and share our stories
as a father and son,

425
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,514
as well as
a student and a teacher.

426
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,249
[playing qeej]

427
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,923
My favorite part about
playing an instrument would be

428
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,693
the therapeutic effects
that I get from the instrument.

429
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,529
So, when I play
the instrument,

430
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,265
I do have to focus
on breathing,

431
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,500
in a sense
of mindfulness breathing,

432
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,271
as well as, again,
being able to tell my story

433
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:41,141
as a first-generation
college student.

434
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,779
When I felt that I was alone,
away from family,

435
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:48,849
I could play the instrument
and feel that I belonged

436
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,985
or it was something
that I was good at.

437
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,555
I've definitely created
a different relationship

438
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,956
with the instrument,

439
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:58,058
rather than just using it
for cultural purposes.

440

[playing qeej]

441
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,400
The qeej is important
because it is

442
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,136
something unique
to the Hmong people.

443

[playing qeej,

You get to understand
what your history is

445
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:21,615
and why you are pursuing
to be the person you want to be.

446
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,986
It speaks to the importance
of how music

447
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,823
and this instrument
can share stories,

448
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,693
as well as help generations
heal together

449
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,394
and communicate together.

we would have no decay.

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,493
probably from
the very beginning.

472
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,961
Both of us have
Polish backgrounds,

473
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,765
and there's a lot of interest
in foraging.

474
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,634
Fungi is a big thing
in that population.

475
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,670
- Joe Krawczyk: As a kid,
I hated mushrooms.

476
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:54,641
My grandfather taught my dad
what mushrooms to pick.

477
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,744
- I think that I learned a lot
in my very early years

478
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:02,149
about foraging and food
preparation through the family.

479
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,585
Joe and I met
in a mycology class.

480
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,788
We both were students
in the UW System.

481
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:11,024
He was mostly interested in
the effects of fungi and plants,

482
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:14,895
and I was mostly interested in
eating fungi.

483
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:17,364
- Joseph: And also, just eat
right out of the pan.

484
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:19,299
- That's pretty much
as far as they go.

485
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,201
- Yeah.
[both laughing]

486
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,536
- Joe: I was working for

487
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,171
the Department of Natural
Resources in Madison.

488
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,373
The paper came across my desk

489
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,710
on shiitake cultivation
on natural logs,

490
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,713
a potential new industry
for the US.

491
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,716
I said, "Mary Ellen,
we have access to the wood

492
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,150
"and the resources.

493
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,052
Why don't we look into this?"

494
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,924
- Mary Ellen:
So, we decided that
we wanted to pursue the idea

495
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,559
of having a small business.

496
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,195
We moved ourselves
up to Peshtigo, Wisconsin,

497
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:49,730
where we are now.

498
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:53,000
We established our business
on the family farm.

499
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,835
- Joe: 42-some years later,

500
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:57,104
still doing
what we set out to do

501
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,140
back in the '80s,
and we love it even more now

502
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,341
than we did then.

503
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:03,076
[bright music]

504
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:07,181
- Mary Ellen: Yeah, in 2017,
we discovered that the farm

505
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:11,385
just could not host the growth
that we were experiencing.

506
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,454
- Joe: It was a big challenge
because we scaled up.

507
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,190
[bright music]

508
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:21,862
What we do here
is we maintain a culture bank

509
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:25,499
of different fungi
that we're currently producing.

510
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:29,236
The process starts
in our general lab,

511
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:32,372
where we take a parent culture
and expand it

512
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,141
into another media,

513
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:37,044
to increase the amount
of mycelium we're producing.

514
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,512
[machine beeping]

515
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,748
While that's growing,
we take the raw materials

516
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:46,486
which are needed
for growing a specific culture.

517
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:49,122
- Mary Ellen: Most of the fungi
that we grow here

518
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:50,457
are wood decay fungi,

519
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:54,261
so they're growing on
recently dead material.

520
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,529
- Joe: Once things
are sterilized,

521
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,097
they go
into our clean room,

522
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:01,335
where we have technicians open
the bags up, inoculate them,

523
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:04,171
seal 'em, and then they
go into incubation.

524
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:07,841
- Employee: This cart is
good to go, fully colonized,

525
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:11,778
and ready to be moved out
to the shipping area.

526
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:16,316
- Joe: Given time, we reach
that perfect stage of rot,

527
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,519
which will then
be used by the grower

528
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:21,755
to expand
into their substrate.

529
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:25,125
- Mary Ellen:
So, for us to understand decay
and not be afraid of it,

530
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,561
and to be able to use it
in a certain way

531
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:31,231
to grow a food crop,
is a really cool thing for us.

532
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:32,633
- Joe: We're picking
everything today.

533
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,102
- Mary Ellen: Okay, well,
do a good job, Joe.

534
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,638
- Joe: We just love
mushroom cultivation.

535
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,273
[Mary Ellen laughs]

536
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:41,341
It's a passion for us.

537

all the right notes

Blackbird Creative Lab

540
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,082
