1
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,409
Alright, hocus pocus!

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,144
Everybody focus!

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,915
We have cucumbers.

4
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,184
They're packed
with so much flavor.

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,786
Tomatoes. They're tiny,
but they're delicious.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,420
Unit B!

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,155
Seven!

8
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,160
I teach them
how to check the pH,

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,896
check our nutrient levels.

10
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,899
to actually make qualitative
observations.

11
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,634
Nutrients!

12
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,806
I've never was
a green thumb
person before.

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,743
I actually never
even owned a plant before

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,579
or even felt confident enough
to grow any plants.

15
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:46,880
This is beautiful.

16
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:51,018
I get excited and emotional
because I never thought...

17
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,221
that I was going to be able
to do something like this.

18
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,956
Yeah!
