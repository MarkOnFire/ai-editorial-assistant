00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:00,999
[shimmery music]

2
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:04,458
I'm at Pringle Nature Center
in Bristol Woods County Park,

3
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:07,000
immersing myself
in the programs offered here

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
while learning about
the great outdoors.

5
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,583
With hands-on activities,

6
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,999
nature-based events,

7
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,999
and accessible
wheelchair availability,

8
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:21,542
this nature center
has something for everyone.

9
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,333
- Elizabeth Alvey:
We have year-round programming
at the nature center.

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,125
We do a lot of different

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,500
educational and recreational
activities and events.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,125
We have everything
from field trips

13
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,917
to homeschool programs,
all different nature topics.

14
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:37,250
- So, I understand that here
you have a combination

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,875
of kind of more
educational programming,

16
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,917
but also fun things
for families and youth to do.

17
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,125
So, on the educational side,

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,999
what is one
of your standout programs?

19
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,750
- I think one
of our standout programs

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,417
is our
Homeschool Science program.

21
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:52,000
We do a different nature topic
every meeting.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,542
One of them that is, I guess,
one of our favorites

23
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,333
is the maple syrup hike.

24
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,625
We go out to
Petrifying Springs Park,

25
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,125
and we take the families

26
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,500
up into the sugar bush
in that park

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,125
and look at
the sugar maple trees.

28
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,750
And we talk about everything
from how the trees make the sap,

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,417
how we get the sap,
and make the maple syrup.

30
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,875
And then,
they can do taste tests

31
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,250
for some of our maple syrup
that we make on site.

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,999
- Angela:
As a former homeschool kid,
I appreciate that.

33
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:21,625
- Is it good?
- Child: Yeah.

34
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,750
- That sounds
like a combination

35
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,999
of both education and fun,
honestly, to me.

36
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,208
- I think
all of our programs are fun,

37
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,125
but, yeah,
it is very educational, too.

38
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,125
- I understand that we're going
to be participating in Mud Day.

39
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,542
So, can you
tell me about that?

40
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,583
- Sure, that is more
on the fun side

41
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,375
and less on the
educational side.

42
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,375
Families bring
their kids out,

43
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,125
and we have some mud pits
set up outside.

44
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,542
- Wow!
- And it is what it sounds like.

45
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,333
Kids jump in the mud.
[Angela laughs]

46
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,333
Some of them
get head-to-toe covered

47
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,500
and become one
with nature.

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,166
And other kids might
like to play lawn games

49
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,917
or blow bubbles instead.

50
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,999
But it's just a lot of fun
seeing all the kids just doing

51
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:04,875
what they're not supposed to do
most of the year.

52
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,999
- So, literally, just a chance

53
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,709
for kids to engage
in nature,

54
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,250
doing the messy things
that they like doing anyway?

55
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:10,999
- Yes, exactly.

56
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:13,667
What are some of the feedback
you're hearing
from kids and families

57
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,750
who are able to take part
in your activities?

58
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,917
- We hear a lot of feedback
that families just love

59
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,583
being in the park,
exploring the different
habitats,

60
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,125
visit the forest,
the prairie, the pond.

61
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,375
We love getting to see them

62
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,917
making new discoveries
and meeting animals,

63
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,250
seeing things
they haven't seen before.

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,500
New discoveries
to explore

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,333
here at
the Pringle Nature Center.
