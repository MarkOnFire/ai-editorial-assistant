1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,437
It's always storytime at
Bookworm Gardens in Sheboygan.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,340
As we turn the page
to uncover a spellbinding world

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,976
of children's literature.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,349
Our story begins with Elizabeth
Wieland, Executive

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,886
Director of the nonprofit
botanical garden.

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,722
Bookworm's mission
is to inspire the love of books

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,892
and nature in the young
and young at heart.

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,661
When you think about our mission
and you think about young

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,498
and young at heart,
I really believe that we have,

10
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,734
an incredible experience
and inspiration

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,069
for people of all ages
here on this site.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,506
I love it when there are
families here and children here.

13
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,742
I also love it
when there are adults

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,811
without children
and older individuals.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,582
That's really important to us
that we have both.

16
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,684
In many of our exhibits
they play with scale.

17
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,655
So you get to feel like
you are either incredibly

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,291
small or incredibly large.

19
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,093
Can you tell us more
about the spaces in the gardens?

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,962
Gosh, there are so many spaces.

21
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,731
So in each site,
we've taken the book

22
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,401
and then interpreted it
in some way.

23
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,902
Some of them you're
meant to interact with.

24
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,637
You could stick your head
through this

25
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,639
donut here in Cloudy
with a Chance of Meatballs.

26
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,941
Some of it

27
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:19,246
you're just meant to observe
and ponder and think about.
