we were going to use it

305

50 different species of plants.

To me, the most important part
about the gardens

311
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,999
is that people realize

312

that birds, bees, butterflies,
and bats-- but mostly bees--

working on a steamboat.

476
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,208
[blowing off steam]

477
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,999
I like to joke that the<i>Julia
 Belle Swain</i>was my first love.

478
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:03,458
[steam whistle]

479
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,792
- But not even love
could save the<i>Julia Belle.</i>

480
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:11,166
- Definitely, it hurt
a lot of people.

481
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:15,333
- In 2008, her paddlewheel
churned upriver

482
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,208
for the very last time.

483
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,625
- Ellis: It's hard to believe
how many people it's touched.

484
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,291
And that's exactly why
everybody was so disappointed

485
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,125
and why they were
so sad and hurt

486
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,333
by the fact
that the<i>Julia Belle</i>

487
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,333
shuttered
and was laid up.

488
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,875
- It remained dormant

489
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,542
until the<i>Julia Belle Swain
</i> Foundation

490
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,000
set out
to restore and preserve

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,375
this piece
of La Crosse history.

492
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,417
- Ellis: We're very lucky

493
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,166
that the<i>Julia Belle
</i>still even floats

494
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,041
after the last several years
of neglect.

495
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,667
Anything that's built
to move and built to run

496
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,417
gets destroyed
by just sitting.

497
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,542
- Then, just like
the muddy Mississippi River,

498
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,083
those renovation plans
got muddied,

499
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,250
millions of dollars spent,

500
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,999
and mounting costs
sank the project.

501
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,875
- Ellis: It was a lot
for people to deal with;

502
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,999
it really was.

503
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,291
A foundation dissolving

504
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,709
and not being able
to finish the project.

505
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,625
[calliope music]
The sadness,
the fact that

506
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,999
you'll never get to
experience that again.

507
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,625
- But Old Man River
has a way of never giving up

508
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,000
and always
pushing forward.

509
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,417
- Ellis: The river brings
lots of people together

510
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,792
for lots of reasons.

511
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:23,834
[torch sparking]

512
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:27,834
I had not expected
to come back to Wisconsin

513
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:28,999
and work on the boat.

514
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,208
[circular saw buzzes]

515
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:30,999
- Angela: This time,

516
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,458
new owners would put Ellis
at the helm

517
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,959
of restoration efforts.

518
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,583
- I guess
I have never really felt

519
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,625
any excitement
quite like that...

520
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,959
stepping back
on the boat,

521
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,333
knowing that
we're breathing life

522
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,999
back into this project.

523
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,999
- It is also a chance
to revitalize

524
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:48,999
the historic riverboat
his dad once captained.

525
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:49,792
- I guess coming back,

526
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:52,166
I kind of feel like a kid again.
[chuckles]

527
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,834
I feel like
I'm where I should be.

528
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,375
- Ellis would not only
work on the<i>Julia Belle,</i>

529
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:01,999
but also the<i>Spirit of Peoria
</i> riverboat restoration.

530
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,250
- Ellis: I like to call 'em
stepsisters.

531
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,250
[tool buzzing]

532
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,999
Obviously, from Peoria,
Illinois,

533
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:11,709
the boat replaced the<i>Julia
 Belle Swain</i>back in the '80s.

534
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:12,291
[ratchet clicking]

535
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,542
Every day is exciting;
every day is something new.

536
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,041
- By this point,
the<i>Julia Belle</i>

537
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:20,166
hadn't rolled on the river
in 14 years.

538
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,333
- Just sitting
is bad for a boat.

539
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:27,291
It's killed some of the greatest
boats that we've ever had.

540
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,917
- Despite past attempts
at preservation,

541
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:34,041
years of standing idle
proved unkind to the steamboat.

542
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,999
- Ellis: Once she got here
and we got into the project,

543
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,458
we realized that

544
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,999
there were a lot of changes
that needed to be made.

545
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,999
We dove right in,
torn her apart.

546
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,083
- Torn apart
and put back together

547
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,250
with a few more
bells and whistles.

548
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,333
- Don't want
to pull any punches here.

549
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,208
She won't be
the same as she was.

550
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,709
Once we're finished with her,

551
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,208
she's going
to be very different.

552
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,999
At her core, at her heart,
she'll still be a steamboat.

553
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,208
- The one thing
that won't change:

554
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,917
her 110-year-old steam engines.

555
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,917
- Ellis: They've had more than
a million miles logged on them.

556
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:10,875
I'm looking forward
to the steam engines

557
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,750
[key ring clinking]
jumping back into life.

558
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,875
The sounds, the sights,
the smells, it's all part of it.

559
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,583
It's going to be
a lot of fun.

560
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,999
It'll be
definitely an experience.

561
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,375
- For La Crosse,
it's more bittersweet.

562
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,375
- It was quite emotional.

563
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,291
- In December of 2023,

564
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,750
a barge escorted
the stepsisters downriver

565
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,959
as the city
bid farewell

566
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,999
to the riverboats.

567
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:36,999
- There's only
five Sternwell steamboats left.

568
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:41,041
The bigger picture
is that we're working on this

569
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,375
so that we can inspire

570
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,667
another generation
of steamboaters.

571
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,166
- Their makeover
will continue,

572
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,834
and eventually, both will have
a new riverfront home,

573
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,417
but not in La Crosse.

574
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,417
- When we get to Nashville,

575
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:57,458
we'll be a wedding destination
of the South.

576
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,834
It's already
a huge wedding destination,

577
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,542
but once
this boat's there,

578
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,417
we'll be offering
fully curated weddings.

579
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,542
[calliope]
She'll still be
America's finest example

580
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:10,999
of a Sternwell steamboat,
in my opinion.

581
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,125
- As for Ellis,
he has no intention

582
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,959
of ever leaving
his first love.

583
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,750
I don't know that
I'll ever say goodbye again.

584
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,999
[cheerful calliope]

585
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,542
I'm looking forward
to a long future,

586
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:24,750
either
on the<i>Julia Belle</i>

587
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,333
or at least close enough
that I can hear her whistle.

588
