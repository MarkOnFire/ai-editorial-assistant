[cheerful, folksy music,

00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:09,125
- Angela Fitzgerald:
As Em Loerzel walks by
UW-River Falls' clock tower,

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,999
she's starting
a new time in her life.

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,375
- Em Loerzel:
I'm a newly-minted PhD,

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,208
and I was able to start

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,999
at UW-River Falls
in their social work department,

7
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:20,959
and I feel really lucky.

8
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,625
- For Em, it's a dream job,

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,667
where she can continue
her social justice work,

10
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,999
serving her Native community.

11
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,458
- Em: I'm really, really
passionate

12
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,125
about the wellness
of my community.

13
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,834
Hi, boys!

14
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,125
Good morning!

15
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,375
- But in addition
to a dream job,

16
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:45,291
Em also finds herself fulfilling
a dream for her people.

17
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,917
- It seems like Creator
has a funny sense of humor.

18
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:53,583
I guess... now I do
a lot of stuff with horses.

19
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,999
[chuckles]

20
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:57,458
- Horses that were
once in danger,

21
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,291
she has now given
a home.

22
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:03,542
- Em: This is the first home
that we were ever able to buy.

23
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:06,999
We bought it more for the horses
and less for us.

24
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:10,041
[carefree country guitar]

25
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,083
This is "Grey Cloud."

26
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,000
- Em sees the horses
as family.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,250
- And then this is
"Strawberry<i>Ode'imini Giizis,"</i>

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,208
the Strawberry Moon.

29
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,375
- This is "<i>Misajidamoo."</i>

30
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,709
That means "grey squirrel."

31
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,458
Her Ojibwe name is<i>"Dimi."</i>

32
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,625
- The horses
have Ojibwe names

33
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,000
because they are known
as Ojibwe ponies.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,125
- They're distinct.

35
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,291
They're a very distinct breed.

36
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,083
- Distinct and rare.

37
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:41,917
Fewer than 200
Ojibwe ponies remain.

38
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,999
[horses lips flutter,

[horse clip clops]

40
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:50,709
The chance to work with the rare
breed attracted Leah Witt,

41
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,834
a recent graduate
of UW-River Falls'

42
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,000
Equine Science program.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,792
- Leah Witt:
They're a lot fuzzier
than your average horse.

44
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:00,750
They have these really,
really hairy little ears.

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,999
They also have
this enormous, thick mane,

46
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,083
and what that actually does

47
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,166
is it keeps their veins
and their arteries

48
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,709
warm in the wintertime

49
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:12,375
and cool in the summertime.

50
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,750
- Angela: Those features
made the ponies well-adapted

51
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,709
for the dense woods
of northern Wisconsin,

52
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,834
home to the Ojibwe people.

53
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,834
Traditionally,
the ponies and people

54
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,917
depended upon one another.

55
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,125
- Leah: They're pretty strong
and sturdy

56
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,709
for the size
that they are,

57
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,999
and so, that's what made them
really excellent

58
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:40,458
at pulling things out from woods
and logging.

59
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,750
- Angela: But the ponies
were more than workhorses.

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,959
Em says the connection
between horse and human

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,999
has a deep spiritual dimension.
[rooster crows]

62
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:54,166
- Em: I would also argue that
the ponies are<i>our</i>community,

63
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:58,041
but ultimately,
they are an extension of us,

64
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,500
and we are
an extension of them.

65
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,166
We are intertwined.

66
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,542
- Reforging that link
has driven Em on her mission

67
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,542
to restore
the Ojibwe pony.

68
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:09,792
- Em: My question to you is,

69
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,709
wouldn't you help
your relative survive?

70
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,999
I would.

71
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,999
- But she doesn't do it
alone.

72
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,542
The nonprofit group
Em founded,

73
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,999
the Humble Horse,
is a growing movement.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,083
- Em: This has been
a community thing,

75
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,542
because without community,
both non-Indigenous, Indigenous,

76
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,999
both equestrian
and non-equestrian, right,

77
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,917
we wouldn't be able to do
what we do.

78
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,999
- Angela: That includes
the Wrisky Ranch,

79
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,999
which provides
boarding and space

80
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:46,750
for Leah to train the horses
for riding.

81
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,625
An important step
to their preservation.

82
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,125
- Leah: It's really hard
to convince people

83
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,999
that they should have
these horses

84
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,125
if they don't see them
riding and doing things.

85
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,999
- Em: They don't just belong
in museums, right?

86
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,333
They don't just belong
in a history book.

87
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:03,667
We need to make sure that
there's a future for them, too.
[folksy guitar]

88
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,291
- Members of
the Humble Horse herd

89
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,625
have become ambassadors
for the breed.

90
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,417
A visit to the River Falls
campus, near Em's office,

91
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,999
provided welcome relief
during a stressful semester.

92
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:20,583
- Em: Maybe you can call it
"multi-species social work."
[laughs]

93
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,999
- Whatever you call it,
the Humble Horse

94
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,999
is making a difference
for people and ponies.

95
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,375
- Em: I'm not an owner.

96
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,542
I don't own these horses,
but I caretake for them

97
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,625
And I'm lucky enough
to do so.
