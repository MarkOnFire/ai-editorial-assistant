I let you down ?

00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,654
It's kind of an unusual project.

42
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,158
I play electric psychedelic
banjo.

00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,338
And yeah, we're two musicians.

46
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,139
We've been friends for 24 years,

47
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,676
and we've been playing together
for...

48
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,278
- Josiah Wolf: On and off
since then.

49
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,679
- On and off since then, yeah.

50
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,081
- The project started,
it's Mike's project,

51
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,618
but I've become more and more
involved.

52
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,920
- ? Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ?

53
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,893
Yeah, I mean, I feel like
anywhere we go,

54
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,828
we always kind of get
to surprise people

55
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,264
with what we're doing
since we kind of, like,

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,399
have a very unique sound,
and you know,

57
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,502
not a lot of people play banjo
in the way that I do.

58
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,305
And Josiah, you know,
and his drums

59

and modular synthesizer setup.

60
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,176
You know, we make a lot of noise
for two people

61
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,844
and trying to keep it fun.

62
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:48,482
And yeah, hope we can bring
some joy to some folks

63
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,918
out there, and just
have a good time.
