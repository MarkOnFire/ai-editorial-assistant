This is a silly one I wrote
for my drunk uncle

104
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,830
right after he passed away.

105
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,832
If he was about to crack open
a cold beer

106
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,035
or eat a pulled pork sandwich,
he would say the phrases,

107
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,269
"Boy howdy, hot dog."

108
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,971
I thought that was a pretty
funny portmanteau,

109
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,639
so I collected a bunch of other
portmanteaus

110
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,041
and put them
into this silly song.

111
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,043
And to sing along, you'll learn
a component of which.

112
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,644
It is the same
as the titular component.

113
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,846
I say the phrase "Boy howdy!"

114
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,247
When I say the phrase
"Boy howdy,"

115
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,049
you say the phrase "Hot dog!"
and that's it.

116
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,250
It's not more complicated
than that.

[audience applauding
and cheering]

195
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,052
This song is predicated
on the idea

196
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:48,889
that your heart's a big tent,
that you gotta let everybody in.

197
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,525
It doesn't matter who they are,
if they do right,

198
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,860
or where they've been.

199
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,027
Everybody gets in.

200
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,029
So I'm gonna say--
it's in the key of C,

201
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,831
for those of you playing banjo
along at home.

202

? Oh, your heart's a big tent ?

203
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,435
And when I say that, after that,
you're gonna go,

204
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:03,036
? Oh, your heart's a big tent ?

205
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,439
Like right after me, like an
echo, you know what I'm saying?

206
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:06,607
Let's try it.

207
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,208
? Oh, your heart's a big tent ?

208

Yeah, that was really,
really good, nice.

210
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,013
Okay, let's do it the next line.

211
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,414
? You gotta let everybody in ?

212
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,283
- Audience: ? You gotta let
everybody in ?

213
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,519
- Ooh, you guys are so beautiful
and not perfectly together,

214
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,320
which is great, because it's the
folk music process.

215
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,922
Everybody's supposed to mess up
and look silly,

216
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,090
you know what I mean?

217
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,258
That's the folk process.

218
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,260
Next line is,
? Doesn't matter who they are ?

219
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,428
? If they do right
or where they've been ?

220
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,596
That line's my line.

221
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,398
You don't have to do anything
with that one.

222
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,201
But it does cue us for us all
to say at the same time

223
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,738
the last phrase,
? Everybody gets in ?

224
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,608
So I'm gonna cue you in
on that line.

225
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,610
It goes like,
? Doesn't matter who they are ?

226
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,979
? If they do right or where
they've been ?

I can't do it

230

'cause I'm playing the banjo.

231
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,556
You can do this.

232
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,357
If you don't need choreography
with it, that's fine.

233
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,959
You can just sit there
and look pretty,

for some of ya.

a bunch of things

301
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,110
that you did not know if you
were gonna like or not.

302
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,313
I hope that when you leave one
of those things like,

303
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,315
"Well, I thought I wouldn't
like it and I didn't,"

304
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,616
you tell somebody
that's walking in,

305
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,818
"Hey, buddy, you might like it,"
you know what I mean?

306
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,820
Friends, I wanna do this
one more time with you

307
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,822
as a way to bless the rest
of your day

308
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,024
so that you can take a little
bit of this sentiment

309
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,426
home with you in a doggy bag

310
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,228
and give it to everybody
who might need it,

311
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,395
whoever might need it.

312
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,397
I want to do this last time
for the idea

313
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,665
that everybody born
on planet Earth

314
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,667
could have equal access
to all the joys and sorrows

315
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,669
that life has to offer at an
affordable goddang price.

316
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,238
Let's try it.

317
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,373
? Oh, your heart's a big tent ?

318
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,442
- Audience: ? Oh, your heart's
a big tent ?

319
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,477
- ? You gotta let everybody in ?

320
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,779
- Audience: ? You gotta let
everybody in ?

321
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,515
? It doesn't matter
who they are ?

322
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,252
? If they do right or where
they've been ?

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,224
- All: ? Everybody gets in ?

324
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,497
Thank you so much, friends.

325
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,665
I really love Wisconsin.

326
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:32,866
I hope to see you later.

327
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,034
I'm Willi Carlisle.

328
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,636
A little bit of merch
back there, thanks.

329
