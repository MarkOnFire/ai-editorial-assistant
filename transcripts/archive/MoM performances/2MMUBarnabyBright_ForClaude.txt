? And I'm the kind of girl
your parents warned you of ?

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,646
? I wish I could hold
a steady job like I can love ?

4
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:19,720
? And I swear sometimes
I feel like I could drown ?

5
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,290
? At the thought
of settling down ?

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,493
? Like every other
good girl does ?

7
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,799
? But you still love me
when push comes to shove ?

8
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,205
? And I pinch myself every day ?

9

? Still can't believe it,
when I hear it, hear you say ?

? And I've got a way of winning
every time we fight ?

16
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:32,693
? I can't admit it,
but you're almost always right ?

17
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:39,900
? And bless my bleeding heart
and all its hurts and holes ?

? On the corner of town ?

40
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,579
? I said, help me
find my purpose ?

41

? And I laid my money down ?

42

? With my tail between my legs ?

50

? I left with no more wisdom
than I had before I came ?

51

? And I looked up
to the heavens ?

? I passed her many times ?

61

? And never once our eyes
did meet ?

62

? And her mouth turned up
to smile ?

and she said ?

? Forgotten and unclean ?

74

? Ooh ooh ?

with a relative long lost ?

? I dread this every time
and smiled ?

? Although that's
what I thought ?

86

? But her words pierced a hole
in my heart ?

87
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,943
? She said honey, when did
all this fighting start ?

on your side ?

on mine ?

? I know we can't agree
on almost everything ?
