? I, I spent my ticket to ride ?

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,527
? Going nowhere on a train
past midnight ?

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,930

flickering by ?

my heavy heart ?

? Onto the platform
and there you are ?

? With a beat up old guitar ?

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,612
? And a song about to start ?

13
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,082
? Hold my heart,
oh, hold my heart ?

14

? Oh, let my weight
hang in your hands ?

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,623
? There's something bright
inside your eyes ?

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,159
? I just might understand ?

17
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,297

? You, you pulled me
out of the blue ?

24
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,701
? Far from the thunder of the
trains passing through ?

25
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,070
? And though the streetlights
hide the moon ?

26
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,039
? I see starlight
shining through ?

27
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,609

? In a city of a million doors ?

37
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,444
? Open one,
there's a million more ?

38
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,215
