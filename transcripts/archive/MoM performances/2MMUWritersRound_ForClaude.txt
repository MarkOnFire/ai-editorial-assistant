to go celebrate ?

is boomin', man ?

no houses left to buy ?

Well, we are really lucky

201
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,466
that we get to share
the stage with these artists

202
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,068
and even luckier
that we get to call

00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,838
each of these bands
and artists friends.

204
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,575
So thank you, guys, so much for
sharing the stage with us today.

205
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,911
It's so lovely
to do this at Mile.

206
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,048
Mile of Music is truly
summer camp for musicians.

207
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,850
We get to see
so many of our friends,

208
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,085
not only from around the world,

209
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,287
but also the ones
that we might live next door to

210
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,423
and be gone too much to see.

So, this is a song off
of our new album.

213
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,862
We actually played it
here at Mile

214
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,663
for the very first time
four years ago.

- On this stage.

And this is about the people
that change you,

217
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,837
where you meet them
and you know

218
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,273
that something in your life
has changed.

219
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,642
Something in the stars
has shifted.

220
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,410
So it's called
"Something in the Stars."

- We're gonna hit you
with a song

00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,388
we normally leave
'til the end of a set.

So we're throwing you
in the deep end.

"Scuba Diving,"

May I share what it's about?

Yes.
- Yes?

- Yes.
- Guys, consent is important.

277
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,706
- Consent is enthusiastic
and consistent and continual.

278
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,375
Just 'cause
someone says "yes" once

279
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,210
does not mean
that they are bound to it.

to be a therapist right now?

[all laughing]

283
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,120
But, so, Isaac,
who takes such good care

284
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:55,389
of everyone's mental health
and knows how important it is,

285
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,925
at one point went into
an inpatient program.

286
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:01,161
And in that inpatient program,
a doctor was talking to you,

287
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,564
giving you words,
affirmations,

288
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,432
just kind of, you know,
things to think about.

289
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,633
- He was the intake guy.

290
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,235
He was supposed to decide
whether or not

291
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,636
I needed to be there.

292
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,138
And he was like, "Yeah, you do."

293
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,741
And, also, there was no real--
- Do-- Who was this man?

294
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,143
Was he a stranger?

295
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,946
Did he work there, are we sure?
- I think he was a doctor.

296
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,147
- And he said to you,

297
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:21,548
as you were going
into this program,

298
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,150
"I want you to think
about one word,

299
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,586
or two words, technically,
during your stay."

300
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,788
And they were the words
"scuba diving."

301
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,790
To which you were like,
"Thank you, that's no help.

302
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:31,525
What does this mean?"

303
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:34,194
- There was just a long pause
before it, where he was like,

304
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,396
"Like, I really want you
to think about this one thing.

305
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,465
I think it's gonna be very
valuable along your journey."

306
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,200
And I was like, "Thank you.

307
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,870
I would really like some help
right now, please."

308
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,807
So it was a little
disappointing at first.

309
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:50,477
And it came to mean a lot,
both metaphorically

310
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,347
and just as a thing to hold onto

311
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,651
and dream about
and look forward to.

312
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,121
But, yeah.

313
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,723
- And sometimes, life,

314
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,325
mental health can feel like
scuba diving.

315
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,295
You're in dark waters,
and you're trusting equipment

316
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,265
that you don't know
if it will fail,

317
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,634
and you're just having to
kind of dive in

318

00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,179
- All right,

[all laughing]

481

- What's the going rate on

482
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,653
choices of murder ballad
versus love song in general?

483
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,655
- You know,
it has a pretty strong hit rate

484
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,057
on the murder ballads, but we
know they want a love song

485
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:18,525
when everyone
looks at us scared

486
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,627
when we say the phrase
"murder ballad."

487
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,196
So we're like,
"Okay, never mind, wait.

488
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:23,864
"Yeah, terrible, terrible idea.

489
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,967
We would never do that."
[laughing]

490
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,970
So, this song is also
off of our new album.

491
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:32,906
And just like High Tea
was saying,

492
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,675
mental health
has come a long way,

493
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,077
but it still has
a long way to go.

494
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:40,180
But I didn't know
until just a couple years ago

495
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:43,917
just how far we've come
since the 1800s.

496
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,220
So, shocking.

497
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,023
Who knew that they treated
women terribly

498
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,360
when it came to psychiatry
in the 1800s?

499
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,528
Isn't that crazy?

500
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:55,696
Wow.

501
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,798
Wrong use of the word.
[laughing]

502
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,533
But in the 1800s,

503
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,569
often they used psychiatry
to silence women

504
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,538
who were considered troublesome,

505
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:07,241
whether they were reading
too many books

506
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,476
or were asking their husband
for a divorce

507
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:12,412
or even turning someone in
for assaulting them.

508
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,047
There are all these stories
of women

509
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:17,851
throughout the United States
and the UK and Europe

510
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:20,220
that were put
in insane asylums,

511
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:22,122
and a lot of testimonies say
that these women

512
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,558
were actually completely sane,

513
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,593
and there were all
these barbaric treatments

514
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,462
used against them.

515
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,398
So this is a song
that we wrote about that

516
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:34,168
and wrote it in a fit of rage,
honestly.

517
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,537
And it's because
when you treat people

518
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:38,138
like they're crazy
for long enough,

519
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:41,808
you can actually make
someone go clinically insane.

520
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,677
So this is for the women
of the past,

521
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:47,981
and it's called
"Underneath the Blood Moon."
