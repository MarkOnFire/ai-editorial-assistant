in the stars ?

319
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:53,760
? I waste every night
wondering where we all are ?

320
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,830
? And how we must
be leaving soon ?

321
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,400
? As we should ?

322
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,307
? When I'm standing
by the water ?

323
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,710
? It's harder and harder ?

324
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:14,848
? It's why I get sad when
there's ships in the harbor ?

325
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,787
? 'Cause they must
be leaving soon ?

326
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,157
? As they should ?

327
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:32,566
[gentle acoustic guitar music]

328
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:47,114
? It takes time to know
when you're wrong ?

329
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:53,120
? And it takes even longer
to put it all in a song ?

330
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:56,523
? And I wish it was easy, too ?

331
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:00,360
? Like he did ?

332
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:07,067
? When I'm by peaceful waters ?

333
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:10,304
? It gets harder and harder ?

334
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,073
? I'd do anything ?

335
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,109
? Just to talk to my father ?

336
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:23,150
? But I guess
he was leaving soon ?

337
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,221
? As we do ?

338
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:34,995
? And, yeah, I guess
he was passing through ?

339
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,398
? And I am, too ?

340
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,803
My name's Tommy Prine,
thank y'all so much.

341
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,771
I'll see you
somewhere down the road.

342
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:46,240
I love you, thank you.
