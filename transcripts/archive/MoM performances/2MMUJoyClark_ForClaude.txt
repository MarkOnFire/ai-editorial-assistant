? When I was just
a little girl ?

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,997
? I'd go outside
and listen to the wind ?

5
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,005
? I thought it held
all my secrets within ?

6
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,314
? Peering out of my window
gave me hope ?

7
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:57,491
? There was something out there
meant for me ?

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:07,401
? I'd see the clouds roll by and
the leaves blow down my street ?

9
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:16,043
? I wondered if it'd take my
dreams and set them free ?

10
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,717
? And I tell it to the wind ?

11
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,227
? Oh, and I tell it
to the wind ?

12
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,772
? So now and then
I think about that little girl ?

13
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:55,849
? And how she knew so much
about her little world ?

14
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,858
? But there is wisdom
in a child's eyes ?

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,663
? And when her world
grew in size ?

16
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,369
? It wasn't always
what she thought it would be ?

17
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,810
? But as I travel back and forth
to distant lands ?

18
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,820
? I know the wind still takes me
further than I planned ?

19
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,395
? And so I tell it to the wind ?

20
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,338
? Oh, and I tell it
to the wind ?

21
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,514
? Ooh, I tell it
everything I hope for ?

22
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,191
? And I tell it everything
my heart desires ?

23
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,534
? And everything I dream of ?

24

I've been seeing my friends

on the road ?

162

? And all that's ahead ?

[audience applauding

164
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,761
This is my last tune.

165
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:30,964
And I saved this
because it's a song

166
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,467
that is honoring my grandmother,

167
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,537
who, my family,
we lost last year.

168
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,407
And she used to tell me
to go get my lesson,

169
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,142
'cause I was homeschooled.

170
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,578
And sometimes
when we stayed at her house,

171
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:46,180
you know,
me and my brothers and sisters

172
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,881
would not be doing
our schoolwork.

173
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,183
We'd be jumping on the beds

174
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,751
and swinging
from the chandeliers

175
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,388
and watching cable
and all that stuff.

176
00:15:54,454 --> 00:16:00,127
And when she got wind of that,
she would come down the hallway,

177
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:04,498
and we would hear her slippers,
and it'd be, "chh, chh, chh."

178
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,767
And we'd start,
"Oh, she coming, she coming."

179
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,468
And she'd come in the room

180
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,771
and she'd say, "Y'all,
y'all get your lesson.

181
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:13,674
Go get your lesson,
get your lesson."

182
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,011
And when I was grieving,
and I was writing with Margaret,

183
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,480
and I was just telling her
those stories,

184
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:24,284
and I had this blues riff that
I didn't know where it went to.

185
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,787
And then once we started
working on this song,

186
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,690
I knew exactly
what the riff was for,

187
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,993
and it was for my grandmother,
Catherine Johnson.

188
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,196
And this song is called
"Lesson."

189
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,868
? Ah, ooh ?

for me.

pouring out my day ?

200

? At the feet of an angel,
she knew just what to say ?

and sorrows unsaid ?

her wisdom ?
