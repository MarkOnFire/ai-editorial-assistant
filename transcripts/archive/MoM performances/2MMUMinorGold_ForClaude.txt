13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,962
in different things,
but never written together,

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,932
so we've got a long history
of singing together

15
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,100
and playing together,

16
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,302
but writing is a very new thing
for us,

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,905
so Minor Gold's
a very new project.

of playing together,

which kinda makes it easier.
- And the writing,

20

the writing is the most
important thing to us.

singing is cool,

the most important thing.
