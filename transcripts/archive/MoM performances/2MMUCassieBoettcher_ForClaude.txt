- Cassie Boettcher: I wanted
to play at Mile of Music

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,807
because I went to the first-ever
Mile of Music, year one.

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,876
And I was a student
at UW-Oshkosh,

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,044
and it was so much fun,

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,047
and ever since that, it had been
a goal for me to play

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,550
as a musician and a songwriter.

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,853
? And take a few things
here and there ?

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,822
? For a simple price ?

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,991
It's just so welcoming.

10
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,294
I get to see so many
familiar faces, meet new people,

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,864
just have a great time,
and drink Wisconsin beer.

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,169
Because Wisconsin beer's
the best! [laughs]

love me ?

? Well, I've heard the coast
is beautiful ?

28
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:03,690
? So I guess that means
I've gotta go someday ?

29
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,326
? And see it for myself ?

30
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,466
? Maybe sing a song or two,
just listen ?

31

The crowds at Mile of Music
actually listen to you.

44
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,324
And as a musician, so much of us

45
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,961
are so used to people drinking
and laughing

46
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,863
and having a good time
in the background

47
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,865
and not caring about the words

48
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,867
and the songs
that we've crafted.

49
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,371
And music is my passion,
along with so many,

all these other artists
who are here,

51
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,777
and for people to be quiet
and silent in a room

52
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,014
and listen to, like, every word
you're saying, is amazing.
