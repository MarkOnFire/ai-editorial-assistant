The last song I'm gonna
share with you today

217
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,483
has a wild story,

218
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,285
and many of you
heard me tell it.

219
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,821
I landed in LA with Trevor,

220
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,325
who many of you know
in the audience,

221
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,961
Trevor Jarvis, in Peridot.

222
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,599
And we got together
with a writer,

223
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,903
and we had a brief
for <i>Grey's Anatomy,</i> TV show,

224
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,072
and we're like, "Oh, my gosh.

225
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,407
We're gonna try to write
a song for <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i> "

226
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,178
And so we wrote this song,
and before we knew it,

227
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,481
it found a home
with Little Big Town,

228
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:18,552
and it just felt like the song
immediately knew where to go.

229
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,921
And it found a home with them,

230
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:25,092
and they received it,
and they recorded it.

231
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,894
They killed it, it was awesome.

232
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,031
And they ended up
being inspired to write

233
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,468
the rest of their record
from receiving the song.

234
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:38,839
And so we, as writers,
I don't think it could've been

235
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:41,475
any more of just a humbling,

236

that we'll cherish
for the rest of our lives.

nominated for a Grammy during--
