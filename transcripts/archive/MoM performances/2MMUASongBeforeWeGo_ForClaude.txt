I actually wrote this song
about all the words

162
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,215
I wish that someone had said
to me when I was coming of age.

163
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,150
So it's called "Who You Are,"

164
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:28,021
and it's for anyone
who's ever felt misunderstood.

shows here at this year's Mile.

all through Europe.

the Haunted Churches Tour.

Philly, evangelical.

But...

229
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:30,757
So, a lot of the songs deal with
addiction and depression,

230
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:37,431
difficulty fitting in to
various frameworks in society.

00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,434
We took these all through
churches, all through Europe,

232
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,003
and never once did
a lightning bolt come down

233
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,606
and strike any of us dead.

So you're safe here today
with us.
