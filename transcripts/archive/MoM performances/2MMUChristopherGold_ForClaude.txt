- Christopher Gold: Here's a
brand-new song

2
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,703
I've never played for anybody

3
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,905
in a key that I myself
have never played it in.

4
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,573
[audience laughing]

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,942
It doesn't have a chorus.

6
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,479
And I'm not totally certain
I remember the words.

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,382
It's about when you're young,

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,886
you think you'll have fewer
questions as you get older.

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,053
And you're right,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,723
but the few questions you have
once you're older

11
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,692
are humongous and terrifying.

12
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,463
But it's all gonna be okay.
