To be a Lady Thunderhawk,
you have to learn discipline.

I mean, you're role models.

? For my creator's will
and humility

325
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,187
? It seems my prayer's weak

? I can't speak

327

? Not a linguist

328
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,324
? Does he hear my English
when I vent

329
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,093
? I fear the answer
to the question

330
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,794
? This is symbolic of anguish

331
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,129
? I feel regarding language

332
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,431
? And the obligation
of revitalizing

333
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,699
? Something sacred

334
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,269
? Failure to carry through
is disgracing a nation

335
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,437
? My first tongue's in need
of a face lift

336
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,406
? But deciphering conjugations

337
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,409
? Like trying to find my way
through a maze in the matrix

338
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,344
? Complex hard to start
without an end

339
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,046
? Aside from being fluent

340
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,347
? I gotta push the limit

00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,249
? If I'm gonna keep pursuing

342
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,151
? So I use it in a way that

00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,086
? Relates to my life and vocab

? Bring some entertainment to it

345
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:55,923
? Spit it on a track

346
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,524
? And I take it out the class

347
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,926
? Can't let what I lack

348
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,561
? Become a self-defeating habit

349
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,696

? Comprehend effects
of my service

370

? I need a spark in my desire

371

? From something higher

372
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,271
? Prior to negative reminders

373
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:45,539

00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,107

? Without sweating
or stressing overnight

377
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,981
? So I pray, creator,
give me strength

378
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,449
? Then I can move on

379

380
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,585
? So it can spread around

381
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,954
? Communicate with us
from above

382
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,223
? Hear me now,
my prayers in a song

383
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,992
? I speak 'em out loud

384
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,326
? Grandfather help us

385
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,362
? To revitalize the language

386
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,497
? And ways so we walk
the red road

387
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:11,665

388

- Pat Peterson:
I think it was 1984.

393
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:41,228
I can't remember exactly.

394
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:42,396
We just came over here

395
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,064
because the treaties
were reaffirmed,

396
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,299
and it opened the waters

397
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,836
to come down
to the Keweenaw Bay area.

398
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,011
I run Peterson's Fish Market

399
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:01,081
and 4 Suns Fish & Chips
take-out.

400
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,851
I oversee everything,
but I can do everything.

401
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,053
I can prep, I can filet.

402
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,122
I can make nets,
I can mend nets.

403
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,858
I can do book work.

404
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:18,165
We're from the Red Cliff Band
of Lake Superior Chippewa.

405
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,303
When we got here, there was lots
of prejudice around here.

406
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,038
They did not want us
down here fishing.

407
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,807
They thought these
fishing grounds belonged

408
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,343
just exclusively to them.

409
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:33,914
The cable man would come into
the homes to hook up the cable

410
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:35,516
and he'd say, "You guys
don't belong here.

411
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,919
You'd better go back
to Wisconsin."

412
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:42,222
In school, they were telling
the younger kids

413
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,558
that those Wisconsin Indians
don't belong here

414
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,759
and they should go back home.

415
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,194
They have no right to be here.

416
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,962
In school, even.

417
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:56,003
They don't understand
about treaty fishing,

418
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,504
you know, what we gave up

419
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,875
for our rights to continue
doing this today.

420
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,912
All the land they're on
was ours.

421
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:08,549
So in exchange for shoving us
off our land,

422
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,817
putting us on these
reservations,

423
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,921
we get to hunt and fish
and gather rice

424
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,757
as long as the sun rises
and sets.

425
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,959
Well, that's forever.

426
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,965
All the boys started working
on the fish boats

427
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,034
when they were about 12.

428
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,704
It's a family tradition
for the Petersons.

429
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,908
Our oldest son, Chris,
he runs our fish boat.

430
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,511
- Chris Peterson: Actually,
I like to call myself

431
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:40,280
the head of acquisitions.

432
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,015
Whitefish is our prime target.

433
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,985
Any trout we get
is incidental.

434
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:48,021
It's always a hunt,
east, west

435
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:50,924
north, south,
in shallow or out deeper.

436
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,926
You know, it's always
a constant hunt.

437
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,662
And so I've been lucky enough
to be able to find some

438
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,331
really good patches of fish.

439
00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:58,532
You know,
you have to read

440
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,401
what the nets are telling you.

441
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:05,105
Let's get as much fish
as we can,

442
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,509
reset our gear,
get back to the shop.

443
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:13,914
And hopefully they're not
completely out of fish, so.

444
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:18,452
We have a lot of people that
depend on a lot of fish.

445
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:21,755
I know if I don't catch enough,
everybody suffers.

446
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:26,260
Not just the extended family,
but all the employees.

447
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:29,596
I'm real proud that we provide
so many jobs for the area.

448
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:32,833
You know, when people are
getting laid off left and right,

449
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,235
we're still adding jobs.

450
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,672
- Pat: This December,
it'll be 20 years

451
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,208
that we've been in operation.

452
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,410
So it's just been growing.

453
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:47,814
You know, lots of long hours,
lots of hard work.

454
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,417
All the people
that were against us

455
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:52,286
are now customers.

456
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:56,690
The cable man came in one day
and I said, "We made it."

457
00:25:56,757 --> 00:26:01,094
Here he comes, buying our fish,
[laughing] so.
