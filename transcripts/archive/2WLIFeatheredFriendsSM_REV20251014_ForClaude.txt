1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,170
[birds call]

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,906
- Angela Fitzgerald: Enter the
Featherd Friends Sanctuary

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:10,477
and you are greeted with this:
[birds whistle and call]

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,213
A cacophony of exotic calls.

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,649
- Hillary Kevilus:
The mission is

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,251
to provide the best life
that we can

7
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,687
for the birds entrusted
in our care.

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,658
I have loved birds since birth,
probably.

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,762
- Angela: Hillary Kevilus
manages this sanctuary

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,933
for surrendered, abandoned,
and abused exotic birds.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,503
- Hillary: We have anything
from the budgies to the macaws.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,772
We also have a variety
of cockatoos as well.

13
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,008
African greys, Amazons,

14
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,944
a little bit of probably just
about everything. [chuckles]

15
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,279
- Angela: On this day,

16
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,982
there are more than 50 birds
under Hillary's care.

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,818
- Hillary: I make their food
fresh in the morning.

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,222
They get a mix of quinoa,
barley, buckwheat,

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,759
legumes, sprouts,
different herbs.

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,761
Lots of fruits, and today,

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,430
they got a lot of big chunks
of melon.

22
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,165
Are you ready?

23
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,367
Are you ready?

24
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,570
I would love to have every
single one of them

25
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,638
at home, personally.

26
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,641
This is my way of trying to help
as many of them as I can,

27
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,477
and to show them as much love
as I can.

28
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,645
You already have it, Fred.

29
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,547
This is Jessie's.

30
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,782
- Angela: The sanctuary takes in

31
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,118
25 to 30 feathered friends
a year.

32
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,286
- Hillary: Good bird!

33
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,623
Parrots are one of <i>the</i> most
rehomed pet.

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,692
Because they're beautiful,
they speak, you know,

35
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,527
there's TikTok videos of them.

36
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,096
So people will get them,
thinking they're gonna be

37
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:40,501
the most amazing, talkative
little best buddy ever.

38
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,338
And the reality is, they're
screamy, loud, destructive.

39
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,440
So that's things
that people can't handle.

40
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,308
So they surrender.

41
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,611
Hi.
[parrot squawks]

42
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,812
They come from everywhere.

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,648
Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota.

44
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,350
If they're willing
to drive here,

45
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,186
if they need us to take it,
we'll take their bird.

46
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,621
We'll work on training
some of them,

47
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,723
trying to get them, you know,
more adoptable

48
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,891
if they're not already.

49
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,626
Good job, Benji!

50
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,161
There's your pretty wings!

51
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,830
Pretty wings!

52
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:13,033
- Angela: All of these parrots
come with a story.

53
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,102
- Come on, thank you.

54
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,704
Savannah came from a
very wonderful couple

55
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,107
that absolutely adored her.

56
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,376
Oh, you're so sweet.
[kisses]

57
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,212
They chose to bring her here and
make me fall in love with her

58
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,614
and just adore that bird.

59
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:32,653
[parrot squawks]
Showing off for you, Savannah.

60
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,222
- Angela: The cockatoos
are housed in the next room.

61
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,957
- Hillary: Hi!

62
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,759
- Angela: And one
of Hillary's favorites

63
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,627
is this little guy.

64
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,996
- Hi, Charlie!

65
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,132
It was a very,
very hard surrender.

66
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,333
Come on!

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,701
He's a special bird.

68
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,503
Oh, he is the sweetest
little thing.

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,739
Just wants to cuddle, just wants
all of your attention.

70
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,743
And he's gonna need somebody
that has, like,

71
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,978
all day to devote to Charlie

72
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,113
because he just wants
to be cuddled and loved

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,783
like the little prince
that he is.

74
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,951
They're all amazing.

75
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,352
I could tell you
a million stories

76
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,020
about every one of them.
[laughs]

77
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,690
- Angela: Hillary's personal
journey to the sanctuary

78
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,827
started on a wing and a prayer.
[parrot squawks]

79
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,330
- Hillary: Back home
in Marshfield,

80
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,667
I was a caregiver, and I got
burned out on that,

81
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,203
and I literally screamed
at the universe one day,

82
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,371
"I'm so tired of humans!

83
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,206
Just let me hang out with birds
all day!"

84
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,108
And less than a week later,

85
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,477
I found a job posting
for this place,

86
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,913
and I was just like, "Well,
that's what I asked for."

87
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,648
And so, here I am.

88
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,552
- Angela: The universe granted
Hillary her dream job

89
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,588
at a place that
has a passion for parrots.

90
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,358
[parrot squawks]
- Hillary: Ooh-ahh!

91
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,960
Being able to be here every day,
they call this a job?

92
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,263
I haven't worked a single day
since I've been here.

93
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,998
It's the birds.

94
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,233
The birds are the best.
[chuckles]

95
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,002
[parrot talks]
Uh-huh.

96
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,404
[parrot talks]
And then what happened?

97
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,139
[parrot talks]

98
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,141
I get to hang out with the birds
every day.

99
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,043
I get exactly what I wanted.

100
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,379
This is the first time
he's ever let me scritch him,

101
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,647
so I'm sorry.

102
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,049
I'm just gonna eat this up.

103
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,684
Such a good bird.

104
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,219
I love what I do.

105
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,654
Are you gonna dance?

106
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,988
Are you dancing?

107
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,224
Still can't even believe
that this is real.

108
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,194
[parrot squawks]
You're a dancing machine!

109
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,563
[parrots squawk]
[Hillary laughs]

110
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,431
Are we friends now?

111
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,569
Are we friends now?
[playful music]
