2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,209
- Norman Gilliland: Welcome
to <i>University Place Presents.</i>

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,345
I'm Norman Gilliland.

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,782
Imagine you're standing
on a stage with 85 musicians,

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,585
and perhaps a chorus of as many
as a hundred in front of you,

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,255
and behind you, 2,000, 3,000,

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,825
4,000 people paying close
attention to what you're doing

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,661
to make sure everything
comes out just perfectly,

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,899
and you have some idea of what
it's like to be a conductor.

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,302
But what does it take
to make a conductor?

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,572
What kind of leadership develops
in the course of a career

12
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:42,242
and musical sensitivity
and taste?

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,578
We're going to find out
from John DeMain,

14
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,115
the longtime music director
and conductor

15
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,349
of the Madison Symphony,

16
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,320
and also conductor
of various world premieres

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,889
and other major performances
in this country

18
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,357
and around the world.

19
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,826
And now, welcome to <i>University</i>
<i>Place Presents,</i> John DeMain.

20
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,796
- John DeMain: Thank you,
Norman, it's great to be here.

21
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,199
- Well, this is going to be
a little bit, at times,

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,900
like <i>This is Your Life.</i>
[both laugh]

23
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,669
How did it all begin?

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,471
But let's begin
at the beginning.

25
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:16,343
And you start out as some kind
of a musician, instrumentalist,

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,145
singer,
before you become a conductor.

27
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,714
- Well, actually,
when I was two years old,

28
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,417
I realized I had
a singing voice.

29
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,687
And so, I would go, we
would go to the Italian church,

30
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,522
and they had a ladies' choir,

31
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,757
and I would go upstairs
and sing the benediction,

32
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,893
you know, "O Salutaris"
and "Tantum ergo,"

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,063
you know, and so all that,
and then by the time I was five,

34
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,799
I was featured in
a kindergarten Christmas show,

35
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,467
where I sang
"O Little Town of Bethlehem,"

36
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,202
and my picture was
in the newspaper.

37
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,471
And then, at six,
I started taking piano lessons,

38
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,975
and I learned
how to sight-read really quickly

39
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,511
because I wanted to accompany
myself singing,

40
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,246
and my parents would go out

41
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,982
and buy me the jumbo note
versions of the popular songs

42
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,352
of the time, you know,
and, but--

43
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,753
And I learned how,
for some reason,

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,555
I learned how to
sight-read very quickly.

45
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,224
And by the time
I was nine years old,

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,093
I could really play
and I could sight-read.

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,462
So, at that particular point
in time,

48
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,998
the Youngstown Symphony,

49
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,100
in a co-production
with the Youngstown Playhouse,

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,868
which was a very, to this day,

51
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,106
a very big and popular
community theater,

52
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,175
did a co-production of
<i>Amahl and the Night Visitors,</i>

53
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,310
Gian Carlo Menotti's
<i>Amahl and the Night Visitors.</i>

54
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,612
And that opened in 1953.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,850
And I would have been,
I was born in 1944,

56
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,786
so that would have been
very close

57
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,955
after the premiere happened
in New York,

58
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,357
they were able to get it
and do it, as I recall.

59
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,359
- Norman: Just the right age
to play Amahl, also.

60
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,961
- John: Right,
there were two of us,

61
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,463
and the other boy was like
12 or 13,

62
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,066
and he lost his voice,
his voice changed.

63
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,668
So I did all the performances,

64
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,703
and I had
a beautiful boy soprano.

65
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,572
I don't know whatever happened
after my voice changed,

66
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,708
but I had, you know,
high Cs and I had vibrato

67
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,712
and I could sing all the Italian
art songs, and you name it.

68
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,114
But, and at the same time,

69
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,018
by the time
I was in fourth grade,

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,554
the person who founded
the Youngstown Symphony,

71
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,757
Michael Ficocelli, became,
he used to be,

72
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,426
so, in the 1940s,

73
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,695
when the orchestra wasn't
a professional orchestra,

74
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,131
he was a timekeeper
for Republic Steel.

75
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,534
I thought that was
kind of interesting, you know,

76
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,569
being a conductor.
- Norman: Yes.

77
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,240
- And he would conduct
the musicians and everybody.

78
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,108
Everybody was involved
with the war, I think,

79
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,510
in Youngstown at the time,
you know,

80
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,311
the steel mills and everything.

81
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,214
And then, he got a job
as the music director

82
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,216
for all the parochial schools.

83
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,417
And unfortunately,

84
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,586
the Catholic schools
didn't have string programs,

85
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,088
but they just had bands.

86
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,689
'Cause he was a violinist.

87
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,359
But he had a beautiful
conducting technique,

88
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,762
and so, he wanted me to be
at the piano

89
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,499
when he was conducting the band
rehearsals in fourth grade.

90
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,368
And when he didn't show up,

91
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,837
I actually conducted
the rehearsals in fourth grade.

92
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,005
- Norman: Wow.

93
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,407
- And then there was
an all-star band made up

94
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,643
of the best players
from all over the city,

95
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,845
and I, and he, and they met
on a Monday night,

96
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,447
I remember, and he always
wanted me to go sit at the piano

97
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,250
with a full score
and just watch him, you know,

98
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,451
and maybe play a little bit,

99
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,987
but watch him to see
his stick technique,

100
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,623
which was classic and beautiful,
you know.

101
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,493
And so,
that's how early it was

102
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,362
that I was sort of playing
and conducting.

103
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,364
And when I was in fourth grade,

104
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,702
they sent me up to the eighth
grade to play for the shows

105
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,904
and musical things that was
going on in the grade school.

106
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,506
And then, when I was
in eighth grade,

107
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,708
they sent me to the high school
because I could sight-read

108
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,977
to play for the big school shows
at the high school.

109
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,579
And then, when I got
into high school,

110
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,281
I actually staged and conducted
and did the shows.

111
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:46,320
So I was very active, and the
theater was interesting to me

112
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,821
when I was young,

113
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,224
and there was a children's
theater that I belonged to.

114
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,459
And I remember I played
the grandfather in <i>Heidi</i>

115
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,328
when I was six
or seven years old,

116
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,697
and then when I was
sort of more 12 or 13,

117
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,166
I played Edvard Grieg
in the <i>Song of Norway</i>

118
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,768
and played the piano concerto
and tried to sing,

119
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,537
you know, all that music.

120
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:07,040
But I also was doing
just pure acting.

121
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,409
And then, around when I was 13,

122
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,778
the Youngstown Playhouse
started doing musicals,

123
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,014
and the first one they did
was <i>Paint Your Wagon.</i>

124
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,182
- Oh, sure.

125
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,818
- And they hired me
to be a rehearsal pianist

126
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,587
for the dancers because
we had, it was with piano,

127
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,257
and we had a wonderful woman,
Lillian Butcher Stambaugh,

128
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,627
who was <i>the</i> accompanist
in Youngstown, Ohio.

129
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,562
And she was playing for that.

130
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,064
And so, I assisted her,
and we got along famously.

131
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,169
But the next year,
that musical was <i>Brigadoon,</i>

132
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,605
and they could not, and Lillian
was not available to do it.

133
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,407
And they asked me
if I would do it.

134
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,809
And I was 14, and everybody
in the show was old enough

135
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,011
to be my grandparents, you know.

136
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,746
So I said, "Well, okay."

137
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,382
But I said, "Could I put
an orchestra in the pit

138
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,683
if I could put one together?"

139
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,851
And they said, "Yes."

140
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,853
So I got the concertmaster
of the symphony,

141
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,823
and I got my high school music
teacher who played trumpet,

142
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,725
you know, and I got
all these different players,

143
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,695
and I had a 14-piece orchestra,
and I conducted and...

144
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,564
And then, the union got wind
of the fact

145
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,898
that we weren't paying
the musicians.

146
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,367
And so that came,
that lasted for two years.

147
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,269
And then, that came
to a flying stop.

148
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:13,140
But I was that early conducting,
you know.

149
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,609
And so, that was sort of
how I got the start.

150
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:19,046
- Did you continue your career
as a classical pianist,

151
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,214
too, then?

152
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,983
- Well, you know,
I was always playing the piano.

153
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,420
You know, I mean, I was studying
the piano and I was studying

154
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,090
with this wonderful
German teacher, Hermann Groos.

155
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,060
And he passed away, and I
started studying with his wife.

156
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,863
But I was typical, you know, by
the time I got in high school,

157
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,699
I was in speech and debate,
extemporaneous speaking,

158
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,834
putting on shows
at the Playhouse every night,

159
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,669
playing for every chorus
you could imagine.

160
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,838
Everything but practicing.

161
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,142
Until we got to my senior year
and I entered...

162
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,912
For some reason,

163
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,414
I decided at the end
of my junior year to practice

164
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,750
and just take a shot
at the piano competition

165
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,919
that was presented
by the Youngstown Symphony.

166
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,721
And of course,
that would be the first time

167
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,122
I would be with the
Youngstown Symphony

168
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,323
since I was nine years old,

169
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,925
doing <i>Amahl</i>
<i>and the Night Visitors.</i>

170
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,795
So I practiced, and it was the
Beethoven First Piano Concerto.

171
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,398
I won.
- Norman: Congratulations.

172
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,534
- John: And the judges were
Vronsky and Babin.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,935
- Norman: Yeah, sure,
famous piano duo.

174
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,537
- John: A rather well-known
famous piano duet.

175
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,373
They were on the staff
of Cleveland Institute of Music.

176
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,874
So they came--
On the faculty.

177
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,111
And so, they came down to be
the judges, and they chose me.

178
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,513
And there were people
at Juilliard competing.

179
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,781
So I beat them all.

180
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,084
And I made my debut
in that January.

181
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:36,356
And, I mean, I have to say,
that was sort of cathartic.

182
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,724
I mean, that,

183
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,127
I know what it's like when
these kids win Final Forte here,

184
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,329
and they get to play
with the Madison Symphony.

185
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,730
I-- Don't ask me what it is,

186
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,899
but somehow playing
with an orchestra, for someone

187
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,467
who's, you know,
playing a musical instrument,

188
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,069
it's just magic.

189
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,438
And that sort of
really fired me up.

190
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,773
And...

191
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,375
But I still didn't know what
I wanted to do with my life.

192
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,010
- Hard to believe.
- Yeah, I know,

193
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,613
because I had so many interests
and I had a good grade average

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,348
and, you know,
and of course,

195
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,083
you know, you're going
to a Catholic school

196
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,885
and they all think
you should become, you know,

197
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,787
a scientist or a priest
or whatever, you know?

198
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,456
I mean, nobody's thinking you're
gonna go on in the arts.

199
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:14,127
And so, I remember that
it was March of my senior year,

200
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,797
and I looked in the mirror
and I said, "What do you do

201
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,532
"when you don't have to do
something

202
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,601
like physics homework
or English," you know?

203
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,503
- Good question.
- And I said, you're always,

204
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,571
you're always doing
theater or music,

205
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,275
but it's usually always from a
musical point of view, you know?

206
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,611
And so, why don't you--

207
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,112
And I've been doing everything
on instinct,

208
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,580
conducting on instinct.

209
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,383
Never had a real lesson in that
sense, just through observation.

210
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,886
So why don't you go
get an education about music?

211
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,623
And so, I thought, well, okay,
well, you know, naive me,

212
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,658
why not write to the best.

213
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,461
And so I wrote to Juilliard,

214
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,363
you know,
see if I could get an audition.

215
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,233
And one of the people
that I beat in the competition,

216
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,737
William Cessna, was studying
with the great Adele Marcus.

217
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:01,008
And he said to me, you know,
"You should study with her.

218
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,176
She's phenomenal."

219
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,443
And she had, you know,

220
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,312
taught Byron Janis
and Agustin Anievas,

221
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,748
and she had studied
with Josef Lhévinne and Schnabel

222
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:08,916
and the whole thing.

223
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,317
- Great, great pianists, yes,
very famous.

224
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,853
- And so he said,
"Tell her,

225
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,123
"call her and tell her
you want to study with her

226
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,991
"and tell her you beat me
in the competition.

227
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,060
And that'll pique her interest."
[Norman chuckles]

228
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,464
So I was a pretty mediocre
pianist at that time.

229
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,433
But anyway,
I took the audition,

230
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,903
and at the end of the audition,
she said,

231
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,240
"Well, I will accept you
on probation."

232
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,242
She said, "When I look at you,

233
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,144
"I see that you're filled
with music

234
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,713
and you understand every note
that you're playing."

235
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,316
But she said, "When I listen to
what's coming out of the piano,"

236
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,718
she said, "I would just say that
the piano, as an instrument,

237
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,886
is totally foreign to you."

238
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,554
So...
- Wow, okay, thanks a lot.

239
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,722
- So thanks a lot.

240
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,557
So, my freshman year,

241
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,659
I remember we worked
for about a month

242
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,461
and she just liked
to stimulate me.

243
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,463
And she said, "Try
the phrase this way, try that."

244
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,265
And I was so pliable and I,
you know,

245
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,466
I think from conducting
all that,

246
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:03,403
you know, I was so eager
to sort of do that.

247
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,940
But then, after about a month,
she said, "Play a scale."

248
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,009
And I went up in unison
and down in thirds,

249
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,212
you know, and she said, "Do you
mind if I tell you honestly?"

250
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,515
And I said--
And she said, "It stinks."

251
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,682
- Wow.

252
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,952
- So we started learning
the Russian technique.

253
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,857
And at the end of my first year,
I got an average grade

254
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:27,561
and I played a very
strategically easy program.

255
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,962
At the end of my second year,

256
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,400
I got a scholarship
because somebody said to me,

257
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,636
you know,
well, Bill Cessna, he said,

258
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,137
"This is gonna be tough
for you,

259
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,339
"but don't make any decisions
for two years.

260
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,108
And at the end of two years,
see."

261
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:43,944
Well, at the end of two years,
I played a difficult audition.

262
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,480
I got a scholarship,
and at the same time,

263
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,349
I was taking elective courses
in conducting.

264
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,587
And my conducting teacher was
Jorge Mester.

265
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:57,658
And so, and he was
terrific with laying down

266
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,494
the essentials of conducting.

267
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,496
How do you get from one point
to the next,

268
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,365
different kinds of beats,
staccato beats, legato beats.

269
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,000
Not much with interpretation.

270
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,469
He left that sort of
to ourselves.

271
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:15,409
But, and then, but it gave me,
you know, a real foundation.

272
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,479
And then, in the summers,
in order to make money

273
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,647
to go back to Juilliard,

274
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,617
because of my four years
of being musical director

275
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,553
at the Youngstown Playhouse,
conducting all these shows,

276
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,023
I got a job in summer theater
as assistant conductor

277
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,692
and eventually conducting.

278
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,361
So I started conducting
professionally

279
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,096
in the theater.

280
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,499
And that led to
about my junior year,

281
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,806
senior year, I started
working for the Kenley Players.

282
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:46,974
And that, of course,

283
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,009
was one of the great experiences
of my life.

284
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,979
For 10 years,
I was with the Kenley Players.

285
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,649
And so, basically, I was taking
some elective courses

286
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,453
in conducting
and practicing the piano

287
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,321
and teaching the piano
and playing auditions

288
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,657
and doing everything you
could imagine in New York City.

289
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,858
And then, in the summer,

290
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,660
I would go out
and I'd conduct these shows

291
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,196
with these big Hollywood and
television and Broadway stars.

292
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:12,699
And including
people like Ethel Merman.

293
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,636
And, you know, that's
where all of this was happening.

294
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,371
And John Kenley,

295
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,874
they actually, they did
a musical on his life

296
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,343
this summer at Goodspeed
in Connecticut, you know.

297
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,646
Because he was kind of
a legend in the theater.

298
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,316
He lived to be 103 years old,
and when he passed away,

299
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,486
the theaters,
you know, flew lights at half

300
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,521
and honored him in New York,
you know.

301
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,691
He was an incredible, it was
an incredible experience for me.

302
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,094
So, you know,
that's where my dinner stories,

303
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,730
the stories really start.
- Sure.

304
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,701
And so, you're a full-fledged
conductor now of musicals,

305
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,870
and you were also conducting

306
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,773
symphony orchestras
along the way?

307
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,541
- John: Not really.

308
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,545
I would say that,
you know, I'm trying to,

309
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,348
I was trying to rethink
all of that.

310
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,384
So, when I graduated
and I got my master's degree

311
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,620
and I was out doing
the Kenley Players that summer,

312
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,590
I thought, you know,
I really want to get into opera.

313
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,991
This is where I want to go,

314
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,527
because I love the theater,
I love chorus,

315
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:16,697
I love singing, and of course,
I love the orchestra.

316
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,133
And so, I thought, when I
go back to the city, I'm just,

317
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,470
if I even have to go to a
pay-to-sing kind of company,

318
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,739
you know, I'm gonna
get involved in opera.

319
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,474
And I went to the,

320
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,079
Juilliard was opening
at Lincoln Center,

321
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,016
and I went to an alumni concert
featuring Leontyne Price,

322
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,253
and I ran into Rhoda Levine,
who I had worked with.

323
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,822
She was a great
opera stage director.

324
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,892
And I had done some
Luciano Berio

325
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,294
avant-garde piece operas
at Juilliard

326
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,929
as an extracurricular activity.

327
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,532
And so, we knew each other, and
she saw me at the intermission,

328
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,934
and she came up and she said--
this is like a fluke.

329
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,336
She said, "Do you have any
interest in getting into opera?"

330
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:57,671
And I said...
- Well.

331
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,773
- I've been looking
into a crystal ball all summer.

332
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,108
- How serendiptitious.
- You know.

333
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,243
So she said,
"Peter Herman Adler is looking

334
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,313
"for someone at the New York--

335
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,583
at the National Education
Television Opera Project,"

336
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,385
which was...

337
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,887
So Peter Herman Adler
had been music director

338
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,822
of the Baltimore Symphony.

339
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,624
He now was,

340
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,528
and he founded the NBC
Television Opera in the 1950s,

341
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,198
which brought people
like Leontyne Price to the fore

342
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,999
and all those guys.
- And I think that's

343
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,801
where <i>Amahl and the</i>
<i>Night Visitors</i> came from, too.

344
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,002
- Peter was involved with that.

345
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,704
- They were commissioned
from NBC TV.

346
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:33,440
- Right, and so, then,
when public television happened,

347
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:36,777
that got transferred
over to public television.

348
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:38,779
And so, Kirk Browning
and Peter Adler

349
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:42,816
created the National Education
Television Opera Project.

350
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,787
So this is the days before
<i>Live from Lincoln Center,</i>

351
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:50,657
before all of that kind
of on-site television.

352
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,526
So we would rehearse
in New York,

353
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,329
we'd go up to Boston,
and the Boston Symphony

354
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,663
would be the orchestra.

355
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,966
I was the assistant conductor.

356
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,834
I actually got into costume once

357
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:05,005
because I was, had to do
some conducting of the singers,

358
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,373
and they were in positions

359
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,976
where I was gonna have to be
in with the crowd on stage.

360
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,611
So I got into costume,

361
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:15,482
and there, the musicians
of the Boston Symphony

362
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,452
took a liking to me
because, well,

363
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,921
Peter Herman Adler was
very hard to follow.

364
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,823
And when they would
be doing orchestra readings,

365
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,224
of course I would be
in there

366
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,827
even though I was gonna be
in Studio A with the singers,

367
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:28,328
and he would do something,

368
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,297
and they would think
it's a ritard,

369
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,933
and I'd go and I'd whisper
to them, "Straight time,

370
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,968
that's not a ritard,
just play straight time."

371
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:39,006
And so, they went and said
I should go to Tanglewood,

372
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,440
that I should be invited
to Tanglewood

373
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,608
as a conducting fellow.

374
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,144
And that's where
it really started to happen.

375
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,447
I went to Tanglewood
as a conducting fellow

376
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,650
and associate fellow
focused in opera.

377
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,687
But I got to conduct the
big student orchestra, you know,

378
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,122
and I thought

379
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:58,625
that Leonard Bernstein was going
to be the teacher that summer,

380
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:02,029
but that summer, he wasn't
because of his schedule.

381
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,965
But he did come
for an extended weekend.

382
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,535
And that's my first time
I got to meet Leonard Bernstein,

383
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:09,736
who I later on went on

384
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,740
to have a fantastic
musical association with him.

385
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,043
- You conducted the debut
of <i>A Quiet Place.</i>

386
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,179
- Of <i>A Quiet Place,</i> and so, that
summer, I remember he came

387
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,981
and he wanted to see all of us
conduct.

388
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:24,051
And so, I ran
into the music store

389
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,221
and bought the <i>Egmont</i> overture,
learned it overnight,

390
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,022
and stood up the next day
and conducted it.

391
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,024
And the next day,
he gave us a master class.

392
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,026
I'll never forget.

393
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,628
He got to me.

394
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:35,863
He was clairvoyant, you know.

395
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,764
I mean, he was really,
he was so smart.

396
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,967
And he got to me and he said,
and of course,

397
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,568
you know, I'd never,
I think there were

398
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,570
like eight flute players because
it was the student orchestra,

399
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,973
you know, in the shed
at Tanglewood

400
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,175
and, you know, and I
never saw such a big orchestra.

401
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,843
And he said,
"Have you ever conducted

402
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,144
an orchestra of this
size before?"

403
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,747
And I said, "No, most
of my work has been in the pit.

404
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,349
A lot of theater work
up until now."

405
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,751
He said, "Well, you remind me
of myself when I started out.

406
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,553
He said, "I was Christ
of the cross crucified.

407
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,255
"And Fritz Reiner would tap
on the stand,

408
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,257
"and he told me to sit down
and he'd say,

409
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,058
'When you get over yourself,
you can conduct again.'"

410
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,493
So, and of course,

411
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,395
he still looked like that
when he conducted.

412
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,197
But he told us all
not to imitate him,

413
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:11,899
because when he saw himself
on television,

414
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,433
he thought it was disgusting.

415
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,902
- Can be very humbling,
I'm sure.

416
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,236
- John: Very humbling, so...

417
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,905
But he said, "You're filled
with music."

418
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,072
And so that was great.

419
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,008
So, anyway, that started.

420
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,743
And after that, I,

421
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,481
that summer,
I learned that Julius Rudel,

422
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,751
who was the general director
of New York City Opera,

423
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:35,856
was looking for the, a sequel
to the Julius Rudel Award.

424
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,858
Christopher Keene,
who was in that award,

425
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,159
was been it for three years.

426
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,095
He was leaving, and there was
a stipend for that award.

427
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,198
And so, he was looking
for someone.

428
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,700
And so, they came to me
and they said,

429
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,101
"You should apply for that."

430
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,637
I said, "I don't have that kind
of background to do that."

431
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,139
"Apply."

432
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:55,142
So, in the meantime,
so I apply.

433
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,044
And in the meantime,

434
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,714
I'm trying to save money
to go to Germany to study German

435
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,717
and begin my career in Europe.

436
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:05,352
- It's kind of necessary,
isn't it.

437
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,854
- Yeah,
well, I thought it was.

438
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,388
And then, so in January,

439
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,457
there was a snowstorm
in Buffalo, New York.

440
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,994
I had applied the previous July,
heard nothing.

441
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,396
And then, all of a sudden,
I get a call in Buffalo

442
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,132
that Rudel is considering me
for the Rudel Award.

443
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,769
And when I come in
from this assignment

444
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,272
from Studio Arena,

445
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,274
you know,
we'd like to consider me.

446
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:31,111
So I came there and he told me
to make myself at home

447
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,547
for a month, you know,
carte blanche,

448
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,549
see if it's a good fit
and all of that.

449
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,717
In the meantime,

450
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,852
I had booked a charter flight
to Frankfurt

451
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,055
to go to Berlitz
for six months, hide.

452
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,892
'Cause on a previous trip
to Europe with my dad,

453
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,362
I actually took an audition
for Christoph von Dohnányi.

454
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,763
- Another major conductor.

455
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,598
- Major conductor in Frankfurt.

456
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,002
And he told me, he said, "You're
the best pianist we've heard.

457
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,137
"But if we, I'm hearing
two more people,

458
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,207
"and if they speak the language,
we'll take them over you.

459
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,875
So go learn the language
and come back."

460
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:05,512
And the agents said, "Go home,
study German, come back.

461
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,015
We'll get you a job the day
you get off the plane."

462
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,551
Well, I went back to New York
and I enrolled

463
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:14,454
in the New School of
Social Research to take German.

464
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,857
It was three hours a week
with a good bottle of Riesling.

465
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:19,059
- Just three hours a week,
but you could do it?

466
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,728
- No, it wasn't,
I realized it wasn't.

467
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,263
That's why I booked
the charter flight,

468
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,665
and I thought, "I've got to go

469
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,033
total immersion,
I'm gonna hide."

470
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,401
And that was February 28.

471
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,104
And on February 22, Rudel
offered me the Rudel Award,

472
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,241
which included
a New York City Opera debut.

473
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,109
- Norman: Oh.
- Conducting.

474
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,845
And, you know,

475
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,080
Domingo and Beverly Sills
and all those people

476
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,182
were the stars at the time
at City Opera.

477
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,952
It was a really successful
company at that time.

478
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,820
So do I go to Europe?

479
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,522
Well, it was kind of glamorous,

480
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,357
the idea of going to work
at Lincoln Center.

481
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:53,760
So I thought,
"I'm gonna take this."

482
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:57,030
In the meantime,
one of my roommates,

483
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,765
Dennis Russell Davies,

484
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:01,168
becomes
the music director and star

485
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:03,070
of the St. Paul
Chamber Orchestra.

486
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:07,074
But prior to that,
he was in Norwalk, Connecticut,

487
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,675
working
with the community orchestra.

488
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,077
So when he went to St. Paul,

489
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,246
he asked me
if I would fill in for him

490
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,748
and prepare
the orchestral concerts for him.

491
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,850
And that's where I really
started conducting

492
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,151
symphonic music.

493
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,720
I would prepare the concerts
for him.

494
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,388
I had one of my own.

495
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,023
I remember I did scenes
from <i>Boris Godunov</i>

496
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,992
with Giorgio Tozzi,

497
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:30,898
and so, then I'm one year in the
New York City Opera thing,

498
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:34,201
and I went to Rudel
and I said, you know,

499
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,036
"This is supposed
to include a debut."

500
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:39,006
And he said, "Well, September,

501
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:43,377
next September, you come,
you can do <i>Tales of Hoffmann.</i> "

502
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,611
It was his production.

503
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,347
Now, that meant that
you got to work with your cast

504
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,750
in a rehearsal room, but no
rehearsal with the orchestra.

505
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,486
Foom, you just go in,
<i>New York Times</i> is there.

506
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,321
You bomb it, it's over.

507
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:55,522
So you got to have guts.

508
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,857
- No pressure.
- No pressure.

509
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,358
Terrible, right?

510
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,361
In the meantime,
right after that,

511
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,798
I run into Dennis Russell Davies
on the steps of Lincoln Center.

512
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,800
And he said, "You know,
this thing in St. Paul,

513
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,302
"the chamber orchestra
is really taking off.

514
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,703
We're going full time."

515
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,139
I think the Ford Foundation
pumped a lot of money,

516
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,741
like it was putting a lot
of money into a lot of cities

517
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,510
to have full-time orchestras
and all that.

518
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,112
And he said, "I need
a full-time resident conductor

519
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,449
"to take the orchestra on tour
and do all kinds of things,

520
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,918
"and I'm flying some people out,
and if you're interested,

521
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,086
I'll fly you out."

522
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,255
Well, I said, "When are you
doing it?"

523
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:30,257
And I remember he said
it was, like, a Tuesday.

524
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:33,093
And I said, "I cannot do that
when Rudel's in town

525
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,295
"'cause it'll smack
of ingratitude.

526
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,497
So I've got to come to you
when he's not around."

527
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:39,833
Well, he was gonna be out
of town that following Friday.

528
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,302
So I flew out to St. Paul.

529
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,171
Dennis said,
"We know each other,

530
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:46,907
so I'm not voting, you know."

531
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,910
And I had 20 minutes
in front of the orchestra.

532
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,311
He says,
"Between you and the orchestra."

533
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:55,816
It was my first time
to take an orchestral audition.

534
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:59,653
And I, they applauded
at the end of the audition.

535
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,055
- Great.
- And he offered me the job.

536
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:03,891
And then I thought,

537
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:06,093
"How do I get out
of my contract at City Opera?"

538
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,929
So I went back to him,
to Julius Rudel,

539
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,998
who was kind of a tyrant,
you know.

540
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:14,134
It was, he sort of suffered
from a von Karajan complex.

541
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,136
- Some of them are,
aren't they?

542
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:19,473
Not pointing any fingers, John.
[both laugh]

543
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,874
- Well, we may think we are,

544
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,476
but the union straightens
us out, you know.

545
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,977
So, anyway.

546
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,913
I thought, "I'm gonna have him
play my grandfather.

547
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,648
I'm gonna treat him
like he's my grandfather."

548
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,383
And so I told him what I did.

549
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,718
I sneaked out of town
when he was there,

550
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,921
and they offered me the job,
and he looked at me

551
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,322
and said,
"What would your duties be?"

552
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,658
And I said, "Well, I'd have
my own subscription series.

553
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,293
"I'd have my own
chamber ensemble

554
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,261
"of 12 baroque musicians.

555
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:44,131
"I would play chamber pieces
with the orchestra

556
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,832
and I would take
the orchestra on tour."

557
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,835
He looked at me and said,
"I would have killed

558
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,437
"for a chance to do something
like that when I was your age.

559
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,539
If you want it,
I won't stand in your way."

560
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,041
I said, "Well,
what about my debut

561
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,909
in the fall
in <i>Tales of Hoffman?"</i>

562
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,911
And he said,
he looked at me and he said,

563
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,513
"I want more dividends
from you for that."

564
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,515
I guess he wanted--
I wasn't smart enough to realize

565
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,116
I should have called up
Dennis Russell Davies

566
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:04,518
and said,
"I can take this job

567
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:05,919
"if you give Julius
a guest engagement

568
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:07,921
with the Saint Paul
Chamber Orchestra."

569
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,890
But I didn't, so, but anyway.

570
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:12,359
That performance never happened
because they went on strike.

571
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,961
The City Opera went on strike.

572
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,462
They would have given me
something else.

573
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,298
But anyway,
I went out to Saint Paul.

574
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,534
For two years it was, I think,

575
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:23,904
one of the most joyous
experiences of my life,

576
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,874
because it
was just pure music,

577
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,176
with a great group
of musicians

578
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,079
who were so serious
and so deeply into it.

579
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:35,215
And I got a chance to do
a lot of Stravinsky and Haydn,

580
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:38,252
John Cage, you know,
you name it.

581
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:43,390
And then, so this is how
it sort of all got launched.

582
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:46,260
So I'm doing,
so that position

583
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,495
with the Saint Paul
Chamber Orchestra

584
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:53,000
was paid for by the National
Endowment for the Arts,

585
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,636
Exxon Affiliate Artists

586
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,705
conducting project for young,
for American conductors,

587
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,108
because the big orchestras
did not know

588
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:03,143
there were any American
conductors unless your name

589
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,312
was Jimmy Levine
or something like that.

590
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,147
- Norman: Even then, really.
- Oh, terrible, terrible.

591
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:09,716
I mean, you would look
at the summer schedule

592
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,119
in Wolf Trap
for the National Symphony,

593
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,754
and they were either Asian
or European.

594
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,389
There was not one American.

595
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,090
And those were
the summer concerts.

596
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,259
Those weren't the big,
you know,

597
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,761
Kennedy Center concerts.
- Right.

598
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,763
- So I thought,
"This is not right."

599
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,799
So I came up with the idea
that the six of us

600
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,167
that were in
this pilot project.

601
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,735
It was Pittsburgh Symphony,

602
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,038
San Diego Symphony,
National Symphony, you know,

603
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,040
all these different orchestras,
Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra,

604
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:35,042
that we should do
an exchange program

605
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,243
between...
- A really good idea.

606
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,444
- ...you know,
the different orchestras

607
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:39,046
so that people would
get to know us.

608
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:40,848
So, they went for that.

609
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,585
And my exchange was
with the Pittsburgh Symphony.

610
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,689
So, and William Steinberg
was the conductor

611
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,657
and he was just leaving.

612
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:53,160
And they were,
they had just hired Andre Prévin

613
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:54,895
to be the music director,
so anyway,

614
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:56,296
I went there,
and I'll never forget

615
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,932
because I started conducting,

616
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:02,202
and they played a full
quarter note behind the beat.

617
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,371
So if you wanted them
to go "Boom,"

618
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:06,106
they would go...

619
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,141
"Boom,"
for that fourth beat.

620
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,511
I mean, that was how far
behind Steinberg

621
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:11,778
they were playing.

622
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,080
So after about eight bars,

623
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,681
I stopped and I said,
"Ladies and gentlemen,

624
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:16,283
would you please,
please play with my beat?"

625
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,885
'Cause I don't know
how to do that.

626
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,286
You know,
I wasn't trained that way.

627
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,422
And there was much shuffling
feet, you know, and they did.

628
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,424
They played maybe.

629
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:27,694
And so that concert,
so the night of the concert,

630
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,796
the first violinist came up
to me and she said,

631
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,065
"You know, we're really
enjoying playing with you."

632
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:34,268
But she said, "I just
thought you would like to know,

633
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:39,806
"it took André Previn two weeks
to ask us to play with his beat,

634
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:40,974
"not behind the beat.

635
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,376
It took you eight bars."

636
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:45,179
And I looked at her and I said,
"Yeah, but he got the job."

637
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,814
So that was such a hit for me.

638
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:51,185
And I got these reviews

639
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:52,853
that your grandmother
could only write, you know.

640
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,055
In fact, the critic called me
the next day, he said,

641
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:56,657
"You're the first conductor
to get this orchestra

642
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,458
to play Mozart in six years."

643
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,627
He said, "That <i>Mozart 29,</i>
was incredible."

644
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,462
- 29?
- Yeah.

645
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,865
- Isn't one of the big,
big ones that you think of.

646
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:06,266
- That's one of the big ones.

647
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,001
Well, I did, you know,
I didn't--

648
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,103
The other conductors with
the big symphony orchestras,

649
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,506
they were doing <i>Rite of Spring</i>
and <i>Firebird</i> and all that.

650
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:13,941
Well, not <i>Rite of Spring,</i>
but <i>Firebird</i>

651
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,877
and the big pieces,
you know.

652
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:19,213
A lot of different big,
big orchestral pieces.

653
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,516
That I decided to do
an introspective program

654
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,117
'cause that's what
I would be comfortable with.

655
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:25,752
So I did all Mozart first half,

656
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,788
and then I did
Schumann's <i>Spring Symphony.</i>

657
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:31,959
And so, so the next day,
the Affiliate Artists people

658
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:33,627
meet with me and they say,

659
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,629
"You know, we don't know what
to do with you.

660
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:37,598
"There's nothing out there
right now.

661
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,766
"The only thing we know of

662
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:43,337
"is David Gockley just started
this touring company

663
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,106
"for Houston Grand Opera
called Texas Opera Theater,

664
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:48,976
"and he's looking
for a music director.

665
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:53,280
If you want, we'll put you
together with him in New York."

666
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:56,850
So I went to New York
and met with him.

667
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,218
But the Texas Opera Theater,

668
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,120
and it was like
Peace Corps work, you know.

669
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:02,155
I mean, it was
like going out to the boonies

670
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:03,824
and bringing opera to people

671
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:06,827
who would not normally
have a chance to see opera.

672
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:10,797
But I met with David
in New York, and he said,

673
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:15,235
"Look, I'm not happy with the
situation in my parent company.

674
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,171
"You show what you can do,

675
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,439
and I'll absorb you
into the parent company."

676
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,808
Because when he
was 32 years old,

677
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,912
he went from being business
manager to general director

678
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,513
of Houston Grand Opera
at age 32.

679
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,283
- 32, that's
'cause it's quite a job.

680
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:31,718
- Yeah, and so he was
a wunderkind.

681
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,588
And so I did,
I went down there.

682
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:38,292
It was a shock
to go to this pickup orchestra

683
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:40,894
that was what was left
in Houston.

684
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:43,030
I mean, I remember
after the whole year,

685
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,432
we did an outdoor series.

686
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,768
And I had this
fabulous orchestra.

687
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,369
But they'd all come back in
from Juilliard

688
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:50,804
and Curtis and all of that,
so.

689
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,140
So, but the first year,
I mean, it was,

690
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,842
coming from the
Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra,

691
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:57,277
I mean,
it was a huge adjustment.

692
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,813
But around February
that first year,

693
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,217
we had a little hiatus,
and I came off.

694
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,120
And I was in Houston again
off the road.

695
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,957
And they ran up to me
and they said,

696
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,358
"Did you know that
Houston Grand Opera

697
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:12,759
is planning on doing
<i>Porgy and Bess?"</i>

698
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:15,929
- Oh, that's so, one close
to your heart, isn't it?

699
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,898
- Yeah,
I mean, well, you know,

700
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,566
I mean, I'd learned
about <i>Porgy and Bess</i>

701
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,869
and Gershwin, of course,
as a child growing up,

702
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,136
I loved his songs.

703
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,173
And there was a woman
who guest, Ella Gerber,

704
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,242
who guest directed
at the Youngstown Playhouse,

705
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:32,279
and she had the exclusive rights
to <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the world.

706
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:35,482
And so, and when I'm in
my freshman year,

707
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,117
I went to see
a performance of it

708
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:40,120
at City Center
with Julius Rudel conducting

709
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:42,523
and Cab Calloway
playing Sportin' Life.

710
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,857
- Oh, cool.

711
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,660
- And so, and I was just,
I mean, that was me, you know?

712
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,262
I mean,
I did all those Broadway shows.

713
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:49,730
I did all this classical music.

714
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,965
There was that fusion,
and I thought, I'm...

715
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,867
So I did the classic thing.

716
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,969
I went to David Gockley.

717
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,839
I threw open his
office door unannounced,

718
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,007
and I said to David,

719
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,808
I said, "I hear you're doing
<i>Porgy and Bess."</i>

720
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,010
He said, "That's right."

721
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,611
I said,
"Do you have a conductor yet?"

722
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:05,779
"No."

723
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:07,181
I said,
"Well, you should hire me."

724
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,348
And he said, "Why?"

725
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,683
I said, "Well,

726
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,285
"I'm the best musical-comedy
conductor in the business,

727
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:12,886
"but I don't want anybody
to know it

728
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:14,588
because I'm pursuing
a classical career."

729
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,657
"And can you do jazz?"

730
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:18,959
"Oh, sure," you know.

731
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:22,429
So he takes me back to the
coaching room and he puts on--

732
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,399
so, Lorin Maazel
had just recorded

733
00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:27,134
the first urtext recording

734
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:30,737
of <i>Porgy and Bess</i>
the year before, 1975,

735
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:34,007
which won the Grammy
for the best opera recording.

736
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,176
And he takes me back,
and he puts the needle

737
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:38,779
on Florence Quivar singing
"My Man's Gone Now."

738
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:40,180
And he pokes me in the shoulder.

739
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:41,782
He says,
"Can you do better than that?"

740
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,450
But you had to know
David Gockley,

741
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:45,752
who was kind of a unique person.

742
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,487
So I said, "Well,

743
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,957
"I don't know that
I could do better than that,

744
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:51,792
but I wouldn't do it that way
because--"

745
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,095
I said,
"I don't hear any of the jazz

746
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,231
that's informing the piece
from Maazel."

747
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,832
- So easy to lose that,
isn't it?

748
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,968
Even in something like,
you know, <i>Rhapsody in Blue,</i>

749
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,703
it's easy to lose track
of what it

750
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,905
really sounded
like in Gershwin's time.

751
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,673
- John: Yeah, exactly.

752
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,408
And so he hired me.

753
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:10,544
Then I went to New York.

754
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:12,412
I was guest conducting
at the Juilliard,

755
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,048
and I was working with this
director, Jack O'Brien,

756
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,384
who this past year won
Lifetime Achievement award

757
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:20,721
from the Tony Awards for his
hit shows on Broadway.

758
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:25,692
But anyway, I sort of launched
his Broadway career because he,

759
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,261
we hired him to direct it.

760
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:30,464
And I remember I took him
out to dinner and I said,

761
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:32,199
"What would you do

762
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,835
if you had a chance to direct
<i>Porgy and Bess?"</i>

763
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,904
And without losing a beat,
he said,

764
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,140
"Give it back to the people
it was written for."

765
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,277
And that's what it had,
it had strayed from that.

766
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,146
- Because Gershwin had immersed
himself when he wrote it.

767
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:48,549
Went down to Folly Island
in South Carolina and just,

768
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:52,586
like, spent much of a summer
just immersed in the music.

769
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:54,188
- And it was very important
to him

770
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,823
with that all-Black cast
in 1935,

771
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,225
that he get it right.

772
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:01,228
Back in 1935,
Rouben Mamoulian,

773
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,263
who was the original
stage director,

774
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,498
realized that he didn't,

775
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:05,899
he knew nothing
about Black culture,

776
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,968
but he went and he studied too,

777
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,837
and he threw out all
of his direction,

778
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:13,841
and he made it so that
the cast was really proud

779
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:17,244
of representing themselves
and their culture on that stage.

780
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:21,882
And George, I mean,
that was what he was all about.

781
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,820
So Jack and I,
you know, we, there was,

782
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,626
I mean, I don't like to put the
other stage director down,

783
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:33,994
but there was only one person.

784
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,796
The problem is that <i>Porgy</i>
was in the hands

785
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,564
of one stage director
in the world,

786
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,533
'cause the Gershwins
kept such a, you know.

787
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,535
They didn't let
that movie out for a long time.

788
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,136
They kept such a tight rein
on everything.

789
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,371
- They did, yeah.

790
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,073
- So the significance
of this production,

791
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,774
for the bicentennial
of the country,

792
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:49,576
because that's the reason
why we were doing it.

793
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:51,111
The Metropolitan Opera
turned it down

794
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:53,280
because they already had
a full-time chorus,

795
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:56,016
so they would have had to hire
a second 60-voice chorus.

796
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,251
So they said, "No."

797
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:59,386
We didn't have those kinds
of restrictions.

798
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:00,954
So David Gockley said, "Yes."

799
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:03,457
So we did it,
and it was the bicentennial.

800
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:07,060
And we hired
a Black choreographer

801
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,763
who had her own dance company,
Mabel Robinson.

802
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,166
We hired an African-American
production stage manager.

803
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,735
And then when we, and we,

804
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:18,472
we did it first as an equity
company so, because you,

805
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,108
now opera companies
can do <i>Porgy and Bess</i>

806
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:22,576
in whatever town
they wanna do it

807
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:25,212
because it seems to be
a good resource of Black singers

808
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,548
to create choruses
and all of that.

809
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,216
But we went out
on an equity thing,

810
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,118
and we heard, like, 500 singers
in New York,

811
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,320
and there was a number
of singers who would come up

812
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,255
who had currently been
in the famous production

813
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,124
that Leontyne Price
and William Warfield

814
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,492
went to Russia with.

815
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,928
And they were angry
about the production

816
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,597
because they felt it
did not represent their culture.

817
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:46,266
That it was being--
- Norman: Even Leontyne Price?

818
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,434
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

819
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:51,538
- And so, I remember Earl Baker,
this bass,

820
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,073
tall bass came up
and he said,

821
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,441
"Is that woman directing?"

822
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:56,310
We said, "No, we're having
a new stage director."

823
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,978
"All right, I'll sing."

824
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:00,314
[Norman chuckles]
That's, and so...

825
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,350
But I remember
that first day of rehearsal.

826
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,552
I walked into that room.

827
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,456
And there was 38 African
American singers in front of me.

828
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:12,593
There was not a smile
on anyone's face.

829
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,394
- Norman: There's our cast here,
by the way,

830
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:15,829
posing in Washington.

831
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,698
- John: Yeah, that's them.

832
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:19,433
And, that's them,

833
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,103
and we were getting ready
to do Wolf Trap.

834
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,639
And so I remember that day.

835
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,242
And I started conducting.

836
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:30,511
And at the end
of the first break,

837
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:31,912
it was like a love affair.

838
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,348
They saw
that I understood the music,

839
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:37,651
that I wanted
their spirit and soul

840
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,621
to come through in this music.

841
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:44,758
And that's, and Jack,
the same thing when he directed.

842
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:47,427
And shortly after that,
we recorded it.

843
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:49,029
- Norman: Here we are,
here you are

844
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,430
at the RCA Studios in New York.

845
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,633
- John: RCA Studios in New York.
- Norman: In 1978.

846
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,501
- John: Right,
and that was really exciting.

847
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,103
You know,
when you look at that picture,

848
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,671
you see how spread out we were.

849
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:59,473
- Look where the percussion is.
- Norman: Yeah.

850
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,975
- John: Look at where
the cast is way in the back.

851
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,044
And, you know,
because in those days,

852
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,245
that's what they needed to do

853
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:07,080
to separate sound
for post-production.

854
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:09,750
- Norman: To have the channels
that well defined.

855
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,451
- John: Exactly,
and it was great.

856
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,053
So we were doing that
in the afternoon,

857
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,388
and then we performed at night,

858
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:17,925
and then that spring,
I won the Grammy

859
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,060
for the second year in a row

860
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,962
for the best opera recording
of the year,

861
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:26,466
and everybody recognized that
Lorin Maazel's,

862
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,368
you know, the great playing
of the Cleveland Orchestra.

863
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:29,937
And it was a beautiful cast.

864
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,372
And he gave us
the first urtex recording.

865
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,908
But they all said
that my recording,

866
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:37,444
you heard the American idiom
in it, you know,

867
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,012
that it was so American.

868
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,149
And that's what it needed to be,
the great American opera.

869
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:44,484
And so, and that sort of
launched my career.

870
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:45,819
I mean, in a way.

871
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,121
I mean,
I was really overwhelmed

872
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:49,823
by the response to the piece,

873
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,325
and we were the toast
of Broadway,

874
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,126
and then all the opera houses,

875
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:55,562
all the tours
and all the performances.

876
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:58,065
I didn't know any better
to have an assistant conductor.

877
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,900
And that's when I really wrecked
my shoulders

878
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,803
because I was doing eight
three-hour performances a week

879
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,971
of this thing.

880
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:05,439
And it's a huge piece,
very emotional.

881
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:08,609
- Norman: Yes, sure.
- But that...

882
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:10,744
So I went, the thing about that

883
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:14,481
is I went from those
two years at St. Paul

884
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,485
conducting
orchestral repertoire

885
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:21,188
to starting
to do opera repertoire.

886
00:35:21,255 --> 00:35:22,956
And then my reward for <i>Porgy</i>

887
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:26,426
was David did absorb me
into the parent, and for the,

888
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:30,731
his parent company,
and then for the next 17 years,

889
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,399
I had another year
with Texas Opera Theater

890
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,735
and then 16 years at the helm
of Houston Grand Opera.

891
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,737
I was doing mostly orchestra,

892
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:40,073
but occasional guest stints
with symphony orchestras.

893
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,944
- And that remained
pretty much the case that you,

894
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,680
while conducting, for example,
the Madison Symphony,

895
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:50,017
also conduct operas
around the country.

896
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,185
- John: Right.

897
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,753
And it was the opposite
in Houston.

898
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,488
But it was getting more
and more difficult.

899
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:57,124
I mean,
the more I had success in opera

900
00:35:57,191 --> 00:36:00,427
and doing those world premieres
and everything else, the more,

901
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:04,064
you know, I always said,
in this country, we get typed.

902
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:06,800
You're either an opera conductor
or a symphony conductor,

903
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:10,404
and very rarely can you cross
both bridges, unlike Europe,

904
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,408
because in Europe, it's all
under one opera house, right?

905
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:18,145
The symphony orchestra is also
the orchestra for the opera.

906
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:20,147
And if a conductor
has a success in one,

907
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:22,583
they want to see what
he can do in the other.

908
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,451
Here, we have separate
boards of directors

909
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,953
who are trying to raise money.

910
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,655
So if you want to see
Sergiu Comissiona,

911
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:30,190
you go to the Houston Symphony.

912
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,592
If you want to see John DeMain,

913
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:32,993
you go to
the Houston Grand Opera.

914
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,161
I mean, it's just,

915
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:37,497
I mean, each person trying
to carve out

916
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:39,066
their uniqueness
that will make you want

917
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:40,767
to contribute money to them.
- Sure.

918
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:44,738
So the result of that
is we got typecast,

919
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,241
and if you don't do symphony,
if you spend your life--

920
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,642
I mean,
if you don't do opera

921
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,577
and you spend your life
doing symphony

922
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:51,979
and you've never been
on a stage,

923
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,947
or you've never
worked with actors

924
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:57,784
or been in the theater,
you won't know how to do opera.

925
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,453
And if you only do opera

926
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,288
and you don't learn
the repertoire

927
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:05,492
and you don't learn how to
rehearse a big orchestra

928
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,029
in symphonic repertoire,
it won't work.

929
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,698
And it also won't work,
because in opera,

930
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:14,868
there's always
that slight hesitation

931
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:18,272
of waiting because of the
distance with the singers.

932
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:19,706
And when you do symphony,

933
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:20,874
bang!
- They're right there.

934
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,676
- You don't come down
when that first chord

935
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,111
of the Emperor Concerto
comes down,

936
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:27,014
then the whole world is
gonna hear a cachunk, you know.

937
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,883
So it's different.
- Well, speaking of opera

938
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:34,621
and the complexity of opera,
you have a story about

939
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:38,225
that most complex, perhaps,
opera of all.

940
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:41,128
And that's <i>Aida.</i>
- John: Oh, my God.

941
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,863
So, after I had,

942
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:48,535
I started out in 1976
at Houston Grand Opera.

943
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,506
So I think from 1980 to 1990,

944
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:56,076
I became music director
of Opera Omaha

945
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:58,679
at the same time
I was at Houston Grand Opera.

946
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:01,548
And we were heading into a
25th anniversary celebration

947
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:02,950
of Opera Omaha,

948
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,419
and the general director
at the time, Mary Roberts,

949
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,921
wanted to do
a big production of <i>Aida,</i>

950
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:09,556
but she wanted to do it--

951
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:13,594
so in Omaha, there's
a racetrack called Ak-Sar-Ben,

952
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,229
which is Nebraska spelled
backwards.

953
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,396
[Norman laughs]

954
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,731
And there's this huge
racetrack.

955
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,433
And on the one side of it,

956
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,369
sort of like the
Bregenz Festspiele,

957
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:25,906
in the same way,
there is an indoor...

958
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:27,908
...amphitheater in the round.

959
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,377
It's like an oval
with seats going way up.

960
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:33,347
And so we would do it indoors,
of course.

961
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,715
And so we had,

962
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:38,986
the one end of the oval,
we had built this set.

963
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,022
And then behind the set
there was a,

964
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:43,190
this was a huge space.

965
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:44,591
There was a hole in the wall.

966
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:48,529
And back in there, we put
the Omaha Symphony with me.

967
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:51,298
And of course, we had to use
mics because it was huge,

968
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:54,868
the space, and not conducive to,
you know, natural acoustics.

969
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:58,438
And so, I was back there
with a television camera on me.

970
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,174
The cast was here,

971
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,977
and it was open
out to the amphitheater.

972
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,512
Well, to sell tickets,

973
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:11,018
she announced that she was going
to do the biggest menagerie.

974
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:13,520
The biggest triumphal procession
that you've ever seen

975
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:16,623
with a real menagerie
of animals.

976
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,426
So she had two circus elephants,
one, 20 years old,

977
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:21,828
and one, a year old
brought up from Florida

978
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,297
with their trainers.

979
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,531
She had a cheetah,

980
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:28,235
which rode on the top
of the 1-year-old elephant.

981
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:31,438
She had llamas, camels,
falcons.

982
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,043
I'm telling you, just a huge
array of, you know, animals.

983
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,744
And at the end,

984
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,848
Radamès arrived
on the actual chariot

985
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:42,382
they used in the film
<i>Ben-Hur.</i>

986
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,818
- Wow.
- Pulled by four white horses.

987
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,153
So it was pretty spectacular.

988
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,355
- Somewhere in there, there
might be some singers even.

989
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:49,756
- I think there were
some singers.

990
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:51,124
[both laugh]

991
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:53,460
There were a few,
like, 200 supers

992
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,762
and some great singers.

993
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:59,800
And so, it was our time
to finally, you know,

994
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,101
we'd rehearse
in a rehearsal room.

995
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,637
But now it was time to go out
to Ak-Sar-Ben,

996
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:05,405
actually be on the set,

997
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:09,910
and add the elements,
like the animals, to the thing.

998
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:14,715
So I remember that we had
our first rehearsal out there,

999
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,550
and the sound
was totally inadequate,

1000
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,819
and we had some
rock-and-roll sound guy

1001
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:20,787
who didn't really know
how to do opera.

1002
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,724
So I put a singer up there
with him with a score, you know.

1003
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,727
And then, so the next night
I thought,

1004
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:29,029
"We've got to add mics
and I've got to,

1005
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,198
I've got to come out
and hear it."

1006
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:34,701
And so I told Dale Johnson,
who was the pianist

1007
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,637
who went on
to become artistic director

1008
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:38,705
of Minnesota Opera
for quite a few years.

1009
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,240
He was playing the piano.

1010
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:43,477
And I said, "I know
this is gonna drive you crazy

1011
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,045
"'cause there's gonna be
no conductor,

1012
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:47,247
"but you just plow through
this rehearsal the best you can,

1013
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,417
'cause I gotta go out there
and see what's going on."

1014
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,819
So I am fussing
over these ensembles,

1015
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:57,024
you know, within the act,
one act, scene two,

1016
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:59,459
and before the triumphal scene.

1017
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:02,129
And finally, the stage director
comes up to me

1018
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:05,232
and said, "You know, it's
November and it's cold outside,

1019
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:08,101
"and the animals are lined up
to do the triumphal scene,

1020
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:11,205
and they're gonna get
restless if we don't do it."

1021
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,806
I said,
"Okay, let's just skip to it."

1022
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:13,974
So we skip to it.

1023
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,276
And we do it,
and they come through.

1024
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:19,079
And it's really quite stunning.

1025
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,716
And, but it's not, it
didn't quite time out perfectly.

1026
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,318
So we said,
"Well, let's do it again."

1027
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:27,821
So they do it again,
and this time, it's perfect.

1028
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,623
So now we're gonna go on
with the opera.

1029
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,024
So the animals
are taken off stage.

1030
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,426
And all of a sudden you hear--

1031
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,794
[imitates elephant trumpeting]
You hear this,

1032
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:36,897
this horrific scream
from an elephant.

1033
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:40,667
And then you see people rushing
out from, onto the thing.

1034
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:43,604
And all I could think of
is,"That cheetah's loose,

1035
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,772
and we're standing
here vulnerable."

1036
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,174
You know,
where are we gonna go?

1037
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,976
- Nothing but a baton
to defend yourself with.

1038
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,645
[both laugh]
- Very good, and nowhere to go,

1039
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,247
because we're gonna go
scrambling up,

1040
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:57,217
but the cat can go scrambling
up the steps too, you know.

1041
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:59,052
Well, the cheetah
doesn't come out,

1042
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,556
but the 1-year-old elephant
comes roaring out

1043
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,960
and goes to the other end
of the arena and stops.

1044
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:09,396
And then
all of a sudden, we hear,

1045
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:13,233
among all these supernumeraries,
"Is there a doctor,"

1046
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,835
you know, "among all of you,"
you know?

1047
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:17,838
And so somebody
rushes backstage.

1048
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:21,808
And so, what happened
was that apparently

1049
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,145
a 20-year-old elephant
is unpredictable.

1050
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,647
So he got back there

1051
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:29,249
and he started picking
a fight with the 1-year-old,

1052
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:32,219
and they had just gotten
the cheetah

1053
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:34,454
off the 1-year-old elephant
into the cage.

1054
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:36,490
So the cheetah was in the cage,

1055
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,526
but there was a child on top
of that 20-year-old elephant,

1056
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:42,129
and the trainer went up
to get that child off.

1057
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:44,731
And then the elephant took
the trainer in his trunk

1058
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:48,669
and slammed him
against the cheetah cage,

1059
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,537
actually bending the bars
of the cheetah cage.

1060
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,139
- We have no pictures of this,
alas.

1061
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:53,373
[both chuckle]

1062
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,375
- I don't think anybody
wanted any pictures of it

1063
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:57,544
or there'd have been no show,
you know.

1064
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:00,147
So he broke his collar bone,
but he wasn't killed.

1065
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:01,882
So anyway.

1066
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,151
So the general director said,

1067
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:06,486
"None of this
can go in the newspapers.

1068
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:10,624
We have sold out
two performances, 14,000 seats."

1069
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:14,027
They held 7,000,
"On this menagerie.

1070
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:16,763
And we have to deliver this."

1071
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,966
So the next night, we had
the final dress rehearsal.

1072
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:21,702
It was fine,
but they decided

1073
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:24,371
that there was not good enough
communication

1074
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,306
between the stage management

1075
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,308
and the front of the house
should anything go wrong.

1076
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,410
So they needed to create,
you know,

1077
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,546
some communication and
hang some wires and all that.

1078
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,147
So they did that.

1079
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:38,519
So opening night, I'm in my hole
back there conducting.

1080
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:40,120
And I mean,
I've got this headset on

1081
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:43,457
and I can hear the singers go,
[inhales] "Che..."

1082
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:45,359
you know, I could hear really,
really well.

1083
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:48,529
And I put
a live conductor out there

1084
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:50,497
so that he could give cues.

1085
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:53,567
And, so,
it's going really well,

1086
00:43:56,436 --> 00:43:59,006
and I get to the end
of the first act

1087
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:01,141
and people come up to me
and they say,

1088
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,678
"Boy, are you cool
under pressure."

1089
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,146
And I said,
"What do you mean?"

1090
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:10,384
And they said, "Well, when
the triumphal march started,

1091
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,021
"the 1-year-old elephant
with the cheetah on top,

1092
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:18,325
"they hung a wire to communicate
with the stage manager too low,

1093
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,460
"and it got caught
in the cheetah's neck.

1094
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,362
"And he fell off the elephant.

1095
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:25,732
The elephant got spooked
and ran out into the audience."

1096
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,167
It's packed, of course.

1097
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:29,903
And he heads straight
for the people in wheelchairs.

1098
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,739
And he's a circus elephant,
though.

1099
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:35,676
And they bumped up the lights
and he saw all the people,

1100
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:38,212
and he stopped in his tracks
and bowed.

1101
00:44:38,278 --> 00:44:39,847
[Norman laughs]

1102
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:41,481
So, and I don't know anything.

1103
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:43,283
I don't know any
of this is going on.

1104
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,751
So I just keep conducting.

1105
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:46,320
And then,
and that's why they said,

1106
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:47,955
"Boy, are you cool
under pressure."

1107
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,591
And so,
and the show went on.

1108
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:53,460
And on the Sunday performance,
CBS covered that performance,

1109
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:54,962
and we brought the lights up

1110
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,798
so that there'd be
no spooking of the animals.

1111
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:58,966
And so we survived.

1112
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,133
But that's the story of--

1113
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,169
I think ever since that
production,

1114
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:06,173
you do not see many,
if any productions of <i>Aida</i>

1115
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,741
with live animals anymore.

1116
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,543
- Because that,
of course, that was kind of

1117
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,744
the traditional way to do it,

1118
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,313
going all the way back
to Cairo in 1871.

1119
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,481
- John: Oh, absolutely.

1120
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,250
- And so they were
kind of necessary.

1121
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:18,719
But as you say, unpredictable.
- John: It's dangerous.

1122
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:21,188
- Particularly the 1-year-olds.
- [laughs] Yeah, right.

1123
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:24,124
- True of 1-year-olds
in any audience, I suppose.

1124
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,527
- Exactly,
well, that was quite a memory.

1125
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:27,728
[laughs]

1126
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:29,463
- Now, you...

1127
00:45:30,464 --> 00:45:33,534
I wish we had time for more
of those wonderful stories,

1128
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,436
but I know that
an important part of your career

1129
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:38,705
was working
with Leonard Bernstein.

1130
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:41,608
- Right, well, you know,
we had a series of...

1131
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:44,978
So David Gockley was very
committed to doing new works.

1132
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:47,748
And so, we had
world premieres

1133
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:49,917
by Carlisle Floyd that I did.

1134
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:51,919
We had John Adams'
<i>Nixon in China,</i>

1135
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:55,455
and that was a real baptism
for me to get involved with.

1136
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:57,424
And Philip Glass to get involved
with minimalist music.

1137
00:45:57,491 --> 00:46:00,727
So I did the American premiere
of <i>Akhnaten</i> of Philip Glass,

1138
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:03,363
and then the world premiere
of <i>Nixon in China.</i>

1139
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,200
And, but what happened was,

1140
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,837
Lenny came
to see my <i>Porgy</i> on Broadway,

1141
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:13,207
and that would have been
the first time

1142
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,843
that we ever had
any face-to-face contact

1143
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:20,614
since that master class, you
know, in 1971, in Tanglewood.

1144
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:24,418
And now it's 1976, and
he comes backstage and he says,

1145
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:26,153
[As Leonard Bernstein]
"I waited 40 years

1146
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,921
"to hear this piece
done this way.

1147
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:29,223
"You've done it.

1148
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,958
I don't have to."

1149
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,559
So he liked me.

1150
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,294
So then, I think,

1151
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,733
what happened after that
was a major revival

1152
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,268
of <i>West Side Story</i>

1153
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:43,337
with all the original creators,
Steve Sondheim,

1154
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:45,672
Arthur Laurents, Jerome Robbins,
and Lenny.

1155
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,941
And Debbie Allen won the Tony
in that production.

1156
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,376
I was the musical director.

1157
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:51,211
He asked me
if I would be musical director,

1158
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:53,747
and Houston Grand Opera
gave me 15 weeks,

1159
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,683
five, five, and five
to do the show,

1160
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:00,387
and do the first five weeks
of the run on Broadway.

1161
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:03,590
So that's what I worked,
started working really closely

1162
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:06,126
with Lenny,
and a lot of insights.

1163
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:08,662
I mean, that's what
I got to go to the Dakotas.

1164
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:10,464
And so,
when I saw the film this year,

1165
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:12,432
Lenny, you know,
the <i>Maestro</i> film,

1166
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,334
and they went into the Dakotas.

1167
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:16,570
And I remember that's exactly
how that apartment looked.

1168
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:18,805
You know, and...
- In New York.

1169
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:21,375
- In New York, that where
John Lennon was killed in front,

1170
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:22,576
you know,
where Yoko Ono lived.

1171
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:23,977
And Lauren Bacall lived
in that building.

1172
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:25,979
- Norman: A lot of famous people
lived there once.

1173
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,381
- And Lenny had
a huge apartment.

1174
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:28,815
I remember there was
a couple harpsichords

1175
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:31,518
and a grand piano
and a gorgeous library

1176
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:33,086
and was really quite wonderful.

1177
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:36,256
And so, I mean,
I won't get into all the stuff,

1178
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:40,127
but my favorite part
of all of that was...

1179
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:42,529
The, it was,

1180
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:44,932
all those creators
had become now big stars

1181
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:46,433
in their own time.

1182
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,035
Jerome Robbins, Sondheim,

1183
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:49,570
you know, at this point,
you know,

1184
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:52,239
they're all having big,
big careers, big successes.

1185
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:55,776
So now they all have to go back
to 1957, you know?

1186
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:59,079
And Lenny was always
the bull in the china closet.

1187
00:47:59,146 --> 00:48:01,281
Lenny would give notes on stuff
that was none of his--

1188
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:03,116
costumes,
makeup, everything, you know.

1189
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:05,953
So we'd be,
we were out of town in Miami

1190
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:07,120
previewing the show,

1191
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:10,257
getting ready to come
to Broadway, and...

1192
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:12,259
So Lenny and I
were walking home one night

1193
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:13,994
and he said...

1194
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:18,198
Well, actually, Jerome Robbins
stopped taking his notes,

1195
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:19,700
had the assistant director
take it.

1196
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:21,802
The assistant director stopped
taking his notes.

1197
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:24,204
Had the gofer take it.
- Too much to keep up with.

1198
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:26,206
- So everybody was walking
out on Lenny, you know.

1199
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,008
And so he looked at me
and he said,

1200
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,410
"You think I don't see that they
don't wanna take my notes

1201
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:32,412
at the end of these
previews and they all leave?"

1202
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:33,580
He said,
"You know why?

1203
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:34,748
They're jealous."

1204
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,149
I said, "What do you mean,
jealous?"

1205
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:37,317
He said,
"Think about it.

1206
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,719
"Next week,
when we open, on Wednesday,

1207
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:39,887
"on Thursday morning,

1208
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:41,388
"what's that newspaper
gonna say?

1209
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:44,324
"'Last night, Leonard
Bernstein's <i>West Side Story</i> .'

1210
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:46,660
"So when's the last time
you went to the Met

1211
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:48,228
"and they were reviving <i>Aida,</i>

1212
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:50,063
"and the next day,
the newspaper said,

1213
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,500
'Last night, Ghislanzoni's <i>Aida</i>
was revived at the Met?'"

1214
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:55,202
He said, "It's all
about the composer."

1215
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,603
So that was that.

1216
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,006
- Well, yeah, he had a point.
- Then the next thing.

1217
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:02,242
So then, we would go every year
to Sondheim

1218
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,244
to ask him
if he would give us an opera,

1219
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:05,646
but he said
he didn't write operas.

1220
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:06,914
That he couldn't be on,

1221
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,715
he couldn't have just two
dress rehearsals and open.

1222
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,318
He needed a month in Boston
to get all the jokes right.

1223
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:16,356
But Lenny accepted a commission
to write <i>A Quiet Place.</i>

1224
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:20,694
And so, there were
three workshops in New York

1225
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:24,565
which we attended
but didn't participate in.

1226
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,134
And Lenny got nervous
that I didn't participate.

1227
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,902
Well, we didn't even have
the music yet.

1228
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,170
I'm gonna make
myself important

1229
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:32,072
and talk about something
I don't even know?

1230
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,409
But we observed, and he
actually, and Stephen Wadsworth,

1231
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:37,477
who's the librettist,
they made their own changes.

1232
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,913
They didn't really come to us
and say, "What did you think?"

1233
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,415
They wanted it for themselves.

1234
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:43,483
And we just observed.

1235
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:47,688
So anyway, David Gockley,
Lenny was--

1236
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:50,390
I remember we were at Tanglewood
when he came out that summer,

1237
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:53,827
and I think we were doing
the Missa solemnis,

1238
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:56,830
and he wasn't happy
with us singing in the chorus.

1239
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,233
And the two and a half hours
of the rehearsal was over.

1240
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,834
And he said,
"Well, I'm not done yet.

1241
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:02,436
"Just bring donuts and coffee

1242
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:04,104
for the entire orchestra
and chorus."

1243
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:07,274
I mean, like the Red Seas
parted him, whatever he wanted.

1244
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,910
So all we could imagine that
he was gonna come down here

1245
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:12,379
at Houston Grand Opera
and bankrupt us.

1246
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,881
So David Gockley said to me,

1247
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:16,316
"Why don't you talk to him

1248
00:50:16,383 --> 00:50:18,685
"and see if you could get him
to agree

1249
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:20,487
"that we'll give him
an half an hour overtime?

1250
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:22,923
We'll make every rehearsal
a three-hour rehearsal."

1251
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,292
And that's two different operas,
<i>Trouble in Tahiti</i>

1252
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,627
and <i>A Quiet Place,</i> right?

1253
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,629
'Cause Trouble in Tahiti was--
- Norman: Two short ones.

1254
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,230
- The short one,
and <i>A Quiet Place</i>

1255
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:32,566
is a sequel
to <i>Trouble in Tahiti.</i>

1256
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,635
So I learned something
about Lenny.

1257
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,470
So I called him on the phone

1258
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:39,406
and we started making
arrangements,

1259
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:41,475
and he said, "So when's
the first day of rehearsal?"

1260
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,944
I said, "Well, you know, like
May 2 or something like that."

1261
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:45,913
And he said, "Well-..."
I said, "No, no, no.

1262
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:47,714
I don't want you to come
for a week."

1263
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:49,950
I said, "If you come, you're
gonna do those rehearsals,

1264
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:51,952
"and I will stand on the side
and watch you.

1265
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,353
"And I will never own the piece.

1266
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,556
"So I'm gonna do
the music rehearsals for a week,

1267
00:50:55,622 --> 00:50:58,125
and then you come and
you tell us anything you want."

1268
00:50:58,192 --> 00:50:59,993
"So you want me to wait a week?"

1269
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,763
And he said to his secretary,
"Jim, make it for May 8.

1270
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:03,931
We fly out to Houston."

1271
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:05,999
And I said, "And then,

1272
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:08,268
"as far as the orchestra
rehearsals are concerned,

1273
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:09,770
"we'll give you three hours

1274
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:12,806
for every orchestra rehearsal,
but not one second more."

1275
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:14,842
"I could have three hours
for every rehearsal?"

1276
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:16,410
"Yes, but not one second more."

1277
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:17,578
"Deal."

1278
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:18,745
He would always say, "Deal."

1279
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:19,913
[Norman chuckles]
"Deal."

1280
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,648
So he comes out.

1281
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:25,385
And we have staged,
this is that photo,

1282
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:29,923
we have staged the first act
of <i>A Quiet Place</i> or first scene,

1283
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,859
'cause there was
three giant scenes,

1284
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,528
and there was the funeral
of Dinah,

1285
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:38,298
who was the person
in <i>Trouble in Tahiti,</i> you know.

1286
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:41,835
And she's now, these people,
these two characters

1287
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:43,504
are fashioned
after Lenny's parents.

1288
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,138
- Oh, that's right,
I remember that.

1289
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:47,341
- You know, and so--
- Yeah, in <i>Trouble in Tahita.</i>

1290
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:48,742
- So she's there
at the funeral,

1291
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:54,181
and the kids are 1980s neurotic
messes, you know, and...

1292
00:51:54,248 --> 00:51:57,417
So, anyway, we're doing it,
and Lenny's watching it.

1293
00:51:57,484 --> 00:52:00,254
And he's, [snorts]
he's crying and snorting.

1294
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,756
and he's, "Gefi'l.
[muttering]

1295
00:52:02,823 --> 00:52:04,591
You're all so wonderful,
I say..."

1296
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:06,126
[sobbing, snorting]

1297
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:08,795
Fine, I said,
"Well, Lenny, it's 8:30

1298
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:10,464
"and we have another hour.

1299
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:11,932
"So we thought we would do,

1300
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,734
"we would sing for you
the second scene

1301
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,270
that we're about to stage."

1302
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:17,838
So we sing and he,
[snorts, cries]

1303
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:19,640
he's crying and he's
"gefi'l"ing and all that,

1304
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:21,708
and he's just so
overcome with emotion.

1305
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:23,410
He had two tiny notes.

1306
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:24,978
Now it's 9:30.

1307
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:26,914
There's another hour left
to the rehearsal.

1308
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,651
So I turned to the stage
director and said, "It's yours."

1309
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:34,421
Well, the stage director was not
about to do initial staging

1310
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,391
in front of the librettist
and the composer.

1311
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:40,394
So they go
sit in a bench on the side,

1312
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,562
Lenny and Steve.

1313
00:52:41,628 --> 00:52:43,497
And Peter Schifter,
who was directing,

1314
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:46,066
goes out to the center
of this warehouse in Chinatown

1315
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:47,701
where we were rehearsing
this piece,

1316
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:50,771
and, in Houston,
and he whispers,

1317
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:52,573
[whispering] "So how do
you feel about your character?"

1318
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:53,941
You know,
he's whispering through this

1319
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,309
and he's talking like this.

1320
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:59,146
So after 20 minutes,
Lenny gets up, goes around,

1321
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:00,948
and the general director's
over there on the side,

1322
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,115
David Gockley.

1323
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,951
And he goes,
and he says, "David.

1324
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,953
"We should fire Peter Schifter

1325
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,488
and hire Stephen Wadsworth
to direct."

1326
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:10,824
And Schifter's directing
<i>Trouble in Tahiti</i> as well,

1327
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:11,992
of course, you know.

1328
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,528
And David turns as white
as a ghost.

1329
00:53:14,595 --> 00:53:18,966
He calls me over and he says,
"Lenny wants to fire Peter."

1330
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,167
And I don't know,
you know.

1331
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:21,668
Moments like that,
I'm pretty fast.

1332
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:25,072
I said to, and I always would
never talk back to David.

1333
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:27,207
But David did not like
confrontation.

1334
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:29,276
So I said to him,
"You stay out of this.

1335
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:31,178
I'll handle it."

1336
00:53:31,245 --> 00:53:33,580
So after the rehearsal is over

1337
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:35,582
and all the notes are given
and we're sitting there.

1338
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:39,586
Lenny says, "So about,
you know, the director.

1339
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:40,954
"You know,
where I come from,

1340
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:43,090
"all the direction is written
down in the book,

1341
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:44,992
"and all he has to do
is block it.

1342
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,927
"And so it's clear he doesn't
know the score,

1343
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,495
and he should..."

1344
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:51,665
So I looked at him.
I said, "Lenny...

1345
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,634
"We did the first scene
memorized

1346
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,103
"and fully staged,
and you wept.

1347
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,504
Were you lying?"

1348
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:59,173
"Oh, no, I loved it."

1349
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:02,142
So I said, "Yeah, so Wednesday,
you come back

1350
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:03,744
and we will perform for you."

1351
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,945
No,
"Saturday you'll come back,

1352
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:06,446
"we'll perform for you act two.

1353
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:08,015
And then Wednesday,
we'll do act three."

1354
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,183
"Saturday, act two?"

1355
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,350
"Yes."

1356
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,752
"Deal."

1357
00:54:11,818 --> 00:54:14,288
I saved that director's job
because Lenny was jumping off,

1358
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:17,424
you know,
and Steven was driving him crazy

1359
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:19,459
because Steven wished
he was directing.

1360
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:21,695
And he's a great director,
so it was really difficult.

1361
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:23,430
So anyway.

1362
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:26,166
We opened,
opening night, it was a great,

1363
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:27,901
it was, you know, I mean,

1364
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:30,370
my personal experience
with Lenny,

1365
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,738
I will just finish by saying,

1366
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,740
the first day
the Houston Symphony sat

1367
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:35,209
to read the music,

1368
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:38,245
he came in, and he came in
with Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal,

1369
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:41,515
who were the original arrangers
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

1370
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:43,016
And he came in with them

1371
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,919
'cause they were helping
him notate the orchestration.

1372
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:48,622
And he was still writing
the interludes at that point.

1373
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:50,224
And I start.

1374
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,159
And I put the baton down,
he jumped up.

1375
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:53,927
And I turned to Lenny,
and I said,

1376
00:54:53,994 --> 00:54:55,996
"Me first, then you."

1377
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,598
He sat down.

1378
00:54:57,664 --> 00:55:00,367
And I said, "You know,
there's an alto clef

1379
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:02,836
missing in the viola part
that should be in E-flat."

1380
00:55:02,903 --> 00:55:04,505
And I'm going through
all this stuff.

1381
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:05,706
"Lenny."

1382
00:55:05,772 --> 00:55:07,274
So then he gets up and gives

1383
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:09,076
whatever little note
he wants to say, you know.

1384
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,944
But I ran the rehearsal.

1385
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:13,213
So at the intermission,
he takes me

1386
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,216
and he puts me in a hold
like this and hugs me.

1387
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:17,417
You know, and then we,

1388
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,453
then comes the second half
of the rehearsal.

1389
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,890
There's a really difficult
Stravinsky-like "Sam's Aria,"

1390
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:25,058
which I got
the Houston Symphony to play.

1391
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,527
At the end
of that rehearsal,

1392
00:55:26,593 --> 00:55:29,663
he called me over and he said,
"You're the real thing."

1393
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,864
He said,
"You're a real conductor."

1394
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:33,200
He said,
"You know my piece.

1395
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,002
"You know how to rehearse.

1396
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:36,503
"I can't believe how fast

1397
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,705
you got that orchestra
to play 'Sam's Aria.'"

1398
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:40,841
He said, "I just wanna tell you
I love you."

1399
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:42,109
[Norman chuckles]
And so,

1400
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,411
but he worked
on such positive energy always.

1401
00:55:44,478 --> 00:55:48,415
He made everybody be better
than himself, you know?

1402
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:50,083
And people tease me
all the time

1403
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,720
because I always talk about
metronome markings.

1404
00:55:53,787 --> 00:55:56,924
But, so we were getting
this show on its feet.

1405
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,326
And he said to me one day,
"When can I come in

1406
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:00,727
"and just go through
the whole score

1407
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:02,863
and say anything
I want with the singers?"

1408
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,265
And I said, "Well, we
have to get out of the theater

1409
00:56:05,332 --> 00:56:06,433
for a Houston Symphony concert."

1410
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,835
So he shows up
with a metronome,

1411
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:10,237
and we go through the
whole score and he says to us,

1412
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:14,741
he says, "You know, you're
all doing such a wonderful job.

1413
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:16,143
"But Maria Callas said

1414
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,145
"you should be able to close
your eyes

1415
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:21,782
and hear all the acting
in the throat."

1416
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:24,051
And so we started.

1417
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:27,588
And then he started
checking the metronome markings.

1418
00:56:27,654 --> 00:56:29,923
And we had gotten so facile
with the piece

1419
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,825
that everything was faster
than he wrote.

1420
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,228
So then he said, "Do you mind
trying it, what I wrote?"

1421
00:56:34,294 --> 00:56:35,829
And then he'd say,
"It's what I wrote."

1422
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:36,997
I said, "You got it."

1423
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,999
So he was someone
who was a stickler for that.

1424
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,968
So that was my Lenny experience.

1425
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,703
- Norman: Well...

1426
00:56:43,003 --> 00:56:45,138
I'd like to hear more.
[John laughs]

1427
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:47,908
But for a future occasion.

1428
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:50,077
And thank you very much

1429
00:56:50,143 --> 00:56:52,446
for sharing just a little bit
of John DeMain with us,

1430
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:55,682
and your long and very rich
and varied career.

1431
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:57,951
- Oh, well, thank you,
my pleasure.

1432
00:56:58,018 --> 00:56:59,119
- I'm Norman Gilliland,

1433
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,121
and I hope you can join me
next time around

1434
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:04,191
for <i>University Place Presents.</i>

1435
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,427
