00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,003
[gentle music]

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,805
- Cora Borgens: All right,
hello, all, and welcome

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,875
to "I'm Cutting You Off,
or Plant Pruning Basics."

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,810
We will be covering a lot today.

5
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,379
I kind of crammed almost
a whole college semester

6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,081
into a one-hour presentation.

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,782
But like Tina was kind enough
to say,

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,385
this presentation is recorded,
so you can go back

9
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,720
and watch it later.

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,855
And please hold all questions
'til the end.

11
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,359
I'll have, I'll leave as much
time as I can to go over them,

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,427
otherwise
I will hang around outside

13
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,497
after the presentation as well.

14
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,867
To start us off,
hello, my name is Cora.

15
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,203
I graduated
from Washington State University

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,705
with a degree
in integrated plant sciences.

17
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,942
I have to give kudos to one of
my professors and my school mom,

18
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,243
Carol Kawula,

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,514
whose teachings were the
foundation of this presentation.

20
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,682
While in school,

21
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,350
I interned at the
Sarah P. Duke Gardens

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,618
in Durham, North Carolina,

23
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,288
which really solidified
my love for botanic gardens

24
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,223
and public gardening.

25
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,492
My first job out of college
brought me to Wisconsin

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,127
and almost didn't keep me here,

27
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,929
but I found such
an amazing community

28
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,097
that I couldn't bring myself
to leave.

29
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,732
I currently work
in the medical field,

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,000
but I'm working on the side

31
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,436
in science communication
and freelance horticulture.

32
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,471
I'm a cat mom
to two furry scoundrels,

33
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,876
and I knit prolifically in
every minute of my spare time.

34
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,511
So some topics
we'll cover today.

35
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,546
We'll talk about
why pruning matters.

36
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,783
Why do we worry about it
in the first place?

37
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,519
We'll talk a little bit
about pruning equipment

38
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,389
and basic info about what to use
and when to use it.

39
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,058
We'll talk about
some plant anatomy,

40
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,994
looking at how plants grow
so that we can best understand

41
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,629
how to prune them.

42
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,431
Tree injury
and compartmentalization.

43
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,333
Another facet
of plant anatomy

44
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,703
that gets its own section
due to how important it is.

45
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,539
And how to exactly make
your pruning cuts.

46
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,075
We'll talk about
plant growth types and pruning,

47
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,143
because how the plant grows
naturally

48
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,546
will affect how you want
to prune it.

49
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,481
And finally, we'll have
a short little section

50
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,649
on pruning conifers

51
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,118
because they're a little bit
more tricky

52
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,355
to prune because they grow
a little differently.

53
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,991
So to start off
our first section, why pruning?

54
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,927
The definition of pruning
is the removal or reduction

55
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,831
of parts of a plant
for a variety of reasons.

56
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,901
Some of those reasons
can include pruning to enhance

57
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:19,306
or restrict size or form of the
plant, form meaning shape.

58
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,709
We can prune to prolong
the future health of a plant

59
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,913
or to renovate old plant growth.

60
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,082
We can prune to train a plant
for future growth.

61
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,086
Usually, this has to do
with pruning trees.

62
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,124
Pruning to enhance flowering
or fruiting of a plant.

63
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,059
To ensure safety
in the landscape.

64
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,228
This is huge
in a public setting,

65
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,698
but just as important
in your own backyard.

66
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,533
And finally,
pruning to help a plant

67
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,569
serve a specific purpose
in the landscape.

68
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,705
It could be a shade plant,
a privacy screen,

69
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:56,677
or pruning to increase airflow
or light to an area.

70
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,945
In general,

71
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,913
the desired pruning outcome
for most landscape plants

72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,115
is for the plant
to not look like you touched it

73
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,851
in the first place.

74
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,823
So we have this saying
in landscape design

75
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,091
and landscape management,

76
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,227
"You wanna put the right plant
in the right place."

77
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,297
So a design goal is that you
wanna maximize the plant size

78
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,600
to fit its desired volume.

79
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,635
But when this doesn't go
quite right,

80
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:26,540
pruning can help us take
control of the situation again.

81
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,309
For example,
the image on the left there,

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,777
the shrubs are fully grown,

83
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,680
but they're not overgrowing
the pathway.

84
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,849
On the right, that shrub
has gotten too big.

85
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,752
It's now in the pathway and
is a hazard to your eyeballs.

86
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,621
We don't want that.

87
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,657
Pruning can be done
when plants are actively growing

88
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,825
or when they're dormant,

89
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,294
and some plants prefer it
when actively growing

90
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,163
versus when they're dormant.

91
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,201
Winter pruning is fun
this time of year.

92
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,337
There's a few benefits
to this,

93
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,542
so plants are ready
to start growing really quickly

94
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,709
in the spring.

95
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,144
As soon
as the temperatures warm up,

96
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,213
they're gonna push out
a lot of new growth.

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,916
This means if you make
your pruning cuts now,

98
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,351
they can seal off those wounds
pretty quickly

99
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,556
and start pushing out new growth
as soon as spring hits.

100
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,792
Winter makes it easier to see
any issues with your plants,

101
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,561
especially with deciduous trees

102
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,130
where the leaves
might be covering up problems.

103
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,798
But now,
with all those leaves gone,

104
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,733
you can see what issues
there might be

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,570
and plan what you wanna do
for your pruning.

106
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,573
And winter tends to be
a less busy time for you

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,308
and for landscaping
professionals,

108
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,009
though not always.

109
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,311
But regardless,

110
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,880
it's a good time to just kind of
walk around your yard

111
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:44,184
and make notes of what you might
wanna do come springtime.

112
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,153
Some things
you wanna watch out for.

113
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,823
You don't wanna prune if
there's a hard frost forecasted.

114
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,692
If temperatures drop rapidly

115
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,962
while that pruning wound is
still wet and open,

116
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,165
the freezing temperatures
can cause

117
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,600
that moisture to expand

118
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,669
and will cause damage
to those plant tissues.

119
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,771
Some plants are known
as bleeders.

120
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:08,008
Sap can leak out
of their pruning cuts,

121
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,577
and so you want to avoid
pruning them this time of year.

122
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:15,349
Some examples of bleeders
are birch, elm, dogwood,

123
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,317
walnuts, and maples.

124
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,453
Where do we get maple syrup
from?

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,621
Maple trees.

126
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,022
What time do we get maple syrup?

127
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,357
About this time of year

128
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,325
because that sap
is flowing early.

129
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,529
So if you were to prune a maple
this early in the spring,

130
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,698
it'll start this bleeding
or leaking the sap.

131
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:36,904
It looks scary, but I promise
it does not hurt the plant.

132
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,239
Some other things
to watch out for

133
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,776
are your early spring bloomers
or fruiting plants.

134
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,412
So these plants set their buds
at the end

135
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,980
of the previous growing season,

136
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,150
and those buds sit on the plant
and sit dormant all winter

137
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,186
until those temperatures start
to warm up.

138
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,587
So if you prune them right now,

139
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,889
you're cutting off all
those lovely flower buds.

140
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,759
You wanna wait until
after they're done blooming

141
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,960
in order to prune them.

142
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,829
And the same goes
for early fruiting plants,

143
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,464
because fruit comes
from flowers,

144
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,335
so you don't wanna take off
those flowers.

145
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,503
Pruning is one

146
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,372
of the most frequently
misunderstood practices

147
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,775
directing plant growth.

148
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,911
You need to have
an understanding

149
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,949
of the plant's natural habit
or its natural shape.

150
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,750
You need to know the biology
of the plant,

151
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,187
like when it sets flowers
and fruit.

152
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,522
And finally,
you need to understand

153
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,158
what role is the plant playing
in the environment?

154
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,326
Is it a privacy screen?

155
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,994
Then you don't wanna prune
too aggressively.

156
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,029
You want that nice dense growth.

157
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,464
Is it a specimen plant?

158
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,866
Well, then you want to prune it

159
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,736
to show off its structure
or its flowers.

160
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,072
So moving on
to our pruning equipment

161
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,442
and using the right tools
to make the cut.

162
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,678
It's important to have
the right tool for the job.

163
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,314
This will reduce the chances
of injury to you

164
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,316
and/or to the plant.

165
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,685
You wanna buy the best
equipment that you can afford,

166
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,988
or that you will reasonably use.

167
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,191
Better quality means it'll last
you a long time, theoretically,

168
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,759
but there's no sense going out

169
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,362
and buying an expensive piece
of equipment

170
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,464
for just one landscaping job.

171
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,066
There are lots of tool rentals
available for larger equipment

172
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,968
through your
local hardware stores.

173
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,205
For example, my husband
and I just bought a new house,

174
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:22,309
so I want to rip up my entire
front yard to get rid of grass

175
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:25,379
and just plant it
with other plants.

176
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,915
I'm not gonna buy
a rototiller to do that

177
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,950
because I'm only
gonna need to do it once.

178
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,953
So I'm gonna do a,
I'll rent the equipment

179
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,590
when I'm ready
to tackle this project.

180
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:40,160
Your most common pruning tool is
going to be your hand pruners,

181
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,597
shears, clippers, secateurs,
whatever you wanna call them.

182
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,998
You know what they look like.

183
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,968
I would recommend you get a
very good quality pair of these

184
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,737
because you're gonna be
using them a lot.

185
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,674
They're most frequently used
for annuals,

186
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,542
perennials, and small branches.

187
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,212
You want the stem
to be able to comfortably fit

188
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,413
in the width of the blade,

189
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,049
so that you can make
a nice clean cut.

190
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,784
Anything larger
that you're trying to cut,

191
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,420
you're gonna have a hard time
getting all the way through it,

192
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,923
which can make it harder
for the plant to seal

193
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,592
over a jagged wound.

194
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,527
And you can also risk
damaging your pruners.

195
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,697
Believe me, I have bent blades
trying to cut through.

196
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,433
Just, I'm like, "I can get
this one little water sprout."

197
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,134
No, I bent the blades.

198
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,302
It was a cheaper set.

199
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,471
It wasn't my good pruners,
but still.

200
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,006
There are a
couple different types

201
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,508
of hand pruners you'll see.

202
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,276
The most common type is
the bypass

203
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,547
or scissor action pruners seen
in the top image there.

204
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,750
These can cut cleanly
through live plant material

205
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:40,320
because the blades overlap
right at the end.

206
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,123
The other type is an anvil
or snap cut pruner,

207
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,058
which is used only for dead wood

208
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,161
because the blade comes down
into a little groove.

209
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:52,332
And so as you apply pressure
to a dead woody stem,

210
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,068
it's more likely
to just snap off at that point.

211
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,872
If you try using anvil pruners
on live material,

212
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,875
that live tissue is gonna get
squished down into that groove,

213
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:05,412
and it won't cut
all the way through.

214
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,714
Loppers or two-handed pruners

215
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,083
allow you to cut larger branches
and stems

216
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,420
and give you a little more reach
into dense shrubs

217
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,556
or above head for some branches.

218
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,591
You still wanna be aware
of your blade size,

219
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,359
and make sure
you're cutting stems

220
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,563
that appropriately fit
into the blades.

221
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,998
It's good to look for a pair
of pruners that have bumpers

222
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,401
or a cushioning mechanism
near the blades.

223
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,102
This is a little easier
on the tool

224
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,371
and a little easier
on your joints,

225
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,841
and it's also helpful
to look for a removable bolt

226
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,777
so you can replace the blades
when needed.

227
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,613
These also come in bypass
or anvil type,

228
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,949
and also a ratchet
or gear-driven action,

229
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,419
which snaps into place gradually
as you close the blades.

230
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,855
It can allow you
to cut through tougher wood

231
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:53,026
or larger pieces of wood
with a little bit less effort.

232
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,695
Hand pruning saws, I would say,

233
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,099
is my number two tool
behind your hand pruners.

234
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,602
These allow you to cut
even larger branches,

235
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,770
usually two inches in diameter
or more.

236
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,340
They're easy to maneuver
in tight branch crotches

237
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:10,444
or in shrubs that have lots of
large stems very close together.

238
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:13,080
Some come in a curved design

239
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,249
that's meant to cut
on the pull stroke.

240
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,251
It's a little bit
more ergonomic.

241
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,787
They come either as a static
or non-foldable blade,

242
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,055
seen in the top picture,

243
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,660
or in a foldable design
seen in the middle picture.

244
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,229
And these ones lock into place
when they're fully open,

245
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,431
and then you press the button,
and they lock into place

246
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,467
when they're fully closed.

247
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,669
Make sure this
locking mechanism works

248
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,172
so you don't accidentally
cause injury to yourself

249
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,574
by it opening or closing
when you don't want it to.

250
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:44,211
Again, I'm speaking
from experience.

251
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,814
Some other tools you might
encounter are hedge trimmers.

252
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,584
These are meant
for the very small twiggy stems

253
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,286
and shaping your shrubs.

254
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,888
These can be hand-operated
or powered.

255
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,224
Pole pruners are
kind of like loppers,

256
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,426
but on a much longer pole.

257
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,230
These allow you to reach
branches high up in a canopy.

258
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,065
Again, these can also
be hand-operated

259
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,935
using a little pull rope
or powered.

260
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,837
And finally, your chainsaws.

261
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,739
These are for three inches
or larger diameter branches

262
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,475
and most often used
for large pruning jobs

263
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,579
or the removal of entire trees,
shrubs, limbs,

264
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,980
that sort of thing.

265
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,381
Hopefully not your own limbs.

266
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,583
If you're using a chainsaw,

267
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,785
never use it while
you're standing on a ladder.

268
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,554
It's not a stable base,
and if you have a chainsaw,

269
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,557
consider also buying
a pair of protective chaps

270
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,526
so you don't hurt your legs.

271
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:37,064
You only have two legs,
please protect them.

272
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,498
Maintenance is
an important part

273
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,435
of extending the life
and efficacy of your tools.

274
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,937
Make sure to clean your tools
after every pruning project,

275
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,639
removing any dirt or sap

276
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,075
that could gum up
or dull your blades.

277
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:51,345
Sharpen the blades when needed,
usually once a season.

278
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:55,349
Winter is a great time to sit
down and sharpen your blades.

279
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,318
Oil your blades as needed
to make sure your pruners open

280
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,287
and close smoothly,

281
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,524
and oil them before you
store them for the winter

282
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,459
just to help prevent rusting.

283
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:09,296
Always store in a dry location,
again to avoid rusting,

284
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,165
and replace your blades
if they get any serious nicks,

285
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,368
or if the blades become bent
out of shape.

286
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,570
If there is a nick
or a bend in the blades

287
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,173
that does not allow them
to completely close all the way,

288
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,374
you wanna take care of that.

289
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,243
And a lot of,
a lot of hand pruners,

290
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,280
the companies that produce them
also make replacement blade sets

291
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,015
that you can buy.

292
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:32,219
Sterilization is probably
not going to be an issue

293
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,388
for most of you,
as this is more common

294
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,390
in agricultural
or research practices,

295
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,724
but it can be useful

296
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,194
if you do have a disease concern
with some of your plants.

297
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,729
So bacterial or fungal diseases
will often spread

298
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,565
through plant tissues or saps.

299
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,034
So you want to sterilize
between each plant

300
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,838
that might be a vector
or a source of disease transfer.

301
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,508
You can sterilize using strong
isopropyl or rubbing alcohol

302
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,710
or a 10% bleach solution.

303
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,379
That's one part bleach
to nine parts water.

304
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,282
It's usually enough
to kill any bacteria or virus

305
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,851
that you could be transferring.

306
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,652
If you are using
a bleach solution,

307
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,521
remember to give
your tools just a quick rinse

308
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,122
with regular water afterwards

309
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,426
because bleach
can corrode metal.

310
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,329
So now on to plant anatomy.

311
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,599
I am a plant nerd, and this is
where my love for plants is

312
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,200
is in how they grow

313
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,903
and looking at the
inner workings of them.

314
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,239
But we need to know
plant anatomy and understanding

315
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,343
how our plants grow so that
we prune them appropriately.

316
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,978
So starting off very basic,

317
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,646
there are two types
of plant growth.

318
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,881
There's primary growth,

319
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:38,085
which is your green,
herbaceous, soft, tender growth.

320
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,388
It's usually growth
in length or height of a plant

321
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,757
and is growth
from the shoot tips.

322
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,227
This usually occurs in the first
growing season for a plant,

323
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,595
so plants such as annuals

324
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,531
that only have the
one growing season

325
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:55,002
are likely going to be
this tender herbaceous growth.

326
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,304
Then we have secondary
or woody growth.

327
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,641
So this is when the plant starts
to produce wood.

328
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,276
This is associated with growth

329
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,811
in the diameter or width
of the stems.

330
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,915
This always occurs
after the primary growth.

331
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,583
Biennials and perennials,

332
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,385
plants with more than one
growing season,

333
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:15,355
can exhibit
this secondary woody growth.

334
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,091
Now, I'm not gonna test you
on this portion.

335
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,093
This is just to point out
a couple of things.

336
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,095
The only parts I want you
to pay attention to

337
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,263
are the buds.

338
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,465
At the end of a stem,
we have our terminal bud.

339
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,668
Sometimes there can be
more than one,

340
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:31,338
and any bud below that
is a lateral or axial bud.

341
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:32,673
Two names mean the same thing,

342
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,410
so any bud below the
terminal bud is a lateral bud.

343
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,979
There are also bud scale scars.

344
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,348
So it's kind of a row
of those little lines.

345
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,250
And that's just
where the terminal bud

346
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:46,787
from the previous
growth season was.

347
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:50,023
And so looking at the space
between that bud scale scar

348
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,892
and the one before shows you

349
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,728
how much growth occurred
in that season

350
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,698
or the terminal bud
and the last bud scale scar.

351
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:03,303
That's how much growth occurred
in your last growing season.

352
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,405
Bud arrangement just tells you

353
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,308
how buds are sitting
on the stem.

354
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,811
Opposite arrangement means
they're sitting directly across

355
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,145
from each other,

356
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,648
and alternate arrangement
means they alternate which side

357
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,618
of the stem they're sitting on.

358
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,488
This also will reflect what the
resulting growth will look like.

359
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,056
So if these buds start to grow,

360
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:27,427
those branches will then
be opposite or alternate.

361
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,663
Apical control
and apical dominance

362
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,366
are just functions
directing how a plant grows.

363
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,802
Both are terms for how
upward growth, terminal growth,

364
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:40,174
will stop lateral, or outward
growth, from occurring.

365
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,109
If apical dominance is broken,

366
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:45,445
it will signal the lateral buds
below it to start growing.

367
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,582
So you cut off the top, and
the lateral side buds will grow.

368
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,217
It'll get a little bushier.

369
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,719
If apical control is broken,

370
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,855
the lateral stems
will try to take the place

371
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,023
of the main leader.

372
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,291
So instead of growing outwards,

373
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:01,562
they're gonna kind of
change direction and go upwards.

374
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,697
The plant's form
will be noticeably altered

375
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:06,099
if the plant exhibits
apical control

376
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,301
and you break that main leader.

377
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,236
It's just gonna look different
afterwards.

378
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,171
It can't really get
that original look back.

379
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,942
This is common with things
like evergreen trees.

380
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,510
So how do trees grow?

381
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:17,911
This is just
a fun little picture.

382
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,513
It's not the same tree
in both pictures,

383
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,381
but it is a fig tree.

384
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,417
So how does this tree start out?

385
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,486
Every branch starts out
as a bud.

386
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:30,057
Branches then grow outwards
and increase in diameter

387
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,658
along with the trunk

388
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,895
as year to year,
they grow these woody layers.

389
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:38,198
So, the branch wood
is locked inside the trunk wood

390
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,034
because these layers overlap.

391
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,837
So you get a layer of branch
wood and a layer of trunk wood.

392
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:45,439
And so they overlap
as they get bigger,

393
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,308
and that locks the branch
nice and secure

394
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,676
to the rest of the trunk.

395
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,279
It's not like you had a clay
model, and you had a trunk,

396
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,382
and you just stick
your little branch on the side.

397
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,618
As these layers overlap,

398
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,387
it creates a little area
called the branch collar,

399
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,923
or where the wood
is just slightly more swollen

400
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,892
right before that branch
meets the trunk.

401
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,929
And this is an important feature
when it comes to pruning.

402
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,765
How do we know
if a branch is strong?

403
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,600
Branch diameter should always be

404
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,170
less than half
of trunk diameter.

405
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,504
Anything more than that

406
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,239
and we get into something
called codominance.

407
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,441
So I'll get to that
in just a little bit.

408
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,210
But we wanna look for a branch

409
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:27,681
that is less than half
of the trunk's diameter.

410
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,184
Strong branches
also should just occur

411
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,186
at one location on a trunk.

412
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,787
You shouldn't have
multiple branches

413
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,857
kind of all at the same height
or right next to each other,

414
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:39,393
because as they get larger
and increase in size,

415
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,228
they're gonna start
to rub against each other

416
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:46,834
and cause wounding, which could
then cause some wood decay.

417
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,170
However, you wanna picture how
these branches are gonna grow

418
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,471
as they get older.

419
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,474
This is a healthy branch
attachment on this white pine,

420
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,410
because as the trunk
increases in size

421
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,345
and as these branches
increase in size,

422
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,580
they're so spread out

423
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,849
that they're never gonna
interfere with each other.

424
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,750
So this is an example

425
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,254
where there are more
than one branch at one spot,

426
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:12,226
but they're still healthily
and strongly attached.

427
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,362
So, codominant stems
are when a trunk

428
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,334
becomes two or more branches or
trunks of about the same size.

429
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,203
This leads to a forking
or a "Y" shape.

430
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,006
And this creates a weak union
between the branches,

431
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:28,709
because instead of the
smaller stem interlocking

432
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,711
with the bark
of the larger stem,

433
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,813
they're gonna continue
to grow separately

434
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,350
and without that
interlocking support.

435
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,018
This can become a problem,

436
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,221
because those areas
where they don't quite overlap

437
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,156
can allow water and microbes

438
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,526
to get inside
and start to decay the wood,

439
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,894
and worst-case scenario,

440
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,097
this could lead to the entire
trunk splitting in half,

441
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,834
which is a death sentence
for this tree.

442
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:58,605
So, codominance can include,
can mean you have included bark.

443
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,674
So as these two stems
grow separately,

444
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,476
their bark
is gonna kind of get trapped

445
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,178
in between the two of them.

446
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,481
It won't somehow
magically merge together.

447
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,183
And like I mentioned earlier,

448
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,218
that included bark
can leave space

449
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,887
for water or bacteria or fungi

450
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,924
to get in there
and start to decay the wood.

451
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,259
Alternatively,
we can have excluded bark,

452
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,661
which is where the bark

453
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,763
is pushing out
and away from the trunk.

454
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,298
This is what
will naturally happen

455
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,466
when we do get
those overlapping layers

456
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,303
and the bark continues to grow
on that outer layer,

457
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,938
and it just pushes outwards.

458
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,973
So you can usually see
the difference.

459
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,375
It might be more subtle
depending on some trees,

460
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,945
but you can see where
that bark is pushing outwards.

461
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:42,015
And that's healthy
for branch attachment.

462
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,884
Water sprouts and suckers,

463
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,786
otherwise known
as epicormic growth.

464
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,688
So, you'll usually see these
on trees.

465
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,690
They're just, some trees do this

466
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,625
because they're
more aggressive growers.

467
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:55,095
And sometimes they can do this
in response to stress,

468
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,831
not having enough water
or something like that.

469
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,433
But what they are
are vertical shoots

470
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,335
formed from stems or branches,

471
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,136
in which case
they're water sprouts,

472
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,239
or formed
from the base of the plant,

473
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,241
in which case they are suckers.

474
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,576
These stems
are always weakly attached.

475
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,278
Because they grow so vertically,

476
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,547
it's hard to get
those overlapping layers.

477
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:17,618
They can become stronger
with time and proper care,

478
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:22,589
but you can also just prune them
away any time of year.

479
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,628
So, what do we wanna look for
for developing a strong tree

480
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,198
or seeing if a tree
has a strong foundation?

481
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:34,334
So, our first characteristic
for maximum stability in a tree

482
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,004
is that the tree
has a single main leader.

483
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,472
It only has one trunk

484
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,641
running the majority of the way
through the plant.

485
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,376
Once it gets
to the very top canopy,

486
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,911
it can kind of split
and diverge,

487
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,412
and you won't notice it as much.

488
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,081
But as long as it's at least
three-quarters of the way

489
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,249
through the whole plant,

490
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:52,319
you're gonna have
a strong base.

491
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:58,525
You wanna look for root flare
at the base of a tree.

492
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,961
So this means
the roots have spread out

493
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:04,464
and formed a really nice
foundation and they,

494
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,500
they're really gripping
the ground for that tree

495
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,703
to hold steady
in weather events.

496
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:14,408
What can happen if the tree
doesn't have a strong root flare

497
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,742
is in planting,

498
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,545
if it's planted too deep
or covered with too much mulch,

499
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,581
these roots
are trying to find oxygen.

500
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,951
They're really important for
oxygen exchange for the plant.

501
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,819
And so as they're covered,

502
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:28,689
they're gonna circle
around the base of the tree

503
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,692
and cause what we call girdling.

504
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,660
So this is when the roots
are circling around.

505
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,529
It can happen
because the plant wasn't,

506
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:37,698
or the tree
wasn't planted properly.

507
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,367
And these girdling roots
can kind of suffocate that tree

508
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:42,903
as it tries to grow larger.

509
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,273
The next thing
we wanna look for

510
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,108
for stability is trunk taper.

511
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,910
This just means
that the caliper,

512
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,479
or width of the trunk,
is larger at the base

513
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,449
and decreases
as you move upward.

514
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:59,620
A proper taper develops from a
tree having enough time to grow

515
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,322
and being able to move
back and forth in the wind

516
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,324
when it's younger
so it can kind of build up

517
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:07,561
these woody layers at the base
to strengthen it.

518
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:10,264
So something like trees
in a dense forest canopy,

519
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,999
they're gonna grow
really quickly

520
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,067
to try and reach that sunlight,

521
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:16,703
and so their resulting wood
can be weaker.

522
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,473
They don't have as strong
of a trunk taper.

523
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,341
Another thing
that can weaken trunk taper

524
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,644
is leaving your tree staked
for too long.

525
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,347
You only wanna leave them
about a year, maybe two years.

526
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,716
After that, you wanna
take away those stakes

527
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,718
and let the tree move around
in the breeze,

528
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,420
let it develop that trunk taper

529
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:37,157
so that it can be strong
into the future.

530
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:41,161
And the last thing we look for
for maximum tree stability

531
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:43,230
is making sure
our branches are scaffolded,

532
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:44,965
or evenly distributed.

533
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,967
This occurs
both in the vertical aspect,

534
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,102
so as you're moving
from the base to the top,

535
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:50,871
and in a radial aspect,

536
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,473
so if you were looking top-down
or bottom-up,

537
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,844
making sure branches are evenly
spaced all the way around.

538
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,445
This is also
what we're looking for

539
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:00,314
when we're talking about
that branch attachment

540
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,282
and making sure that not
too many branches

541
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,251
are clustered in one spot,

542
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:09,790
because this can mean the weight
is unevenly distributed.

543
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:13,227
If the weight
is unevenly distributed,

544
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:15,162
the tree could be more prone
to splitting

545
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,431
or leaning to a specific side.

546
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,599
The picture on the right

547
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,267
shows a tree
that has been lion's-tailed,

548
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,436
which is an outdated
pruning practice

549
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:25,239
where all of the interior
branches are taken off,

550
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,974
leaving only leaves at, like,

551
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,542
kind of the tips
of the branches,

552
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,879
which puts the weight only out
on those tips of the branches,

553
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,615
and so those branches split.

554
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:37,017
And, again, scaffolding
is a structural feature

555
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,620
that you wanna establish
really early in the tree's life

556
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,255
and continue to maintain it,

557
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,789
because it's much harder
to fix later.

558
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,759
So the picture on the left here,
it's gonna be really hard

559
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,794
to fix
that uneven weight distribution.

560
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,963
You're kind of just
gonna have to let it be

561
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,432
or wait until you're ready
to take off that whole limb

562
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,635
or take the tree down.

563
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,670
So, a quick little example.

564
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,071
Do we have a strong main leader?

565
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,806
Just a yes or no.

566
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:05,279
Yes, this tree has a very clear
leader directing its growth.

567
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:07,548
How about root flare?

568
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,349
Yep,
this tree has good root flare.

569
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,485
I like this example,
because it's very easy to see.

570
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:14,254
Sometimes it can be
a little more subtle.

571
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:16,456
How about trunk taper?

572
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,260
Yes, again,
a little harder to see,

573
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:23,030
but the width, or the width
of the base of the tree

574
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,631
is wider than further up.

575
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:26,500
This tree is not surrounded
by anything else.

576
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,803
It had a lot of time
to grow at its own pace, per se.

577
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,841
And finally, what about
our branch scaffolding?

578
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,877
Yeah, this tree has really good
branch scaffolding.

579
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:39,413
There may be spots where it's
a little bit less thin.

580
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,849
And, of course, there's leaves
over it, so you can't see.

581
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:45,919
But the overall shape of that
tree's crown, or leaf canopy,

582
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,120
is very even.

583
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:51,191
So it's not leaning
too heavily to one side.

584
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:54,194
All right, and now we'll get
into tree injury

585
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,863
and compartmentalization.

586
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,664
And a fun little saying
I have here

587
00:24:57,731 --> 00:25:00,067
is animals heal, trees seal.

588
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,835
And that grows for other plants
as well.

589
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,704
They can only seal.

590
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,808
So, pruning inherently causes
a wound to a plant.

591
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,143
It's important to know how
plants deal with these wounds,

592
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,412
especially for such
longer-lived organisms

593
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,780
like trees.

594
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,183
So that's where we're gonna
focus on it for a little bit.

595
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,319
Trees are some of the largest
and longest-lived organisms

596
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:20,821
that we know of.

597
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:25,092
Despite this, they don't have
any wound-healing process.

598
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:29,263
They can't take damaged tissue
and make it function again.

599
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,732
They can only seal off
these damaged areas

600
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,668
and then grow new,
functioning tissue around it.

601
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:38,172
So an example of this are when
wildfires leave scars on--

602
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:41,408
that are visible in tree rings
even hundreds of years later.

603
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,544
And this is an important part
of dendrochronology,

604
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,847
or dating things
using tree rings.

605
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,616
So, how does a tree do this?

606
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,952
Well, they have a process
of creating boundaries

607
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:55,756
around an injury
both horizontally, radially,

608
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,191
and vertically inside the trunk.

609
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,159
So every direction
that something could go,

610
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:02,663
the tree has a way
to block that pathway off.

611
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,399
This helps resist the loss
of normal wood function,

612
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:08,468
which is strength and
transporting water or nutrients,

613
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,071
and helps resist the spread
of bacteria and fungi

614
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:12,906
that can cause decay.

615
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:16,076
The tree will then grow
new wood around this area

616
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:19,079
and eventually close over
the top of these boundaries.

617
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,248
This process is called CODIT,

618
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:24,117
or compartmentalization of decay
in trees,

619
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:28,655
coined by Alex Shigo
of the USDA Forest Service.

620
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:33,327
One specific zone that can form
is in the base of a branch,

621
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,529
we have what's called
the branch protection zone.

622
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,131
This area has more chemicals
in the wood

623
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:41,134
that resist microorganisms
from spreading.

624
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:43,604
So what this does functionally

625
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,507
is if a branch is injured
and starts to decay,

626
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:50,277
it can decay down into that
where that branch wood is.

627
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,979
But because we have
that separation

628
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:53,514
with the branch protection zone

629
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,182
and the layers
of the trunk wood,

630
00:26:55,249 --> 00:27:00,053
that can stop that decay
from moving into the trunk.

631
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:04,324
This can also work, so,
it can work in two directions.

632
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:08,228
It can also work where the
center of the trunk is decayed

633
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,830
and starts to hollow out.

634
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,665
But you can see
in that upper picture

635
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,967
that that's where the base
of the branches are.

636
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:17,037
That's where
that branch protection zone is.

637
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,806
This is why
it's really, really important

638
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,642
not to harm the branch collar

639
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:26,446
or those overlapping layers when
you're making your pruning cuts.

640
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:28,048
And speaking of making
pruning cuts,

641
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:30,784
how do we,
how do we actually do it?

642
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,786
Well, we have two types of cuts
that we use.

643
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,755
The first is a thinning cut.

644
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,357
And a thinning cut is used
to take off a lateral branch

645
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:39,126
where it joins a larger branch

646
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:41,862
or where it joins the trunk
of the plant.

647
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:47,201
And this then directs the growth
to that other main branch.

648
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,569
And then, there's a heading cut,

649
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:51,038
which interrupts
that growth pattern

650
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:55,008
and often induces
other branches to grow.

651
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,878
So, for heading cuts,

652
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:02,149
growth is localized
to each specific stem.

653
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,151
It can force lateral buds,

654
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:06,653
or those lower-down buds
from the terminal buds,

655
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,856
to grow on most plants.

656
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:13,060
It results in very lush
and vigorous growth.

657
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:16,830
But those new stems
might be weakly attached.

658
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,966
They tend to have
that very vertical growth,

659
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,703
kind of like water sprouts
and suckers.

660
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,438
Heading cuts are good

661
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,473
for increasing
the fullness of your shrub.

662
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,442
So instead of having one stem,

663
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:31,044
or in the picture,
instead of having six stems,

664
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,046
when you cut it, then it has 12,

665
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,716
and it's gonna increase
exponentially like that.

666
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:38,819
So it increases
the fullness of that shrub.

667
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,121
So you wanna use heading cuts
when you're shearing.

668
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,923
It's inherently
what you're doing.

669
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,391
You can also use heading cuts

670
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,227
to force buds
at specific locations.

671
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:49,730
And it's useful
on smaller branches.

672
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:52,332
We're talking finger thickness
or less.

673
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,268
The larger the stem diameter,

674
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,137
the more aggressively this plant
is gonna sprout out

675
00:28:57,204 --> 00:29:00,507
from the area
that you made the cut.

676
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,042
You can also use heading cuts

677
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:04,745
for rejuvenation
of certain shrubs.

678
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:07,814
And rejuvenation is when you cut
all of the stems off.

679
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:10,217
You cut everything down
and start over.

680
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:13,820
Which you do need to do
for some plants on occasion.

681
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,322
And heading cuts can be used

682
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,157
to increase flower production
on plants

683
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:20,160
that produce their flowers
at those terminal tips.

684
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:22,029
So instead of having one stem,

685
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,064
if you cut it off
and get two or three,

686
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,300
well, that's two or three
more flower buds

687
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:28,702
than you had previously.

688
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,805
So when we're actually making
a heading cut,

689
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:35,309
you wanna cut slightly
above a bud or set of buds.

690
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,810
If you leave it too high,

691
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:40,814
the chunk left behind
until you get to those buds

692
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,182
is gonna decay,

693
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,018
and that decay could possibly
move further down the stem.

694
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,288
Cut it too low, and you could
accidentally harm these buds,

695
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:50,424
and then the growth
is gonna have to revert back

696
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,792
to the next set down,

697
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,461
and you'll end up
with the first problem.

698
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:57,497
For alternate bud arrangement,
you wanna go just above a bud

699
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,633
and cut at about
a 45-degree angle.

700
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,603
This just allows water
to roll off that stem.

701
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:03,904
And for opposite-bud
arrangement,

702
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,472
you wanna go
just above the buds

703
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,242
and then
just cut straight across.

704
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,577
Please, please,
please, please, please

705
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,914
don't use heading cuts
on trees or tree topping.

706
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,215
This is when you go through

707
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:18,151
and remove the tops
of the entire...

708
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:20,220
All the way across the tree,
the branches and trunks,

709
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:22,489
you're taking the top
of everything off.

710
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:25,759
You're gonna have that really
vertical growth afterwards.

711
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,195
So, our consequence of this,

712
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,030
we don't have
any branch protection zone

713
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,532
to protect our tree,

714
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:35,536
so the branches and trunk could
possibly start to rot away.

715
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:37,905
It's very much
going to stress out the tree.

716
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:40,207
You're taking away
a lot of its energy,

717
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,876
and you're, it's gonna cause
a lot of new growth,

718
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:45,979
which also takes energy until
it can get those leaves back.

719
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,582
And it will ruin
the natural form of this tree.

720
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:53,120
The tree will never recover
its original shape.

721
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:57,925
So we have very poor growth
resulting from this.

722
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:00,227
And this new growth
is prone to breakage,

723
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:03,463
especially
if it's left to get larger.

724
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,866
So if it gets larger and heavier
and then it breaks off,

725
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:11,271
now it's a safety hazard in
addition to being really ugly.

726
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:14,908
Thinning cuts are when we remove
a branch back to a larger branch

727
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:17,544
or back to the trunk itself.

728
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,346
What happens when we do this?

729
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:21,348
It means the growth effect
is distributed

730
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:22,516
over the entire plant.

731
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,218
We are just redirecting
that growth.

732
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:27,187
We're not causing the plant
to grow new stems

733
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,923
that it wouldn't previously.

734
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,126
It keeps
the same growth pattern.

735
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:40,501
A proper thinning cut happens
just outside the branch collar.

736
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,970
We don't wanna hurt
that branch collar.

737
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:46,507
And this is in contrast
to a flush cut,

738
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:50,477
which is where you would cut
perpendicular, or parallel,

739
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,479
excuse me,
parallel to the trunk.

740
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:53,947
And what happens
when you do this

741
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:56,617
is you destroy
your branch protection zone.

742
00:31:56,683 --> 00:32:00,053
It's a larger area that
the plant needs to seal over.

743
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,856
And remember, things like trees,
they grow pretty slowly.

744
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,392
So you wanna cause
the smallest wound that you can

745
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:08,362
so that it can seal over quicker

746
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,899
and you have no barrier between
the branch wood and trunk wood.

747
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:14,301
So if this decay
that's starting to happen,

748
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:18,138
it will inevitably happen
with wood,

749
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,940
that can then start
to move down the trunk.

750
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:23,343
And in a matter of years,
possibly decades,

751
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,345
it could compromise
the entire tree.

752
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:26,880
Again, it's not gonna happen
right away,

753
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,749
but it's not a good,

754
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:33,887
you're not giving that tree
any help into its life.

755
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,355
And this is just another diagram

756
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:37,291
of cutting
outside the branch collar.

757
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:39,059
And it's also demonstrating
a three-point cut,

758
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,629
which is what
we're gonna talk about next.

759
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,198
So, what a three-point cut does,

760
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:46,767
it's a method
for cutting larger branches

761
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:50,003
that prevent them
from tearing into the bark

762
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,173
and possibly
tearing into the branch collar

763
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,975
and branch protection zone.

764
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:58,245
So this area of torn wood
is susceptible to decay

765
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,948
and will take much longer
for the tree to seal over.

766
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:05,085
Again, that's a much larger area
that's now exposed.

767
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,654
And do you see what else
is wrong with this picture?

768
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:09,289
They also made a flush cut.

769
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:12,559
So they made a flush cut,
which already wasn't good,

770
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:15,329
and then the branch
tore the bark further down.

771
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,130
So that's gonna be
a really hard wound

772
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:20,234
for that tree
to try and seal over.

773
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,202
What we do
with the three-point cut

774
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:24,137
is wherever you want
your final cut to be,

775
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:26,073
you're gonna move
a few inches out.

776
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,842
And I would say, you know,
the further the distance

777
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:31,044
for however big
the branch is gonna be.

778
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:34,014
If it's a small branch,
maybe just four to six inches.

779
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:37,351
But your first cut is going
to be a few inches away

780
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,119
from where
you want your final cut.

781
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,921
And you're gonna cut
from the bottom up.

782
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,489
You're gonna start
at the bottom.

783
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,491
And what this does
is relieves the weight

784
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,260
of the rest of that branch,

785
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:49,029
preventing it
from tearing backwards.

786
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:51,598
And what happens is you'll
usually know your saw getting,

787
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:54,168
notice your saw
getting pinched in the wood.

788
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,435
It'll get harder to move it,

789
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:58,805
because that weight
is shifting down onto it.

790
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,108
Your second cut
is to go just outside

791
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:03,544
or just a little bit further out
from your first one,

792
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,280
and just cut downwards until
you cut all the way through

793
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:09,416
or until the branch
naturally snaps off.

794
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:10,584
So instead of tearing,

795
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:12,186
it's just gonna snap
at this one spot,

796
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:13,921
and then it'll fall off.

797
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:16,557
This relieves the weight
of all the rest of that branch,

798
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,625
leaving you free
to make your third cut,

799
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,929
which is where you want
your final cut to be initially.

800
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:24,464
And you only have to deal
with this little stub,

801
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,466
so it's not as much weight
you're trying to wrangle

802
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,668
when you're making
your final cut.

803
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:28,936
It can be very clean,

804
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:31,572
which it, makes it easier
for the plant to seal over.

805
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,440
And when you do
this process right

806
00:34:33,507 --> 00:34:38,312
and it snaps off perfectly,
oh, it's so satisfying.

807
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,483
So, plant growth patterns
and pruning.

808
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,719
First of all,
when you're pruning anything,

809
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:47,821
you wanna prune in small doses.

810
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:50,023
Take off a few pieces,
step back,

811
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,693
get the larger picture,
and then go back in for more.

812
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:57,364
You can't put anything back on
once you take it off.

813
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,967
When we're pruning, we always
wanna remove the three Ds:

814
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:03,504
any dead, damaged,
or diseased parts of the plant

815
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,207
that could impact
how it's growing in the future.

816
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:10,410
We also wanna remove any
crossing or rubbing branches,

817
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:12,546
because these
are gonna cause damage

818
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:14,848
and possibly decay
in the future.

819
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:18,685
And we can remove
any water sprouts or suckers.

820
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,354
And this is just
a little diagram

821
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,755
of what you can be looking for

822
00:35:21,822 --> 00:35:25,292
when you're looking
at a tree canopy.

823
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:28,795
So, we have three
different plant growth types,

824
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:32,599
and each one is gonna affect
how we want to prune that plant.

825
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:37,738
So, our first type is terminal
growers, like most trees.

826
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:39,606
Our second is basal growers,

827
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:42,109
which covers
most of your shrubs.

828
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,144
And finally,
we have intermediate growers,

829
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:46,046
which are partly
like basal growers

830
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:47,648
and partly like
terminal growers.

831
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:49,783
So you can prune them
in either direction,

832
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,153
depending on what you want
the plant to look like.

833
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,556
So, for our terminal growers,
most trees,

834
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:57,791
these usually have
a single trunk.

835
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:58,959
They might have a couple,

836
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,494
but usually they have
a single trunk.

837
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:03,330
Their largest buds
will be at their terminal tips,

838
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,165
and their growth
is most prolific

839
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:08,802
from those terminal tips
of the stems.

840
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,738
Most pruning work
starts at a young age.

841
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:16,443
And again, almost all trees
are terminal growers.

842
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,447
So, our steps to pruning these,
first, remove your three Ds:

843
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:23,116
any dead, damaged,
or diseased wood.

844
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,385
Then you wanna remove
any wrongly placed,

845
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,287
interfering, or rubbing limbs.

846
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,455
So these are things

847
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,057
that might be pointing
in the wrong direction.

848
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:32,392
They might be rubbing
against each other

849
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,695
or going to rub into each other

850
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:38,065
when they get
a little bit bigger.

851
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,433
Then you can prune to shape,

852
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:41,602
establishing your
good scaffolding,

853
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:44,071
making sure branches
are evenly spaced.

854
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:45,339
You're gonna kind of imagine

855
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:48,141
what this plant is gonna
look like as it gets bigger.

856
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,410
You only wanna use
proper thinning cuts,

857
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,046
taking every stem back
to a larger branch

858
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,716
or back to the trunk itself.

859
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:58,986
And in general, don't prune
more than a quarter to a third

860
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,388
of the total branches
on the tree

861
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:03,190
or you're gonna start
stressing it out.

862
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:06,026
Pruning removes the leaves
for that plant,

863
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:07,895
which leaves generate energy.

864
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:10,397
So taking away too much of that,
and in addition,

865
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:13,033
the plant having to spend energy
to recover,

866
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,868
you don't wanna take off
more than a third

867
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:18,972
of everything that's there
or you stress your plant out.

868
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,341
Our basal growers,
so most shrubs,

869
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:25,112
they have multiple trunks
or stems from the base.

870
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,980
They usually have
their largest buds

871
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:29,449
on the more middle portions
of the stem,

872
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:31,418
and they flower
on these more middle

873
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:34,488
or lateral portions of the stem.

874
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:39,259
We usually prune our shrubs
to enhance blooming or fruiting,

875
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:42,496
and we can also prune to keep
them from getting too crowded.

876
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:44,331
If they get too crowded
at the base,

877
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:46,433
the stems could, again,
rub against each other,

878
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,736
or you could get some leaves
and other material down in there

879
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:51,171
that starts to cause decay,

880
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,806
which could, you know,
make it harder

881
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:55,642
for the plant
to repel that decay.

882
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:59,613
Common basal growers include
<i>Forsythia,</i> boxwood, spireas,

883
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,415
any shrub that has a lot
of stems

884
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:03,984
that come out from the base.

885
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,853
Our pruning steps
for basal growers,

886
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,988
again, start with the three Ds.

887
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,189
Then we wanna remove

888
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:11,692
one-third of the oldest stems
at ground level.

889
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:13,527
Not one-third of all the stems,

890
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:16,697
just a third
of the oldest, largest stems.

891
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:18,899
This helps thin out the base
of that plant

892
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:23,770
and make space for those
smaller stems to grow bigger.

893
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:26,807
Then you wanna stand back
and cut any unappealing stems.

894
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:30,110
So if you have one
that's way taller than the rest,

895
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,112
go ahead and go in
and take that one out.

896
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,914
If you have one that's growing
a weird direction

897
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,083
or had some damage,
so it's growing one way,

898
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,684
and then it starts growing
a different way,

899
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,086
you can take those out.

900
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,655
You just continue thinning
things out in a random pattern

901
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,457
until, again,
a quarter to a third

902
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:46,193
of all the stems are removed.

903
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,162
Shearing works well
with basal growers

904
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,899
because we have those flowers
all along the stems

905
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,634
and not just at the ends,

906
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,538
so your heading cuts won't
remove all of these flowers.

907
00:38:57,604 --> 00:39:01,241
Shearing shrubs can increase
the "twigginess," or fullness.

908
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:02,943
It will still remove
some of the flowers,

909
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,945
but you're gonna have
a lot left behind.

910
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,782
It will, however, cause the
shrub to lose its natural form.

911
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,152
Usually, we are shearing a shrub
into a specific form.

912
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:16,823
You can get this back over time,
but it's gonna take some work.

913
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,393
And additionally, causing
a lot of little pruning wounds

914
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:20,694
all over the plant

915
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:24,231
could potentially make it
more insect- and disease-prone.

916
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:26,166
It's usually
not gonna be an issue,

917
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,135
but it is something
to factor into account.

918
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,971
And finally, shearing
is very labor-intensive.

919
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,473
You have to do this
multiple times a growing season.

920
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,342
So if you're paying someone else
to do this,

921
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,144
you're gonna have to pay them
a lot more

922
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,679
to do something like this.

923
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,881
And also,
it's more work for you,

924
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:43,116
and I don't think it results
in a very good-looking plant.

925
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:45,752
I would much rather have
the plant in that top picture

926
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:47,454
that looks nice and natural.

927
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,956
It's the same plant
in both pictures,

928
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,491
just not in the same place.

929
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:54,027
And finally, we have
our intermediate growers.

930
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:57,764
So growth for these is partly
terminal and partly basal.

931
00:39:57,831 --> 00:39:59,867
They can have multiple stems
at the base,

932
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:02,035
but they also tend to have
their largest buds

933
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:04,104
at the terminal tips.

934
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:09,042
So we wanna prune these to
enhance flowering and fruiting.

935
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:11,311
We prune to keep
a specific form,

936
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:13,680
so you can either
keep them more as a shrub

937
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,482
or keep them more as a tree,

938
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,217
depending on
how you want to prune them.

939
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:20,687
And common examples of this
are our lilacs, <i>Rhododendrons,</i>

940
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,324
some <i>Viburnum</i>
and <i>Hydrangea</i> species.

941
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:25,792
And how we prune these,

942
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,295
again,
starting with the three Ds.

943
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:29,796
And then, for our second step,

944
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,965
you wanna decide
what shape you want.

945
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,901
If you want a basal shape,

946
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:37,838
you're going to take out
a third of the oldest branches

947
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:41,008
to leave the rest to grow
and leave it nice and bushy.

948
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:43,177
Or you want to remove all stems

949
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:46,480
except your main leader
or a couple main leaders,

950
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:48,048
like you see
with some lilac trees.

951
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,983
They might have
two or three main stems,

952
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,418
but everything
smaller than that

953
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:54,521
coming from the base,
you wanna remove.

954
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:55,989
You can use heading cuts

955
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:59,359
to force branching
in certain areas.

956
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,361
So if it's maybe
a little lopsided,

957
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:03,130
you can go through,
make a little cut

958
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:07,568
to cause it to push out a
couple stems and rebalance out.

959
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,504
You can also use heading cuts to
remove old seed and fruit heads.

960
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:13,774
Because these have such larger
flower heads at the ends,

961
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,776
we can go through
and take those flower heads off

962
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:17,444
when they're done blooming.

963
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,012
And finally,
use your thinning cuts

964
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,216
to remove any unappealing stems.

965
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:27,354
Vining plants can also be pruned
like intermediate growers.

966
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:30,591
It really depends
on what the plant is.

967
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:33,894
So you might need to do your
research into specific vines,

968
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:36,063
when they flower,
that sort of thing.

969
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:37,898
They can be
a lot more complicated.

970
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:40,901
It's more personal per plant.

971
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,403
And finally, we can do
a rejuvenation pruning.

972
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,273
So, this works on some shrubs.

973
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,977
And what happens is we cut a
plant completely to the ground.

974
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:52,112
We use heading cuts
all over the plant.

975
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,081
This is useful
for multi-stem shrubs

976
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:55,749
that haven't been pruned
for years.

977
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,985
They might be overgrown, leggy.

978
00:41:58,051 --> 00:42:00,921
They're not flowering
or not showing their bark color.

979
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:04,591
Common example is your red-osier
dogwood, or red-stemmed dogwood.

980
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,727
The red is brightest
on those young,

981
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:10,264
on the youngest stems,
and they get darker over time.

982
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,900
So, on occasion,
you might just decide,

983
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:14,935
"Hey, it's kind of tall
and leggy.

984
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:16,336
"I just wanna cut 'em all off

985
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:19,540
and get a bunch of those bright,
new, fresh stems."

986
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:21,341
I wouldn't recommend
doing that every year,

987
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:24,545
but you can do it
every couple years.

988
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:25,946
Rejuvenation pruning works

989
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:27,915
on these basal
or intermediate growers.

990
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:30,083
It does not work
with all plants.

991
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,019
Please do your research
before you do this

992
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,121
so you don't accidentally
cut everything down,

993
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:39,193
and then you're left going,
"Oh, no, what now?" [laughs]

994
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,562
For pruning annuals,
you're most commonly

995
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,697
just gonna be deadheading
and that sort of thing.

996
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:45,432
Deadheading means to cut off

997
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,634
spent flower heads
or flower stalks,

998
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,004
usually to prevent fruiting
or seed formation,

999
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,506
because that takes
a lot of energy.

1000
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:55,342
So if the plant is directing
all its energy to making seeds,

1001
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,678
it's not gonna be making
as many flowers.

1002
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,680
So you can save the plant
some energy.

1003
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:02,482
And also, when you take off
those parts

1004
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,318
where it's trying to form seed,

1005
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:08,155
the plant can recognize,
"Hey, I didn't make my seeds.

1006
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:10,557
Let me send out more flowers
so I can make my seeds."

1007
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:13,560
Because that's what
they want to do.

1008
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,796
You can also cut back annuals,

1009
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:19,333
so clearing or cutting away most
or all of dead plant material

1010
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:21,435
in the fall, winter, or spring.

1011
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:24,471
You can do this for annuals
or herbaceous perennials.

1012
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:27,808
However, removing green leaves,
even if they're mostly dead,

1013
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:31,011
that's still some extra energy
the plant is getting back.

1014
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:32,179
So I would recommend waiting

1015
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,748
until all of the leaves
are completely withered,

1016
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:39,219
or wait until spring
to do your spring cleaning.

1017
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,622
Additionally, slow down
on your spring cleaning.

1018
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:42,990
Don't do this beforehand.

1019
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:44,558
Because leaving that,

1020
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,426
those leaves
and dead plant material

1021
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:47,594
can provide habitat

1022
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:49,630
for our native invertebrates
and pollinators.

1023
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,199
It helps give your plants
some extra insulation

1024
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,535
against our really harsh
winter temperatures.

1025
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,436
And it's a good
natural fertilizer.

1026
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,772
Leaves are
nature's best fertilizer.

1027
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,507
So wait to clean out
your plant material

1028
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:03,277
until the insects are up
and about in the spring,

1029
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:05,579
and then you can remove things.

1030
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,781
Leaving wet, decaying material

1031
00:44:07,848 --> 00:44:10,584
can cause disease pressure
for a plant.

1032
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,852
So once it starts growing,

1033
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:13,453
then you can clear out
some of that

1034
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,657
and just give it a little bit
of an easier time.

1035
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,559
And our last section,
pruning conifers.

1036
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,361
So, they have a little bit
different pruning needs.

1037
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:22,829
They can be
a little more tricky.

1038
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:25,332
Most conifers grow best
in full sun.

1039
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:28,635
When the conifers become shaded,
the foliage dies.

1040
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:30,204
So things like arborvitaes,

1041
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,839
if you look
into the center of them,

1042
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:34,041
there's no green leaves
in the middle.

1043
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:35,976
They're all on the edges,
because that's,

1044
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:37,177
there's no point in the plant

1045
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,613
sending energy
to those inner leaves

1046
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,450
if they're not gonna get any
energy in return from the sun.

1047
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,653
An exception to this, conifers
that do handle shade well,

1048
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,856
are yews and hemlocks.

1049
00:44:49,623 --> 00:44:52,559
Additionally, most conifers
have little to no capacity

1050
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:54,595
to grow back from old wood.

1051
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,264
So, this is what we call
latent bud potential.

1052
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:00,067
So, in that example
of tree topping,

1053
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:02,002
when we cut those tops off,

1054
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:04,071
they sprout from what are called
latent buds,

1055
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:06,406
or buds that are dormant
underneath the wood.

1056
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:09,109
Most conifers don't have
these latent buds,

1057
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:11,445
so they can't grow back
from old wood.

1058
00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:13,714
Again, an exception to this
are yews.

1059
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,084
Yews have pretty good
latent bud potential.

1060
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,754
Many conifers also have
extremely strong apical control,

1061
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,556
so they can look really strange

1062
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:25,092
if you cut or damage
the main leader.

1063
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:26,793
So, on the right is an example

1064
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,696
where the terminal leader
has been cut out.

1065
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,398
And that shape's
gonna look weird.

1066
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:33,166
One of those branches
might curve upwards

1067
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,502
and try and take its place.

1068
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:38,038
But it's not gonna ever have
its original shape.

1069
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:39,439
As you can see on the right,

1070
00:45:39,506 --> 00:45:43,076
something happened
to the main leader here,

1071
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:46,180
and it had three or four other
branches kind of take its place,

1072
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,715
but that's not the original
shape that that tree had.

1073
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:51,752
And in addition,
those curved branches,

1074
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:54,388
that weight's gonna be a
little bit unevenly distributed.

1075
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:55,856
And they're more prone
to breakage

1076
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:59,159
if you have a heavy snow
or ice load.

1077
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:03,096
Because conifers
don't sprout new growth

1078
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:05,132
in the same way
that other plants do,

1079
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,602
sometimes they will leave
your pruning areas visible.

1080
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:11,138
So, this is something
like a blue globe spruce.

1081
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,306
They're notorious for this.

1082
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,107
What you wanna try and do
in this case

1083
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:17,110
is hide that pruning cut
behind another branch

1084
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:19,980
that's sitting in front of it,
just to kind of hide that area.

1085
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,315
It's more of an aesthetics
thing.

1086
00:46:21,381 --> 00:46:25,819
It doesn't have any impact
on the health of the plant.

1087
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:27,754
This isn't an embedded video,

1088
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:31,859
but it's a great little primer
into pruning conifers,

1089
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:34,728
with good examples of
manipulating the plants' growth.

1090
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:38,932
If it's like a weeping conifer
or a dwarf conifer,

1091
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,234
this has some good examples.

1092
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,870
It's called "Pruning Conifers
with Adrian Bloom,"

1093
00:46:42,936 --> 00:46:44,538
from Bressingham Gardens.

1094
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:47,608
It's just a great little video.

1095
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,243
So when we're actually
pruning our conifers,

1096
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,545
we're gonna do it
kind of on a species basis.

1097
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,146
And you don't have to know
the species,

1098
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:55,749
but we'll kind of base it
off of the leaf type.

1099
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:58,785
So, pruning pines,
pines come in packets.

1100
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:01,488
Their needles are bundled
into a papery sheath.

1101
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:05,092
These grow from terminal buds
and from undeveloped buds

1102
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:08,161
located on the stem
where there are needles.

1103
00:47:08,228 --> 00:47:13,166
Pruning below that on older wood
won't have any resulting growth.

1104
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:16,937
The plant can be kept small
or kept a little bit dwarfed.

1105
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:19,373
If you start pruning
when the plant is young,

1106
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:21,975
this isn't something where you
say, "Oh, this plant's too big.

1107
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,577
I'm gonna cut it down
really aggressively."

1108
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:26,647
It's not gonna regrow
from that.

1109
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,149
You wanna prune your pines
in the spring,

1110
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,584
when they are candling.

1111
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,452
So, the way pines
send out their new growth,

1112
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,787
it's all kind of bundled
together.

1113
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:35,689
It almost looks like
a candlestick.

1114
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:38,792
So you can prune a third
to a half of the total candle.

1115
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:40,394
This just leaves material behind

1116
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,696
so that it can keep growing
in the future.

1117
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:44,565
And you still want to use
your thinning cuts

1118
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:49,136
and your three Ds to take out
other material on the plant.

1119
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,705
Pruning firs, spruce,
or true cedars.

1120
00:47:51,772 --> 00:47:53,040
These are plants
that have needles,

1121
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:54,842
but the needles
tend to be a lot shorter,

1122
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:56,844
and they're not bundled
together.

1123
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,112
Buds here are located also
at the tips,

1124
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,014
and on current season growth.

1125
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:04,351
If you reach the hard,
woody stem, you've gone too far.

1126
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:06,520
It's easier to prune these guys
when they're dormant,

1127
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:08,522
because then you can see exactly
how much

1128
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:10,023
was current season growth.

1129
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,360
And so as long as you don't take
all of that off, you'll be okay.

1130
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:16,063
You still wanna prune
for good tree structure.

1131
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:18,832
The one on the left has, like,
three competing main leaders.

1132
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,134
So take two of those off,
pick one.

1133
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:24,238
And you still prune
for the three Ds.

1134
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,709
Pruning junipers, arborvitae,
red cedars, and false cypress.

1135
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:33,647
So, these are plants that have
scale- or awl-shaped leaves,

1136
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:35,749
so their leaves might be
very short and prickly,

1137
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:38,986
or they might be kind of flat
and scaly.

1138
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:41,588
You can prune these guys
in late spring to early summer,

1139
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:43,223
because you only wanna prune

1140
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,192
where there are
green leaves present.

1141
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,593
That's where their buds are.

1142
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,231
Again, if you hit brown wood,
you've gone too far.

1143
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,102
Shearing is sometimes done
with these guys

1144
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:57,771
because of their shape,
but it can be very difficult.

1145
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,341
Shearing over time will create
a very thin shell of leaves

1146
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:04,745
around an entirely brown
and twiggy center.

1147
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:07,347
So you only wanna shear these
when they're actively growing

1148
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:11,685
so that you know you're
not taking away too much.

1149
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:13,787
And finally,
our hemlocks and yews.

1150
00:49:13,854 --> 00:49:16,423
These have good
latent bud potential along stems

1151
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,658
for many years.

1152
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:20,093
This means that you can cut
into that brown wood

1153
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,229
and it can sprout afterwards.

1154
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:23,397
These are good for shearing

1155
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,866
because it's okay
if you go a little bit too far.

1156
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:27,234
And even those areas,

1157
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,670
if you shear back and you hit
that kind of brown center,

1158
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:32,606
well, once that stem gets light,
it can send up new buds.

1159
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:34,608
So these are the easiest types
of conifers

1160
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:37,110
to keep small or keep hedged.

1161
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:40,514
And they can be cut during
active or dormant periods,

1162
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:42,382
any time of year, really.

1163
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,319
So, I just have
one practice example here.

1164
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:47,621
Here's our tree,
or part of it anyway.

1165
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:49,756
And the first thing
I'm seeing with this tree

1166
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,525
is that it's just about
codominant.

1167
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:53,794
And that branch
is too narrow to the trunk.

1168
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:56,163
It's gonna have some--

1169
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,232
Oh, there's our width there.

1170
00:49:58,298 --> 00:49:59,933
It's gonna have
some included bark

1171
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,302
down where that red circle is.

1172
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,537
And where the blue circle is

1173
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:05,973
is where it's kind of
getting squished together,

1174
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,041
in the process
of having included bark.

1175
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:09,409
So what we're gonna do,

1176
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,912
I would take
that entire branch off.

1177
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:13,881
Now, because of
how small this tree is,

1178
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:15,682
that's probably my one-third

1179
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:17,518
of the overall material
for that tree.

1180
00:50:17,584 --> 00:50:19,786
So I wouldn't do hardly
anything else for this tree

1181
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:22,222
unless it's already dead
or damaged material

1182
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,091
that I'm taking away.

1183
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:25,826
Additionally, this one had
a good example.

1184
00:50:25,893 --> 00:50:27,661
I know we're taking off
that whole stem.

1185
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:29,863
But this just has
a good example of what I meant

1186
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,300
when we say awkwardly growing
or awkwardly placed branches.

1187
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,536
It's kind of growing
across and outwards.

1188
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:38,772
Over time, it could rub
into the trunk there,

1189
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,211
so you could just prune it where
that little yellow line is.

1190
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:46,880
All right,
now we have time for questions.

1191
00:50:46,947 --> 00:50:48,949
