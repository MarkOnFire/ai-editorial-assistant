at Frank Lloyd Wright's
Taliesin,

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:20,854
an artist adding a splash of
color to Packers gamedays,

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:25,292
a Glendale Special Olympics
athlete winning big...

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,027
- Nice job.
- Yeah!

00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,797
- Angela: ...and a sweet treat
at a strawberry farm

in Fort Atkinson.

11

[whimsical music]

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,216
- Hello, and welcome
to <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,451
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

25
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,587
Let's see if you can guess
where I am.

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,255
I'll give you a few clues.

27
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,691
It's part of the UNESCO
World Heritage site

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,226
and home to one
of Wisconsin's

29
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,494
most
influential architects.

30
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,464
Perhaps you guessed it...
We're at Taliesin,

31
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,266
exploring the life
and legacy

32
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,767
of Frank Lloyd Wright.

33
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,935
Our journey starts here

34
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,571
inside Wright's personal
drafting studio,

35
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,907
one part of this
800-acre estate

36
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,543
just outside Spring Green.

37
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,147
Once a bustling
living laboratory

38
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,150
of architectural ingenuity,

39
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,154
Taliesin was Wright's home
that survived two fires

40
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,790
and endless renovations.

41
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,492
Renovations completed
by apprentices

42
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,327
of the Taliesin Fellowship

43
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,963
that welcomed budding
architects to the property

44
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,698
to learn by doing.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,502
Since this home
was <i>so</i> experimental,

46
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,837
restoration
of the property

47
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,640
can be
particularly challenging.

48
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,643
Visitors can see evidence
of that for themselves,

49
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,745
as they weave in and out
of rooms

50
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,148
that appear to become one
with the landscape.

51
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,316
Getting an up-close look

52
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,052
at where Wright worked,
played, and lived,

53
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,421
alongside apprentices
of the fellowship

54
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,390
and their families.

55
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,959
Let's meet one of the
longtime residents,

56
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,461
now more
than 100 years old,

57
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,531
who still calls
this place home.

58
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,936
As we visit
with Minerva Montooth,

59
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,371
who worked alongside
Frank Lloyd Wright

60
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,106
here at Taliesin.

61
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,049
- Minerva Montooth: They all
studied Frank Lloyd Wright.

62
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,417
It was really a school.

63
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,954
That's what Mr. Wright
started it as.

64
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,456
- Angela:
Meet Minerva Montooth.

65
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,425
She is 101 years old.

66
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,462
And yet, the most
surprising thing about her

67
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,164
is not her age.

68
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,565
It's her address.

69
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,634
- I think I lucked out.

70
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,071
- Angela: Minerva lives at
Frank Lloyd Wright's

71
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,107
Taliesin
in Spring Green, Wisconsin.

72
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,109
And as one of the last
living apprentices

73
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,512
who worked
alongside Mr. Wright,

74
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,247
she is surrounded
each day

75
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,816
by the memories
of their time together.

76
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,984
- Margo: Daddy's smiling.

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,119
There's a picture
of you and Mrs. Wright.

78
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,622
- We were all apprentices.

79
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,426
I remember very well
helping build the theater,

80
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,428
which is where Mr. Wright
suggested

81
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,298
we have our wedding,
which we did.

82
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,200
- Angela: Minerva met
Frank Lloyd Wright

83
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,135
and his wife, Olgivanna,

84
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,672
through her childhood friend
and eventual husband,

85
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,541
Charles Montooth.

86
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,110
- Charles was
a very good architect.

87
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,045
I didn't know what
an architect was.

88
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,382
You know, a farm community,
they just all

89
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,051
built their houses
themselves. [chuckles]

90
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,420
- Angela: Minerva grew up
on a dairy farm.

91
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,790
She and her sister graduated
top of their class,

92
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,426
guaranteeing scholarships
for college.

93
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:23,096
It didn't take long for her
to seek new horizons.

94
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,632
- I went to Chicago,
so I worked

95
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,636
for the Encyclopedia of
Britannica doing research.

96
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,706
And then I got bored with a
little city like Chicago.

97
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,775
I wanted the big lights.
[chuckles]

98
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,743
So I went to New York.

99
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,015
I was the
specialized librarian

100
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,251
for the
advertising agency.

101
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,420
My office was right
over Fifth Avenue,

102
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,588
and I just looked down,

103
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,356
and there was
the whole city.

104
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,693
And so it was a
pretty glamorous job.

105
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,661
- Angela: Minerva's career
took a turn

106
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,365
when she followed her sister
for a trip out to Arizona,

107
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,768
where an old childhood
friend, Charles Montooth,

108
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,872
had been studying
under Frank Lloyd Wright.

109
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:09,476
So began years of visiting
Charles in the desert.

110
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,914
- Charles had been asking me
to marry him for five years.

111
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,217
And so, anyway,
I finally said yes.

112
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,957
- Angela: Minerva's shy outer
shell began to melt away.

113
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:28,896
- I mean, my sister and I
were so shy, twin sister.

114
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,865
I tell you, it was
pathological shyness,

115
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,034
but I got over it
in one day,

116
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,770
meeting
Mr. and Mrs. Wright.

117
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,675
- Angela: To escape the
hardships of winter,

118
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:45,012
the young aspiring architects
studying in Spring Green

119
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,781
would caravan to Arizona.

120
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,651
Charles and Minerva had their
home base in the desert,

121
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,288
where Minerva raised
three children.

122
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,958
- Minerva: We lived for
10 years in a little house

123
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,595
that Charles built,
which was so cute.

124
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,100
He built it by hand,
all glass doors.

125
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,037
At first it was very small,
and then just gradually

126
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,439
he would add bedrooms.

127
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,741
So it got to be a
five-bedroom house,

128
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,145
I think, when we had
three children.

129
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,649
- Angela: Minerva played an
increasingly important role,

130
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,019
not only in her own family,
but to the Wrights

131
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,889
and eventually
their foundation.

132
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,926
- Having Mr. Wright speak to
me on a very familiar level,

133
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,264
I mean, we just were friends
for the moment we met.

134
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,501
- Angela: In 1959, Olgivanna
assumed the role

135
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,836
of president
of the Foundation,

136
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,940
and Minerva began to serve
as her assistant.

137
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,409
- Assistant to Mrs. Wright,
that's what she called me.

138
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,911
She was like Mr. Wright.

139
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,847
She had an idea,
and she wanted it right now.

140
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,149
I was there for 25 years.

141
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:00,053
- Angela: Between
Taliesin West, Spring Green,

142
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,357
and sometimes
international business.

143
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,893
- We went to South Africa.

144
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,295
And Europe many summers.

145
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,498
- Angela: Decades later,

146
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,901
Minerva is the last
living fellow

147
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,171
that spent time with the
original apprenticeship.

148
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,706
- Absolutely incredible
that I was ever here,

149
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,308
that I was ever married
to Charles,

150
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,311
that I was ever
with Mrs. Wright so long,

151
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,812
and that I'm here still.

152
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,349
It's just, all of it
is unbelievable.

153
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,152
- Angela: And going
to great-grandma's house

154
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,688
is a little extra special.

155
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,457
- I'm in awe
that I live here.

156
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,927
Really, I can't believe it.

157
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,429
And I'm very thankful
for all of it.

158
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,498
[gentle piano music]

159
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,707
- Angela: Next up,
we leap over to Lambeau

160
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,443

168
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,394
I also love the idea
of giving,

169
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,762
and having someone else,
the viewer,

170
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,965
have an experience
from that art.

I am an artist working

[groovy bass music]

174
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,947
I think my style
tends to be

175
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,115
a little bit
more illustrative

176
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,651
than a lot
of fine artists.

177
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,523
And I mostly work
in acrylics,

178
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,859
whether that's on the side
of a large building

179
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,093
or whether
it's on a canvas.

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,497
I want both to look equally
the same.

181
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,499
I work intuitively.

182
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,502
I mean, I really don't have
too much of a plan.

183
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,670
When I make a mark,

184
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,471
I like to make a mark
and move on.

185
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,874
I don't like to fiddle with
it and keep messing with it.

186
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,776
Once I make a mark
or a gesture,

187
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,980
I wanna move on to the
next mark kind of thing.

[birds chirping]

189
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,095
I love the idea of flowers
and bees

190
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,231
because there's a
symbiotic relationship

191
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,532
that is happening there

192
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,300
with the fertilization
of the flowers

193
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:04,171
and how they're dependent
on each other.

194
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,275
There's a little bit
of a darker side

195
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,710
to the flower things too.

196
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,879
I did lose
both of my parents.

197
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,248
Y'know, my father died
at a young age.

198
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,583
I had a lot
of funeral experience.

199
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,851
We'll put it that way.

200
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,721
So the idea of flowers,
even the smell of flowers,

201
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,723
would always remind me
of death,

202
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,891
to be honest with you.

203
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,827
So in a way,
painting flowers

204
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,028
kind of gives me
the ability

205
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:32,032
to kind of take control
of that a little bit.

[upbeat electronic music]

207
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,707
And take that and make it
into something

208
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,875
that's a little bit
different,

209
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,746
a little bit different
memory than that.

So the Art-Hop
is a collective

213
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,368
of artists and musicians.

214
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,238
The three main components
of Art-Hop right now

215
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:15,142
are myself, Gregory Frederic,
and DJ RGS.

216
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,411
And we have been
working for,

217
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,079
I think about
eight years now,

218
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:23,116
y'know, bringing art
and music together.

219
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,685
So I've been working
with the Packers

220
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,420
for about seven years now.

221
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,255
And then now,
for the last three seasons,

222
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,257
we've been doing
every home game.

223
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,926
So we'll welcome, y'know,
the visiting team.

224
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,261
So let's say it's Chicago.

225
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:37,130
We'll say "Chicago," y'know,
"versus Green Bay," right?

226
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,733
And we'll allow the fans
then to approach that

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,368
with welcoming arms.

228
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:45,706
On game day, we arrive about
five hours before kickoff.

229
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,541
And then, we paint
for three hours

230
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:48,709
prior to the game.

231
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,943
People love it.

232
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,745
I think it's something
very unique for Green Bay.

[camera shutters clicking]

234
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,496
What does art mean to me?

235
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,001
That's an
interesting question.

236
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:18,772
Art is something that you can
speak without polarization.

237
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,374
Y'know, we live
in this world

238
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,711
where whatever you say
can be, y'know, mistaken

239
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,213
and perhaps, y'know,

240
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,081
people can get the wrong
impression very quickly.

241
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,483
Or maybe they get
the right impression.

242
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,651
I don't know.

243
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,152
But street art is not,
y'know,

244
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,321
considered graffiti
anymore.

245
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,890
I think that allows
the viewer

246
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,325
to approach art
in a way,

247
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,160
give themselves that
little moment of pause

248
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:43,230
where they, y'know, have a
little moment of positivity

249
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:45,365
in their hectic day,
you know?

250
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,767
And I think that's
what it is.

251
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,968
I think art
can really heal.

252
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:51,271
I think there's something
to that.

253
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,510
- We're exploring Taliesin,

254
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,012
home and studio
of Frank Lloyd Wright,

255
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,280
touring the estate

256
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:05,485
and learning about their
extensive restoration work.

257
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,556
My first stop was
to the Hillside Theater

258
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,625
to meet up
with Executive Director

259
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,460
Carrie Rodamaker,

260
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,797
and to learn more about the
history and preservation

261
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,199
of this 800-acre estate.

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,970
- Carrie Rodamaker: Taliesin is
Frank Lloyd Wright's home.

263
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,137
This is a place

264
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,573
where his ancestors
immigrated from Wales.

265
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,009
He grew to love this area,

266
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:32,946
and eventually built
his own home in 1911.

267
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,249
One of the things that Wright
was doing was playing

268
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,584
with the surrounding beauty
of the land

269
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:41,054
and incorporating
his buildings into it.

270
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,856
- Beautiful, and so
what does that look like

271
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,591
in terms of how
they're constructed?

272
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,728
- So, part of it is
organic architecture.

273
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,963
So using natural material.

274
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,300
A lot of the limestone
was harvested from here.

275
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,668
You'll see a lot of oak.

276
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:56,637
But you'll also see a lot
of new materials,

277
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,338
like plywood.

278
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,241
Because of all of those
kind of natural materials,

279
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,709
and this being
that laboratory,

280
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,245
that experimental place
for Wright,

281
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,848
it poses huge challenges.

282
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,117
It's almost like an
archaeological dig,

283
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,186
so we can understand
what they were doing

284
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,987
before we can start
to figure out

285
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,923
how do we
kind of reconstruct

286
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,625
and preserve
the historic fabric,

287
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:23,030
but also making it
sustainable for the future.

288
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,801
- Angela: An example
of that historic fabric

289
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,003
is this curtain
Wright designed

290
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,439
that hangs
in Taliesin's theater,

291
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,775
where we chatted
with Caroline Hamblen,

292
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,877
Director of Programs.

293
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,278
- Caroline Hamblen: So the
Hillside Theater

294
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,446
just reopened last year.

295
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,481
It was designed by Wright
to bring lectures,

296
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,319
dance, theater, movies
into the space.

297
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,488
And that legacy is something
that we're continuing to today.

298
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,890
- Are there other types
of programs

299
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,058
or other opportunities

300
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,726
that are available here?
- Absolutely.

301
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,862
So, we have our
regular tour program.

302
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,930
There is four different
variety of tours

303
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,532
that you can come
and engage with us

304
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,000
May through October.

305
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,668
We work a lot with schools.

306
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,371
We love working with
educators from the region,

307
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,839
bringing their students
here.

308
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,342
Then there is
workshop opportunities,

309
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,576
and then we have
the programming

310
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:13,213
of the Hillside Theater
available as well.

311
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,316
- So lots of opportunities
throughout the estate

312
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,252
for all ages
throughout the year.

313
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,419
- Yes, absolutely.

314
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,954
And that is really
the goal,

315
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,056
that is what Taliesin
always has been,

316
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,826
and that's what we want
to continue into the future.

317
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:27,127
All kinds
of different ages,

318
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,396
different interests,
bringing everybody here

319
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:32,933
into this UNESCO
World Heritage site now.

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,735
- Angela: A site that
will be preserved

321
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,137
for future generations.

322
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,340
From the stage...
- Caroline: Now you can see

323
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,177
how the size of the stage
almost doubled.

324
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,179
You notice that part
of the stage

325
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,247
is built into the ground.

326
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,448
And that caused a lot

327
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,618
of water infiltration
issues.

328
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,487
- Angela:
...to the green rooms.

329
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,088
So this is part
of the new space?

330
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,623
- Caroline: We've never had
green rooms

331
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,458
for the artists.

332
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:02,863
The room behind the stage
used to be dirt floor.

333
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,799
- Angela: All to honor the
world-famous architect

334
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,036
who Carrie Rodamaker says
loved Wisconsin

335
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,004
and called it home.

336
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,807
- Carrie: I think we just
want to celebrate Wisconsin,

337
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:16,343
we wanna celebrate
this place.

338
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,111
Celebrate Wright
for growing up

339
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,047
as a Wisconsin farm kid.

340
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,782
This is where
he was really creating

341
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:23,350
an architecture
for America,

342
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:27,221
and we encourage people
to come and see it.

343
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,956
[bright music]

344
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,532
- Angela: Now, we meet
a Glendale athlete

345
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:43,270
sharing her journey
from challenges to triumphs.

346
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,308
[gentle music]

347
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,013
Cindy Bentley
has never given up.

348
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,516
As executive director
of People First,

349
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,217
she has dedicated
her career

350
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,686
to helping others
with disabilities.

351
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,656
- Cindy Bentley: You have to
have a purpose to be alive,

352
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,925
but you also have to have
a purpose

353
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:07,261
to helping other people.

354
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,229
I like helping other people.

355
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,298
- Angela: She serves
on several boards

356
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,100
and works
with state agencies,

357
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,003
advocating
for equal opportunities.

358
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,739
It's a long way
from where she started.

359
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:22,543
- I was born with fetal
alcoholic syndrome/cocaine.

360
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,345
I was given
24 hours to live.

361
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,182
I was taken away from my mom
right at birth.

362
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,717
My mother was sent
to the Taycheedah prison

363
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,320
and I was sent
to the foster care center.

364
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,356
- Angela: Tragedy followed
Cindy at an early age.

365
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,660
At age eight, Cindy was sent
to an institution

366
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,929
for people
with disabilities.

367
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,530
- Cindy: And it wasn't
the greatest place.

368
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,600
And I was always having
to fight my way through.

369
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:49,503
A lot of times,
I thought about giving up.

370
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,371
I really did.

371
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,909
And I didn't think I had a
purpose for a long time.

372
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,214
It was a coach there
to help me.

373
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,381
I started running,

374
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,483
but I would complain
a lot about it.

375
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,186
Then I started
to like running.

376
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,989
And then I joined
the Special Olympics,

377
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:12,292
and that's what really
changed my life.

378
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,828
I just started to be happy.

379
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,597
- Angela:
Cindy also discovered

380
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,899
she was good at winning.

381
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,635
Those wins led her
to receive

382
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:25,005
a White House invitation
twice.

383
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:28,408
- Cindy: President Clinton
in 2000.

384
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,677
President Bush.

385
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:35,415
And I gave him a gold medal
that I won in volleyball.

386
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,583
- Angela: That's right.

387
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,986
She gave her gold medal
away.

388
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,589
In fact, she's given many
of her medals away.

389
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,658
- Cindy: And how many medals
can you have?

390
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,727
I have a lot of medals.

391
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,129
- Angela: With a lifetime
of medals...

392
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,297
- Two.

393
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:53,367
- Angela: ...Cindy still
finds reasons to compete.

394
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,737
- Cindy: I started getting
a trainer last year

395
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,139
to get me more motivated.

396
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,074
She's a great trainer.

397
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,178
Nine and ten.
- Trainer: Nice job.

398
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,612
- Yeah!

399
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,616
And I work on basketball
and I work on balance,

400
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,685
and then I do the bikes
and that.

401
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:13,754
I just wanna be involved
with sports.

402
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,156
I'm a Brewer fan,
don't forget that.

403
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,491
- All right!
[hands slap]

404
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,993
- Angela: Sports keeps Cindy
involved in the community,

405
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,363
and community is the heart
of what Cindy does,

406
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,234
whether on a personal level
or through her work.

407
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,836
- Nancy Gapinski: These are
from last year

408
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,003
that I printed.

409
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,405
I printed extras
so you'd have them.

410
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,807
- Angela: She keeps an active
schedule at People First,

411
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:36,176
working closely with her
operations manager

412
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,345
and assistant, Nancy.

413
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,747
- A lot of what we do is
we try to really

414
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:43,317
keep an eye on what's going on
at the state level,

415
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,385
at the federal level
with different bills

416
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,054
that might impact people
with disabilities,

417
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,722
so she's pretty active.

418
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,724
Sometimes I feel
like I'm with a celebrity

419
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,826
when I'm out in the
community with her

420
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:55,495
because everyone's like,
"Oh, hi, Cindy, hi, Cindy."

421
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,464
And it's kinda wild.

422
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,733
- Let's clap it up for Cindy
real quick.

423
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,269
[applause and cheers]
- Angela: In May of 2024,

424
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:04,805
Cindy was celebrated
by People First

425
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,607
and the State of Wisconsin.

426
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,775
- Hereby recognize
the legacy.

427
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,043
- Oh, my God.

428
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,447
- Right, the legacy
of Cindy Bentley

429
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:17,284
and celebrates the positive
impact she has had

430
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:21,622
on countless individuals
in our greater community.

431
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,025
So thank you.
[applause and cheers]

432
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,796
- Angela: For Cindy,
it means so much more.

433
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,233
It's a marker of just
how far she has come.

434
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,435
- Cindy: I didn't even think
I'd make it this far

435
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,337
to my age because
of what I was told.

436
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,505
You know, they said,

437
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,941
"Oh, you're not gonna amount
to anything.

438
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:42,809
"You're gonna have to work
at a shelter workshop

439
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:45,212
and live at a group home
all your life."

440
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,780
Well, I don't do
any of that.

441
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,515
I have a real job.

442
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,718
I have a real life.

443
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:54,054
- Angela: A life
as an athlete,

444
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,590
an executive,
a champion.

445
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,826
- Cindy: Trying to change
things, change laws,

446
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,363
change healthcare and make it
better, affordable housing,

447
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,898
all those things.

448
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,168
Until I can't do it anymore,
I'm gonna do sports

449
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,837
and I'm gonna do
everything else

450
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:11,305
I wanna do with my life.

451
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,041
Done, there you go!
[laughs]

452
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,677
Bye, love you!

453
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,249
- Angela: Our last story ends
on a juicy note,

454
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,451
as we head
to a Fort Atkinson farm

455
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:30,090
to check out their tech-savvy
twist to strawberry growing.

456
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,027
[upbeat music]

457
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,731
- Erin Warner:
My horticulture journey,

458
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,202
professionally, started
much later in my life.

459
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,004
I didn't know where that
was gonna lead me,

460
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:48,642
but I knew that it would
make sense when I got here.

461
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:52,279
We do the hydroponic
strawberry u-pick operation,

462
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:55,349
and that is
about 18,000 plants.

463
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,785
Every year, all the
different containers

464
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,522
get refilled
and replanted.

465
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,624
I'm the horticulturist.

466
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,593
I'm also one
of the farm managers.

467
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,695
The name of the farm
is Warm Belly Farm.

468
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,764
It just means that
we feel really happy,

469
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,199
we feel really full.

470
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:14,468
We feel that this is
a positive place

471
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,636
for people to be,

472
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,071
so that's what Warm Belly
means to us.

473
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:19,806
How's it going?

474
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:24,478
A good day for me is when
people come out to the farm

475
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,480
and they get to experience
our strawberries,

476
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,749
and they might not have
picked strawberries

477
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,584
in 20, 30 years.

478
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:31,818
Because it's
a raised gutter system

479
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,155
off the ground,
no one has to bend over.

480
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,491
I don't know really
many other farms

481
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,692
that are open
to the public

482
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,562
that are
hydroponic systems.

483
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,066
Growing hydroponically
just really means

484
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:49,136
that you're growing
not in the soil.

485
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:52,339
We use a media
called substrate.

486
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:54,141
This is a Bluelab
Pulse Meter,

487
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,109
and it's gonna test the
electrical conductivity

488
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:57,845
of the substrate.

489
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,513
So I'm able to control

490
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,014
how much nutrients
are being used,

491
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,116
how much water
is being used.

492
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,219
I have it all controlled
from my app.

493
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:08,088
It's telling me
it has an EC of 1.1

494
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:10,624
and a soil moisture of 35%.

495
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,193
The whole idea
of hydroponics

496
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,496
stem from the idea that
the climate is changing.

497
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,165
People are being forced
to farm

498
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,766
in new and progressive ways

499
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,202
using more science
and technology.

500
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,538
We do things
as environmentally-friendly

501
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,273
as possible.

502
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,709
I've always grown up
in nature.

503
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:32,946
You know, I wanna preserve
it for the future.

504
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,214
I grew up
in Sheboygan Falls,

505
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,416
so just a tiny little town.

506
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:40,721
I learned to garden
with my family growing up.

507
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,691
I would say I always had
just a really andventurous,

508
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,895
like, wanderlust type
of spirit.

509
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:51,431
I went back to school
when I was 25,

510
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:54,601
but I didn't graduate
until I was 31.

511
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,436
I think the passion
comes from

512
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,272
just taking time
in my life

513
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:01,608
to figure out exactly
what I wanted to do.

514
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,210
I ended up here,

515
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:06,480
and I feel
like it's the right place.

516
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:08,715
We've planted
around 8,000 more trees

517
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,684
on about five acres.

518
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,587
We have seven acres total
of apple trees right now.

519
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,389
So in the coming years,
we expect to have

520
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,957
half a million pounds
of apples

521
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:19,026
coming down the line.

522
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,096
I think that Wisconsin
is really special

523
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,965
because we have
these seasons.

524
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,401
It's part of who we are
as people.

525
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,203
People are just really
connected to the land here,

526
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,172
and that's what
makes it great.

527
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,909
For me, it's plants,
it's horticulture.

528
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,077
It gives me a chance

529
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,312
to interact
with the environment,

530
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:40,714
to interact with people.

531
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:44,852
And it's also kinda
this blend

532
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:48,121
between science and nature
that really excites me.

533
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:52,593
It'll pull from both tanks,
the A and the B tank.

534
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,461
I see opportunity
everywhere here,

535
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,964
and I see a future,
I see a career.

536
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,465
I'm just really thankful

537
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:00,267
that my life
led me to this point

538
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,769
because this is something
that I'm passionate about

539
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,071
and I'm excited about,

540
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,406
and I'm just really, really
looking forward

541
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:09,376
to see what
Warm Belly becomes.
