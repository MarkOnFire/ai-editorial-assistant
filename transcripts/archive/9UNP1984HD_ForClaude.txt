- Margaret Alexander:
Good evening, everyone,

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,547
and welcome
to our Crossroads of Ideas,

4
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,984
Gut Instincts: Microbes,
Addiction, and Immunity,

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,120
part one in our
microbiome miniseries.

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,189
I am Dr. Margaret Alexander.

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,359
I am an assistant professor
here at UW-Madison

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,762
in the Department of Medical
Microbiology and Immunology.

9
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,497
I did my post-doctoral training

10
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,333
at University of California,
San Francisco

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,404
and my doctorate
at the University of Utah.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,176
Today, we're gonna be talking
about this Crossroads of Ideas.

13
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,677
And this is a collaboration

14
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,580
between the Wisconsin Institute
for Discovery,

15
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,949
the Morgridge
Institute of Research,

16
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,653
and the UW-Madison
Strategic Communications.

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,355
And it's an opportunity
to foster dialogue

18
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,159
between community
and UW-Madison researchers.

19
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,995
The series addresses issues
that matter to all of us,

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,964
and are also the subject
of research

21
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,700
that is going on at UW-Madison.

22
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,671
Since 2014, Crossroads has been
a staple of public programming

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,639
and offered
at the Discovery Building

24
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,842
at UW-Madison campus.

25
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,780
So tonight, we're here
to kick off

26
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,115
an exciting three-part
miniseries

27
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,618
on the gut-brain superhighway

28
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,753
and the complex interplay
between microbes,

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,156
addiction, and immunity.

30
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,458
I'm going to give a brief
introduction of my connection

31
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,626
to this topic,

32
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,127
and then I will invite
my colleague,

33
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,196
Dr. Vanessa Sperandio,
to the stage

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,397
for an overview of her work

35
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,000
and then a brief conversation
with me,

36
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,135
and we'll make sure
to save time at the end

37
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,904
for audience questions
and answers.

38
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,975
So please have
your questions ready for us.

39
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,144
All right, so today, we're here
to talk about

40
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,848
Gut Instincts: Microbes,
Addiction, and Immunity.

41
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,117
And my research focuses
on two of these,

42
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,622
in particular, these microbes
and the immunity connection

43
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,591
that we're talking about today.

44
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,159
But before I go
into my research,

45
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,328
I'd like to share
this poem excerpt

46
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,998
from a Sylvia Plath poem
called "Mushrooms"

47
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,433
because for me,
this really sort of

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,136
gives an image
of our microbiota.

49
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,305
So here's this excerpt.

50
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,008
"Nobody sees us, stops us,
betrays us.

51
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,544
"Small grains make room...

52
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,680
"We diet on water,
on crumbs of shadow,

53
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,616
"bland-mannered,
asking little or nothing.

54
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,118
"So many of us!

55
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,853
So many of us!"

56
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,956
And I love sharing this poem

57
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,560
because it really brings up
this image of the microbiota,

58
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,929
which are these trillions
of microorganisms

59
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,065
that are colonizing
both inside of us

60
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:49,203
and our gastrointestinal tract,
and on us, on our skin.

61
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,172
And these microbes
consist of bacteria,

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,575
of viruses, and of fungi,

63
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,477
and are known
to have significant impacts

64
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,547
on our health
as well as disease.

65
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,650
And so the research
that I work on

66
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,852
and our lab works on

67
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,021
is focused
on thinking about the mechanisms

68
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,457
of the interactions
between our diet,

69
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,827
our microbiota,
and our immune system.

70
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,662
And we're
particularly interested in this

71
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,399
in the context
of autoimmune diseases.

72
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,535
And the way we approach this,

73
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,338
we come at this
from a couple different angles.

74
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,040
One of which
is a microbe-centric approach,

75
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:30,277
where we sort of take
the perspective of a microbe

76
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,713
and think about microbes that
are altered

77
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,082
in disease states
like autoimmunity,

78
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,384
and try and understand
how those microbes

79
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,319
impact immune responses

80
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,956
that are contributing to these
autoimmune disease states.

81
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,158
And so, with this
microbe-centric approach,

82
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,493
you might think of a microbe

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,129
that is elevated
in an autoimmune condition

84
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,764
like multiple sclerosis.

85
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,667
So our questions are,
is that elevation leading

86
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,104
to changes in immune responses
that contribute to disease,

87
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,540
and can by understanding
more about

88
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,643
how these microbes impact
immune responses,

89
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,647
can we target interventions
for those pathways,

90
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,917
that cross talk between microbe
and immune response?

91
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,718
And one of the ways
we can target this

92
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,120
is thinking about diets

93
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,355
that might modulate
the conversation

94
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,293
between our microbes
and the immune response.

95
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,195
So I won't talk too much
about this today.

96
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,397
I just want to give you
a brief thought about thinking

97
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,365
from the microbe perspective.

98
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,402
But another way we approach this
question is thinking about it

99
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,871
from a diet-centric approach.

100
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,873
So this, we think about diets

101
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,709
that are used in the clinic
or in clinical trials

102
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,745
to mitigate disease
in autoimmunity.

103
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,581
And what we really
want to understand is

104
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,252
how these complex diets impact
these autoimmune disease states.

105
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,789
And trying to understand the
interactions between microbiota

106
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,958
and immune response
that happens during this

107
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
that can mediate that response.

108
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,864
And so this is a big question

109
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,534
of how do diets impact
autoimmune diseases.

110
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,269
This is a
pretty intimidating question

111
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,271
to look at at this scale.

112
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:08,208
And so what we do is try
and focus on specific examples.

113
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,210
And so the example I'm
gonna tell you about today

114
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:14,381
is about a ketogenic diet
and multiple sclerosis.

115
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,650
And this was really exciting
and interesting to us

116
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,319
because there have been now
phase two clinical trials,

117
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,756
as well as many mouse models
of multiple sclerosis

118
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,392
that have seen a protective
effect of a ketogenic diet

119
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,094
in multiple sclerosis.

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,531
But the big question was,
how exactly is this happening?

121
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,534
Can we figure out more
about the host

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,569
and microbiota mechanisms
that are driving this,

123
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,137
so that we can understand more

124
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,872
about why there might be
variation

125
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,308
in patient responsiveness
to this diet?

126
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,244
Can we get better specific
bioactive compounds

127
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,580
that might be sufficient
to mediate these things

128
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,183
without having
this complex diet?

129
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,251
And that is because,
as I was saying,

130
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,320
ketogenic diets are complex.

131
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:56,223
They're sort of defined
by the strict restriction

132
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,858
in carbohydrates.

133
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,561
And that's really shifting
host metabolism

134
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,529
to instead of breaking down
carbohydrates

135
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,866
as an energy source,
breaking down free fatty acids.

136
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,935
And this process
is called ketogenesis

137
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,805
and actually is what the
ketogenic diet is named after.

138
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,607
And so what
we wanted to do is try

139
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,542
and understand more
about the mechanisms

140
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,846
of how this protection
takes place.

141
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,081
And so I'm gonna walk you
through sort of,

142
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,418
we just published this story
recently thinking about

143
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,753
how a ketogenic diet
is protective

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,489
in mouse models
of multiple sclerosis.

145
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,458
And we sort of started this
with our thought

146
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,427
that a ketogenic diet
is complex.

147
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,029
And so are there things
that are changing in the host

148
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,631
during a ketogenic diet

149
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,366
that might be mediating
this protect

150
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,336
without having to have
the complex diet?

151
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,338
And one of the things
that I mentioned happens

152
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,273
is this switch
to ketogenesis,

153
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,877
where you're making ketone
bodies as a form of energy.

154
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,712
And so what
we wanted to do is see,

155
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,215
can we pharmacologically
elevate levels of ketone bodies

156
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,318
like beta hydroxybutyrate
and get levels of protection

157
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,555
that are similar
to that complex ketogenic diet?

158
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,457
And that was one of the things
we observed.

159
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,460
Just by increasing
levels of beta hydroxybutyrate,

160
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:10,531
we were able to get protection
in our mouse models of disease.

161
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,833
And so this gave us some insight
on the host mechanisms

162
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,202
that were happening
in this protection.

163
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,172
But we wanted to know what was
happening with the microbiota,

164
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,973
because there's a strong link
to the microbiota

165
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,410
and mediating
autoimmune disease phenotypes.

166
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,914
And so one way to get at this
is to compare response to diet

167
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,783
in mice that have
an intact microbiota

168
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,386
versus mice that don't have
any microbes at all,

169
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,054
which are called germ-free mice.

170
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,889
And when we compared
germ-free mice

171
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,960
to normally colonized mice
with intact microbiota,

172
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,296
the germ-free mice
didn't have a protective effect

173
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,999
in response to a ketogenic diet
in our models of MS.

174
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,535
Really telling us
that the microbiota

175
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,705
is necessary to be there
to get a benefit

176
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,474
from that diet
in the model that we're using.

177
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,310
And then additionally,
what we wondered is,

178
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,345
is a microbial community

179
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:02,316
that's shaped by exposure
to this ketone body,

180
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,917
beta hydroxybutyrate,

181
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,287
is that gonna be sufficient
to give protection from disease?

182
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,989
So can we take microbiota

183
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,860
that's shaped by the presence
of beta hydroxybutyrate,

184
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,530
put that into a mouse,
and see if that looks the same

185
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,499
as just giving the supplemented
beta hydroxybutyrate?

186
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,701
And that is what we saw.

187
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,970
A community
that's shaped by BHB

188
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,772
was also able to convey
that effect.

189
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,575
And so we have this idea
that the ketone body,

190
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,211
beta hydroxybutyrate,
shapes the composition

191
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,880
or function of the microbiota

192
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,015
in some way
that is mediating some

193
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,451
of these protective effects.

194
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,785
And then our next
questions were,

195
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,521
okay, the microbiota,
as I was saying,

196
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,055
there's trillions
of microorganisms.

197
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,924
There's hundreds of species.

198
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:47,828
So are there particular species
that are mediating this?

199
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,329
And so we looked into this

200
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,466
and used some
previous literature and data

201
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,601
out there in the field

202
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,904
to kind of get at what
members of the microbiota

203
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,272
might be involved in this.

204
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,274
And what we saw is
that there was a member

205
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,110
of the microbiota called
<i>Lactobacillus</i>

206
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,146
that was able to be increased
by exposure

207
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,814
to beta hydroxybutyrate.

208
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,851
And so we wondered
if just by supplementing mice

209
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,188
with <i>Lactobacillus,</i>
could we get similar response.

210
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,355
And then additionally,

211
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,658
what we knew
from the literature in the field

212
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,628
was that <i>Lactobacillus</i> make
this metabolite called

213
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,797
indole lactate acid.

214
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,566
And indole lactic acid
had been seen

215
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,001
to have this
potent immune effect

216
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,003
where it can inhibit
immune responses

217
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,708
that are known to contribute to
multiple sclerosis pathologies.

218
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,411
And so what we did is
just by supplementing mice

219
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,948
with our <i>Lactobacillus</i> or
this metabolite indole lactate,

220
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,917
we saw a similar amount
of protection,

221
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,054
which we think is acting
through mediating signals

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,189
to the immune responses
that contribute

223
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,458
to multiple sclerosis
phenotypes.

224
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,560
And the specific response
that we were looking at was

225
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:57,731
these adaptive immune responses
called T helper 17 responses.

226
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,900
And so this is the story so far

227
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,436
that we think is happening
in this protective effect

228
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:05,072
of a ketogenic diet
and multiple sclerosis,

229
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,474
where the host is making
beta hydroxybutyrate,

230
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:11,478
impacting the microbiota
and production of metabolites

231
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,947
that can then feed
into immune responses

232
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,382
and inhibit immune responses

233
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,086
that are contributing
to multiple sclerosis.

234
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,755
But we have a lot of things
that we're needing to do

235
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,657
to figure out more
about these connections.

236
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:27,227
So how exactly
is BHB impacting the microbiota?

237
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,096
How does this
microbial metabolite

238
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,831
impact the immune response?

239
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,366
And additionally,
are there other things

240
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,535
that are happening
during a ketogenic diet

241
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,237
that might also lead
to some of these effects?

242
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,639
And these are some of the things

243
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,543
that we're currently working
on in the lab.

244
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,678
And so with that,
I want to acknowledge everyone

245
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,480
that helped do this work.

246
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,416
And thank you all
so much for your attention.

247
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:53,320
And I will transition now
to Dr. Sperandio.

248
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,821
I would like
to introduce my colleague,

249
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,990

259
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,283
in the State University
of Campinas in Brazil.

260
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,853
Please join me
in welcoming Doctor Sperandio.

261
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,588
[applause]

262
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,364
- So I know I have
a very long title,

263
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:42,369
but the gist of this talk
is chemical interactions

264
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:46,573
between host neurotransmitters,
microbial chemical signals

265
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,478
that they make with pathogens,
the microbiota in the intestine

266
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,616
and the host in health
and disease states.

267
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:59,686
So the gut-brain axis
is the two-way street

268
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:04,258
of communication
between microbes and the host.

269
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,895
There is a strong correlation
between microbiota composition

270
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,396
and microbial pathogenesis

271
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,567
with host neurological diseases
and behaviors.

272
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,068
Members of the microbiota

273
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,939
are known to modulate the levels
as well as the activity

274
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,775
of neurotransmitters in the gut.

275
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:27,648
And this rich chemical exchange
affects bacterial pathogenesis,

276
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,516
amongst other processes.

277
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,352
And we want to exploit
this chemical signaling

278
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,787
and understand it

279
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:39,092
so we can develop novel types
of therapies for diseases.

280
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,932
So I'm gonna focus
on several of neurotransmitters

281
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,800
that are found in the gut.

282
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,302
And I'll start

283
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,638
in why do we look
at neurotransmitters in the gut?

284
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,641
Because your brain
is connected to the gut

285
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:59,413
and you have a highly innervated
enteric nervous system.

286
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,715
That's why you
have that "gut feeling."

287
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,518
And you're basically,
your lumen here,

288
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:07,921
where the microbiota is
and where pathogens come first,

289
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,391
is full of a whole array
of neurotransmitters

290
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,393
that microbes see every day.

291
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,029
So they learn to sense them.

292
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,901
So mammalian cells tend
to sense this neurotransmitter

293
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,938
using these types of receptors
here that are called GPCRs.

294
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,709
However, bacteria
usually don't use that.

295
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:33,146
Their preference is to use
receptors in their surface

296
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,616
that are called
histidine kinase.

297
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,018
What happens
here is these receptors,

298
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,153
upon binding to their signals,

299
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,422
they will phosphorylate
themselves.

300
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,058
That starts a signaling cascade
in the cell.

301
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,529
That goes on to change
gene expression

302
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,931
within a bacterial cell.

303
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,334
So all
of these neurotransmitters

304
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,069
that are sensed by bacteria,

305
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,873
they cross react with
bacterial signals too, okay?

306
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,676
And this cross signaling here,

307
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,012
we call it
interkingdom signaling

308
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,014
because as I mentioned,

309
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,217
mammalian cells use hormones
and neurotransmitters

310
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,387
to communicate with each other
and coordinate behaviors.

311
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,089
Bacterial communities
also use chemicals

312
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,326
that in the field,
we call autoinducers,

313
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,562
in a process known
as quorum sensing

314
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,264
to coordinate
population behavior

315
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,800
amongst bacterial cells.

316
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:32,940
So the first system that we
studied in my lab is this one,

317
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,942
in which
the host neurotransmitters

318
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,710
are epinephrine, norepinephrine.

319
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,413
This is adrenaline
and noradrenaline.

320
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,217
You can say bacteria
can be adrenaline junkies too.

321
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:47,020
And they are stress
neurotransmitters involved

322
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,522
in the fight or flight.

323
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,425
But importantly, they control
intestinal motility,

324
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,460
chloride and potassium
secretion,

325
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:57,064
and also impact
immune responses in the host.

326
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,367
The bacterial signal
that cross talks with this one

327
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:03,804
is this signal here
that we call autoinducer-3.

328
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:07,374
For chemical aficionados,
these are pyrazinones.

329
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,743
They are made by many,
many species of bacteria,

330
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,111
but importantly,

331
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,314
they're made by the microbiota
in the gut of human beings

332
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,049
and also mice.

333
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,654
The way this system works
is you have one

334
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,289
of these histidine kinases.

335
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,058
In the case,
we named this QseC.

336
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,727
And it will sense either

337
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,563
the epinephrine/norepinephrine
from the host

338
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,899
or the AI-3
from the microbiota.

339
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,867
That activates the kinase.

340
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,437
So here is no activation,
no, just basal phosphorylation.

341
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,607
You can see that
just by how big these bars are.

342
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,976
Here you have
the bacterial signal AI-3.

343
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,444
Here you have epinephrine.

344
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,247
And both of them,
it activates all the way.

345
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,917
And what this translates
into the signaling cascade

346
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,654
is activation of virulence
in many bacterial pathogens.

347
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,523
All of the virulence programs.

348
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,159
Just for you to have an idea,

349
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,629
this system controls
pathogenesis

350
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,699
in gastrointestinal pathogens,
urinary tract infections,

351
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:09,570
ventilator associated pathogens,
and many others.

352
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,506
So it has always been
thought of as a good target

353
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,575
for antimicrobial therapy.

354
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,579
And yes, QseC, which is
the bacterial sensor for this

355
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,449
can be inhibited using
alpha-adrenergic antagonists

356
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:23,917
such as phentolamine.

357
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,354
But they also will hit
mammalian adrenergic receptors,

358
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,289
which is not desirable.

359
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,693
So we did chemical screens
to look for molecules

360
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,262
such as this one, LED209,

361
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,332
which selectively will hit
the bacterial QseC

362
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,869
but will leave the mammalian
adrenergic receptors alone.

363
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,270
And by using this,

364
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:47,140
we've been able to prevent
virulence in vitro

365
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,676
and during mammalian infection
of many,

366
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,145
many bacterial pathogens.

367
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,549
And the reason,
and these strategies

368
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,552
are what we call
anti-virulence approaches,

369
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,754
because you're inhibiting
the start

370
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,423
of the pathogenesis process
in the bacteria,

371
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,426
but not growth,
and you're not killing them.

372
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,529
And the thought process
in that is that

373
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,397
there is less selective pressure

374
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,267
for this bacteria to develop
antimicrobial resistance

375
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,602
because you're not going
with a hammer.

376
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,372
You're going with a scalpel.

377
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,574
So, but are all stress,

378
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,212
but all signaling in this
interkingdom communications,

379
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,181
is it always stressful?

380
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,383
And the answer
is not necessarily

381
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:33,453
because you do have several
neurotransmitters in your gut

382
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,621
that are kind of calming,

383
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:38,158
endocannabinoids
being one of them.

384
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,763
And yes, you have
endocannabinoid receptors

385
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,498
in your gut, okay,

386
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,368
and that sense
plant cannabinoids.

387
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:52,172
But you didn't evolve
to sense the plant cannabinoids.

388
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,041
The reason
you have these receptors

389
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,010
is because you yourself
in the intestine

390
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:01,448
make plenty of endocannabinoids
that you make yourself.

391
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:07,120
And the one we work with is
2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG.

392
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,523
And don't worry,
not a thing.

393
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,024
Everything's gonna be all right.

394
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,927
But please don't get out of here
and go do something

395
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:16,864
and tell people that I told you
to do so because I did not.

396
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,732
[audience laughing]

397
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,269
So what does
this endocannabinoid system does

398
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,871
for your physiology?

399
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,839
As I mentioned,
this is a common thing.

400
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,675
It decreases inflammation.

401
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,446
It reduces
colitis susceptibility.

402
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:36,550
And in fact,
recreational cannabinoids

403
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:40,087
have been used to alleviate
IBD symptoms

404
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,822
and also colitis.

405
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,559
And the one that we study
is 2-AG.

406
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,963
And it also interfaces
with the microbiota

407
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,965
because there is one member
of the microbiota,

408
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,267
this is species here.

409
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,936
If you care, it's named
<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> .

410
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,939
It increases the levels
of endocannabinoids

411
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,774
that you make in your intestine.

412
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,844
So there is a cross talk
in there.

413
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,379
And how does this work?

414
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,581
I told you,
epinephrine/norepinephrine

415
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,317
are stress neurotransmitters,
okay?

416
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,985
They stress you.

417
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,454
Endocannabinoids are calming,

418
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,223
and they act through the
same receptor

419
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,893
as epinephrine/norepinephrine
in the bacterial cells.

420
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,762
I told you,
epinephrine/norepinephrine

421
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,799
will activate the QseC
to start a virulence program

422
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,569
in many bacterial pathogens.

423
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,071
Endocannabinoids,
such as 2-AG,

424
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,941
will prevent this
from being activated.

425
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,143
It will actually inhibit it.

426
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,580
And that will stop
the virulence programs.

427
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,982
So they are antagonistic
to each other

428
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,018
even though they work through
the same bacterial receptor.

429
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,820
And what's interesting is that

430
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,923
in mammalian systems,
epinephrine/norepinephrine

431
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,492
and endocannabinoid signal
in the intestine,

432
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,628
they have opposing functions.

433
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,464
Epinephrine/norepinephrine
increase intestinal motility,

434
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,733
inflammation, and stress.

435
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,903
And endocannabinoids
decrease motility, inflammation,

436
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,040
and of course,
it decreases the stress too.

437
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:10,444
And how can we think about this
in a therapeutic way?

438
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,614
Okay,
you have plant cannabinoids.

439
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,650
One of them, cannabidiol CBD,
seems to be,

440
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:21,388
according to the press,
the cure for everything.

441
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:25,726
But it is used sometimes
to alleviate colitis.

442
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:29,730
And the beauty of CBD
is it is FDA approved

443
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,734
and considered safe to be even,
to be used even in children

444
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,703
that are two years of age
or older.

445
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,141
So I'm gonna go
to the last system

446
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,044
that we work with on this
interkingdom interactions,

447
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,079
and that's also a calming one.

448
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:51,218
This one involves serotonin,
your feel-good neurotransmitter,

449
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:55,489
and a bacterial signal that
Maggie alluded to, indole,

450
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:58,859
that's made by the
human microbiota in the gut.

451
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,027
Okay.

452
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,195
The way this works is,

453
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,697
first of all,
serotonin makes you feel good,

454
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,900
but 95% of that
is made in your gut.

455
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,538
And the way this works
is there is the sensor kinase.

456
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,508
This one has a different name,
a different receptor.

457
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,210
It's called CpxA.

458
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,713
This is usually activating
bacterial virulence.

459
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,419
However, when serotonin
or indole binds to this kinase,

460
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,488
what they do
is they shut it down.

461
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,757
And when they shut it down,

462
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:35,495
they shut down virulence
in bacterial pathogens.

463
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:39,166
So it's opposing functions
to the adrenergic signaling

464
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:40,734
that I just told you about.

465
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,769
Similar
to the endocannabinoid one,

466
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,973
but working
through a different receptor.

467
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,474
And why do we care?

468
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,878
First of all, serotonin is
something that people take.

469
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,513
And serotonin agonists

470
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,082
can actually alleviate
enteric disease.

471
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,352
You can use drugs
that are used for something else

472
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,020
and probably adapt them

473
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,890
to use for treating
infectious diseases.

474
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:08,428
Also, Prozac inhibits serotonin
reuptake from your gut.

475
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,198
So what happens is
when you take Prozac,

476
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,934
you accumulate serotonin
in the gut,

477
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:17,271
and at least mice
in these conditions

478
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,307
become less susceptible
to enteric infections

479
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,776
by bad pathogens
such as <i>E. coli.</i>

480
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,945
If you like Quarter Pounders
from McDonald's,

481
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,447
you probably know what
I'm talking about,

482
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,784
salmonella
and so forth and so on.

483
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,186
And finally,

484
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:35,656
this does not just play
a role in infectious diseases,

485
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:39,660
but it also plays a role
in addiction behaviors.

486
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:43,497
So what we have been studying
in the lab for a while now

487
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:46,333
is that people
who are addicted to cocaine.

488
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,135
So when you give cocaine
to mice,

489
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,838
because we do everything
in mice, okay,

490
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:54,174
what happens is cocaine
is a psychoactive drug

491
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:57,377
because it makes
you accumulate norepinephrine.

492
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,379
So you keep firing.

493
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,981
And that's
why people are always excited

494
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,850
when they are on cocaine.

495
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,718
And when that happens,
norepinephrine,

496
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,953
as I mentioned,

497
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:09,590
is sensed by the sensor
here in bacterial cells.

498
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:13,694
And <i>E. coli,</i> part of your
commensal microbiota, has those.

499
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,097
And when this happens here,
you have cocaine.

500
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,366
A lot of norepinephrine
is released.

501
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,368
It's sensed by bacteria
in the gut.

502
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:24,505
And <i>E. coli</i> expands,
it blooms.

503
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,640
Usually you have
very few <i>E. coli.</i>

504
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,809
Now you have a lot of <i>E. coli.</i>

505
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,677
And when you have a lot
of <i>E. coli,</i>

506
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:34,414
<i>E. coli</i> likes to use glycine,
which is an amino acid,

507
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,218
as a nitrogen source,
as a food source.

508
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:41,722
And that causes the glycine
levels to drop in the gut.

509
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,725
And they also will drop
in the brain.

510
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,094
And glycine is actually
in the brain,

511
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,264
a ligand, okay,
that activates the systems

512
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,000
that prevents you
from being addicted

513
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,702
to psychoactive drugs
like cocaine.

514
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,039
So when you have
this situation here

515
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,476
with a lot of <i>E. coli,</i>
drops in glycine,

516
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,044
this doesn't activate.

517
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:07,447
There is increased
cocaine addiction behaviors.

518
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:10,184
Just for you to have an idea
of what I'm talking about,

519
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,153
we give cocaine to mice
with and without <i>E. coli.</i>

520
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,190
So, and look at them,
it's labeled.

521
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:17,991
But I don't think
I need to tell you

522
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:19,393
which animals are on cocaine
here, right?

523
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,196
It's pretty obvious.
[audience laughing]

524
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:26,600
So it's fun to see mice
on cocaine running around,

525
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,570
but as a scientist,
need some numbers.

526
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:32,806
So what we do,
we have these boxes

527
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,808
and they have lasers in them.

528
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,111
So when the animals run around,
they cut the lasers.

529
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:41,682
And then that tells the computer
when they cut them.

530
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:45,052
And that measures how much
they run and how they run.

531
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:47,788
And then you can get graphs
that we scientists like.

532
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,390
Okay,
so here we don't care.

533
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,559
These mice never got
any cocaine.

534
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,561
They're boring, okay?

535
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:57,531
Now, if you have mice
that have a microbiota

536
00:24:57,598 --> 00:25:00,634
that has no <i>E. coli</i> in it,
they respond to cocaine.

537
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:03,704
This means that they're
running around more, okay?

538
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,873
But it's a regular response.

539
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:09,409
However, here in blue
and in green,

540
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:13,947
if they have a lot of <i>E. coli</i>
in their microbiota now,

541
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:18,852
they have enhanced behaviors
and they run like crazy.

542
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,721
So in summary here,

543
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,490
cocaine exposure increases
norepinephrine.

544
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,226
The gut that leads
to a Proteobacteria,

545
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:27,961
an <i>E. coli</i> bloom.

546
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:31,899
Proteobacteria used glycine
as a nitrogen source,

547
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,269
decreasing its levels in the gut
and in the brain.

548
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:40,674
That prevents glycine from
activating the signaling system

549
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:42,209
that prevents addiction.

550
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:43,911
So what it ends up doing

551
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:47,548
is that you get
these animals to become

552
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,484
more susceptible
to cocaine.

553
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:55,789
And you can fix this by giving
glycine back to mice, okay?

554
00:25:56,657 --> 00:26:01,094
And we wonder now what
other members of the microbiota

555
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:04,831
do to sensitization
to drugs such as cocaine.

556
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,266
We know what <i>E. coli</i> does.

557
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,868
We don't know what
the other ones do.

558
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,404
There is a lot of wealth
of microbes in there,

559
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,905
and it opens the door

560
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:15,809
for the manipulation of
intestinal bacterial processes

561
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,377
to be therapeutic targets

562
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:20,981
to impact the course
of substance use disorders.

563
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:23,016
So what I told you today

564
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,520
is that the gut has a wealth
of neurotransmitters in them.

565
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,623
And microbes,
both members of the microbiota

566
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,694
and also pathogens in the gut
are exposed to them.

567
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,530
They have sensors
for these neurotransmitters,

568
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:41,068
and usually the sensing is tied
with interkingdom signaling,

569
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:44,037
sensing of other
bacterial signals, too,

570
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,840
because they're
chemically structured

571
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:49,343
very similar to each other.

572
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,213
So they kind of learn
how to see each other.

573
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,916
And manipulation
of the signaling systems

574
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:58,552
can lead to novel
therapeutic strategies,

575
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,787
not just
for infectious diseases,

576
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:04,324
but also to treat
substance use disorders.

577
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:07,394
And I'll finish here with the
people who actually do the job,

578
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,730
which are the young people
in the lab

579
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,866
who work very passionately
about,

580
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,102
towards their science
to get with

581
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,037
all of these ideas together.

582
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,605
So, thank you.

583
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:20,908
[audience applauding]

584
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,751
- Margaret: All right,
So I'm gonna pepper Vanessa

585
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:31,919
with some questions.

586
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,454
And we'll have
a little bit of a discussion.

587
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:38,825
And then we'll open it up
for some Q&A from the audience.

588
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:40,794
Vanessa, I always have
this question I feel like

589
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,664
when I hear the cocaine story.

590
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,499
Which is, you know,

591
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:48,602
thinking about maybe coming
at this from a,

592
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,537
you know,
a microbe's perspective,

593
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:52,206
where if you're <i>E. coli</i>

594
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:56,310
and you're expanding
when you're exposed to cocaine,

595
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,378
and then you're altering
the host's behavior

596
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,180
to enforce that addiction,

597
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,717
is this just a giant ploy
of the microbe

598
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:07,855
for increasing its fitness
by altering host behavior?

599
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:11,458
And do you know
of any other examples of that?

600
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:15,195
- Vanessa: So they're
not too many examples

601
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,097
that got to the mechanism
of things.

602
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,265
- Margaret: Mm-hmm.

603
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:22,803
- Okay, but there are
very complex interactions

604
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:27,174
between composition
of the microbiota

605
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:32,579
and expansion of certain members
with opioid addiction.

606
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,948
They don't,
they didn't get all the way

607
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,417
to the mechanism
and the ins and outs of that.

608
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:41,588
But it has been looked at,
at opioid addiction,

609
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,557
alcohol addiction.

610
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:45,626
- Margaret: Yeah.

611
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:47,361
- And, um...

612
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:52,733
I'm not sure if they actually
looked to much of the microbiota

613
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,602
in people who smoke a lot
of marijuana,

614
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:58,705
but at least with opioids
they did.

615
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:03,777
And with psychoactive drugs
like cocaine, there is.

616
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:04,945
- Margaret: Gotcha.

617
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:06,146
And I think, remind me too

618
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,582
of the mechanism
of the glycine.

619
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,084
So <i>E. coli</i>
is decreasing glycine.

620
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:14,521
And then how is that feeding
into the behavioral change?

621
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,257
- So the way this happens
is <i>E. coli</i>

622
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:19,359
eats the glycine, right?
- Yeah.

623
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,229
- Your cells want glycine, so.

624
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,766
That decreases the level
in the gut.

625
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,167
That goes systemically,

626
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,102
decreases the level
of glycine in the whole body,

627
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,305
including in the brain.

628
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:34,208
And glycine is actually a ligand

629
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,177
for this receptor
in the brain,

630
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,480
for a pathway
that controls addiction.

631
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:44,785
Not only addiction,
but also schizophrenia.

632
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:48,856
Because apparently
it's involved in both.

633
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:52,726
And when that signaling
doesn't happen,

634
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:56,230
you get less protected
against developing

635
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,998
an addiction behavior.

636
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:00,400
- Margaret: Gotcha,
super, super fascinating.

637
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:04,071
I guess I think of this, too,
in the context of, you know,

638
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,808
microbes influencing
host behavior with diet,

639
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,976
and this, I, you know,

640
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,577
I don't think there's
that much out there,

641
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:12,579
but one of the, like,
sort of out there ideas

642
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:15,015
that I have been wondering
about is if,

643
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:18,285
you know, a diet can
sort of shape a host's behavior

644
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,354
in terms of dietary preferences.

645
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,855
There's actually
this paper recently

646
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:26,727
that was a knockout
of a fatty acid sensor molecule,

647
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:30,430
and they saw a change in the
microbiota and then a change

648
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:33,333
in, like, the sugar preferences
of mice based on that.

649
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,202
And it's always interesting
to me to think about

650
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:38,805
that if there's, you know,
some sort of connection back to,

651
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,507
you know,
the fitness of the microbes

652
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:42,176
based on those
sugar preferences.

653
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,578
And I don't remember if
they got around to that or not,

654
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:45,746
but it's something.

655
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:47,948
- Vanessa:
So there is a tie-in with diet.

656
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,550
I didn't get time to go to that,

657
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,785
but I mentioned
briefly that

658
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:55,656
you can fix this whole problem
just by giving glycine

659
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:56,823
to these animals.

660
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,892
You can correct that.

661
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,497
And it turns out that glycine
is made out of this compound

662
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:04,698
called sarcosine.

663
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:06,834
It's the direct precursor.

664
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,471
And you can fix the behavior too
if you give sarcosine.

665
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:15,676
And sarcosine, for anybody
who goes to the gym a lot

666
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,978
or work out a lot,
or athlete,

667
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:22,616
is used very commonly as a
dietary supplement by athletes.

668
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:25,919
You can go to GNC
and buy sarcosine.

669
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,289
And that basically
immediately turns into glycine

670
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,291
and fixes the behavior.

671
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:34,895
So that there is some tie-in
with diet.

672
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:37,097
And this is obviously
in the very beginning.

673
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:40,300
So we have a lot of ground
to cover.

674
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,171
- Margaret: Definitely.

675
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,806
I think one of the questions

676
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:48,041
I've always wanted
to talk to you about is sort of,

677
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:51,478
do you have any out-there
ideas in terms of microbiota,

678
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:57,017
you know, gut-immune-brain axis
that you've wanted to look into

679
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,653
and haven't had the chance
to do?

680
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,924
- Vanessa: Yes, because there is
a very strong,

681
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:07,094
people are seeing
a lot of correlations

682
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,732
between inflammation
and different behaviors.

683
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,905
You know, you have things
like that happening with autism.

684
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:21,441
Autism, I think, is the one that
people look the most at.

685
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:23,510
Alzheimer's, right?

686
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,846
In our case here,

687
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:27,481
it doesn't seem to be
inflammation.

688
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:28,982
We did look at inflammation.

689
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,118
It wasn't the inflammatory
process, but...

690
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,386
- Margaret: So sorry.

691
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,155
- Which was what we thought
was gonna happen first...

692
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:38,025
[both laugh]
...to be quite honest with you.

693
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:40,661
But with other
neurodegenerative diseases,

694
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:44,298
the connection
between inflammation,

695
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,200
especially with dysbiosis,

696
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,635
changes in the microbiota
to get a microbiota

697
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,938
that's pro-inflammatory.

698
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:52,172
- Margaret: Yeah.
- Okay.

699
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:55,342
That tends to affect
a lot of behaviors.

700
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:00,214
There's also a lot of work
coming out on depression.

701
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:02,950
- Margaret: Yeah,
'cause that's something

702
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:04,151
I think a lot about too,

703
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,953
is we haven't
sort of gone into this realm,

704
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,120
but there's, you know,

705
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:08,722
the immune cells
that we're looking at

706
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:09,890
in multiple sclerosis.

707
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:12,559
There are some ideas
that these Th17 cells

708
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,561
can have
an impact in depression.

709
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:17,965
And if we, you know,
modulate that interaction

710
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:20,534
between the microbiota
and those cells with diet,

711
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:23,837
you know, can you try and,
you know?

712
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:26,006
- Vanessa:
Yeah, you probably can.

713
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:29,376
Because as you know,
when you change the diet,

714
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:31,211
you change the composition,
right?

715
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,517
So if it's a plant-based diet
or a ketogenic diet, or,

716
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,953
or a Western diet that's
you know, full of carbo--

717
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,421
processed carbohydrates,

718
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:44,224
you have
very different microbiotas.

719
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,293
And, unfortunately,

720
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:52,499
the Western diet seems to be
the most pro-inflammatory one.

721
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:53,934
- Margaret: But my problem too,

722
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:56,436
is, you know, trying to study,
you know,

723
00:33:56,503 --> 00:33:59,540
behavioral conditions
like depression,

724
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,141
it's, how do you model
that in mice?

725
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,543
Because as you
probably both appreciate it,

726
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,777
we're both working in mice.

727
00:34:03,844 --> 00:34:07,614
And so how do you assess
if a mouse is depressed?

728
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:09,283
[Vanessa laughing]
I don't know the answer.

729
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,585
I know people are working
on that,

730
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:14,488
but I think it's an
interesting...

731
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,457
- There are mouse models,
okay?

732
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:22,162
The same way there
are mouse models for autism.

733
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,764
- Margaret: Mm-hmm.
- Vanessa: Okay?

734
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,633
But I'm not a neuroscientist,

735
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:30,137
okay,
I'm a microbiologist.

736
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,805
But what a neuroscientist
is gonna tell you

737
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:34,241
is that you cannot rely
on just one model.

738
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:36,543
You have to use many of them.

739
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,978
I showed you, for example,

740
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:41,615
for the addiction studies
that we did,

741
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,617
I showed you just locomotion,

742
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:46,119
but that's, like,
the starter model.

743
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:47,988
Okay, the easy one.

744
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:51,024
Then you have
drug-seeking behavior

745
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,894
on, like, do they seek
the drug more.

746
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,062
And the answer, yes.

747
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,998
And there are models
for that, like,

748
00:34:58,065 --> 00:35:02,202
different types of boxes, okay,
where they go.

749
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,571
You just give drug to them
in one type of box.

750
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:07,074
Normally, they would spend
the same time in both.

751
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,843
But do they develop
a preference now to the one

752
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,311
where they get the drug?

753
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:13,881
And there's also
self-administration,

754
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,950
which it's easier to do
with rats

755
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:21,121
because they're bigger
and they're,

756
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,790
they're way smarter
than mice, so...

757
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:25,526
[laughing]
They are.

758
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:27,528
So you can train them
much better.

759
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,263
With mice,
usually you just train

760
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,432
about 50% of them
to press the lever

761
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,135
so then you can do
the behaviors.

762
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:39,106
With rats, you can actually
train many of those.

763
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:42,576
And, of course,
extremely expensive

764
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,445
and very, very difficult to do

765
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:48,715
would be with monkeys,
with primates.

766
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,854
- Margaret: So I think you had
an example today of sort of

767
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:58,659
how signals from the microbiota
get sensed in the brain,

768
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,661
which is actually really
interesting to me because I,

769
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:01,828
you know, I think about,

770
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,497
you know, how,
what are the ways

771
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:08,168
in which changes in your gut
can influence the brain.

772
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:09,703
And I was wondering if you,

773
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,472
you had any other examples
of sort of this, this,

774
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:15,075
you know, the signals
being sensed in the brain.

775
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:16,677
One of the things
I think about is,

776
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:18,278
is it the signal
that's reaching the brain,

777
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,446
or are there changes happening,

778
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,248
sort of the immune response
in the gut

779
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:23,650
that then traffic to the brain
and trying to figure out

780
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:26,954
which one of those things
might be.

781
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:33,393
- Vanessa: So we have something
very preliminary on that, okay?

782
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,928
And that's with indole,

783
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:38,565
which is strictly a microbial
signal made in the gut,

784
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:40,067
not in the brain.
- Margaret: Yeah.

785
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:45,339
- And if you do metabolomics
in the brain of mice, okay,

786
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,875
you can actually find indole
in there.

787
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,042
So some of--

788
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,277
- Margaret: How much indole,
though?

789
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:52,012
- Ah.

790
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:55,816
That, with cerebrospinal fluid
from mice, is hard to measure.

791
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,351
[both laughing]
But--

792
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,952
- Margaret: I'll ask you
in a year.

793
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,255
- Yeah, but you can
actually find indole in there,

794
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,290
so somehow it travels.

795
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:06,460
I'm assuming it goes through
the, through the blood,

796
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:11,198
because with the whole thing
with glycine levels.

797
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,369
- Margaret: Yeah.
- It's through the blood.

798
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:16,970
It's systemic.

799
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:19,139
So I'm assuming
that it's just going systemic

800
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,474
through the blood.

801
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,476
- Which can happen, I guess,
for these small molecules.

802
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:25,746
I mean, you guys saw
the indole is only

803
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:28,382
less than 12 carbons,
I guess.

804
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,550
I can't remember.

805
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:31,151
I'm trying to map it out in my--

806
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:32,553
But, you know,
a very small thing.

807
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,154
And so I'm wondering if there's,
you know,

808
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:37,424
bigger things that it's more
difficult to reach the brain

809
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:39,626
than you have to have things
that change,

810
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:41,562
you know, maybe to the
enteric nervous system

811
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:44,164
that then feed into the brain
as another way

812
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:47,134
that those things
that quite can't get systemic

813
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,369
can influence the...

814
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,306
- Yeah, I'm not sure if, like,
big fatty acids would make it.

815
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:53,740
Right?
- Yeah, right?

816
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:56,810
- Those I think would have
some trouble going there.

817
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:58,545
- Margaret: I would think so
too, but...

818
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,614
- But a lot
of the signals are very small,

819
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,516
and some of them
are modified versions

820
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,819
of amino acids
or catecholamines,

821
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,989
which are also pretty tiny.

822
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:13,861
So it all depends on the type
of signal that you have.

823
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:16,330
- And I guess maybe
I'll ask one final question

824
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:19,566
of thinking about, like,
how reversible these things are.

825
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:23,437
So this, you know, cocaine
increasing <i>E. coli</i> levels

826
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,472
that are sort of feeding
into the cycle.

827
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,007
How reversible is that?

828
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:31,545
If you stop this and still have
that increase of <i>E. coli</i>

829
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:33,580
and you sort of let it,
the mice try

830
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,283
and equilibrate
for a couple of weeks.

831
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,620
Do they still have that
addiction,

832
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:42,556
or can you sort of get
to a point

833
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:45,259
where that no longer
is the case?

834
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,028
- Amazingly enough,
whatever happens in there

835
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:51,431
seems to have
a long-lasting effect.

836
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,501
So my former postdoc,
Santiago Cuesta,

837
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:56,203
who did the studies then

838
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,039
is continuing those
in his laboratory

839
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:02,743
at Rutgers University,
he actually looked at relapse.

840
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,779
- Margaret: Mm-hmm.
- And of course,

841
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:09,683
after you stop and give it
a long time without the drug,

842
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,986
the microbiota gets to normal
with everything again

843
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:16,623
and you wait enough,
what would be long enough

844
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,760
for a mouse to expose them
to cocaine again,

845
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,196
and they relapse much more
than the ones

846
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:24,398
who never got this process
to begin with.

847
00:39:24,464 --> 00:39:26,533
- Margaret: Yeah.
- Why?

848
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:29,403
We don't know.

849
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:34,474
But whatever modification
is happening, they relapse too.

850
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,109
- Margaret:
Very, very interesting.

851
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:41,148
Well, I want to now open it up
to the audience for Q&A.

852
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:42,816
If you would raise your hand,

853
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:44,852
we'll have people come around
with microphones

854
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:47,721
so that people online
can hear as well.

855
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,456
So any questions?

856
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:56,930
- Attendee 1: Hi, thank you.

857
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:58,565
Those were two
great presentations.

858
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,934
I have a question for you.
[chuckling]

859
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:03,003
Um, yeah.
[chuckling]

860
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,074
About your work
with the autoimmune system

861
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:08,775
in your mouse model.

862
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,244
So where does--

863
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,179
Since these mice are in a
very controlled environment,

864
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,948
where does the microbiome
for these mice come from?

865
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:16,316
- Margaret:
It's a great question.

866
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,985
So in our mouse facilities,

867
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:19,853
there's a couple
of different levels

868
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,423
of definitions of
microbial communities, I'll say.

869
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,693
So one is germ-free,
so no microbes.

870
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,795
And the other is
specific pathogen-free,

871
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:33,033
which is, they're sort of
tracked for different pathogens.

872
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,868
And we want to exclude
those pathogens

873
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:37,304
because we're trying
to have a mouse colony

874
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:39,606
that is not constantly
undergoing infection.

875
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:41,441
That influences
our immune responses,

876
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:44,511
that confuses all
of our experimental systems.

877
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:46,346
And that's the sort of system
that we work.

878
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:51,118
So it's not sort of,
it's a non-diseased, I guess,

879
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,754
or non-infection microbes.

880
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,656
Now, this is a
really interesting question

881
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:57,791
because there's sort of
different levels of this.

882
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,393
So you can screen
for many pathogens.

883
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,995
You can screen for a subset
of pathogens.

884
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:06,500
And so there's different levels
of that specific pathogen free.

885
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,771
And the other sort of side
of this is more dirty mice,

886
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,339
which are actually termed
dirty mice

887
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,608
because it's, like, some people
use pet store mice

888
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:16,743
or mice
that are captured in the wild

889
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,312
and try and colonize,
you know,

890
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:19,913
these mice
that we use in the lab

891
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,316
with those microbial communities

892
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:23,717
to try and better model,
you know,

893
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,085
what we're all experiencing,

894
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:28,255
which we obviously are exposed
to pathogens in our lives.

895
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,791
And so, how does that impact
this, you know,

896
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,026
cross talk between microbes
and immune system,

897
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:37,364
if you've had this sort
of exposure to pathogens.

898
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:39,499
And this is actually
something really interesting

899
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:42,903
to think about too, when you're
thinking about immune responses,

900
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,339
you know,
how does that differ based on

901
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:47,774
if you've been exposed
to pathogens or not?

902
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,544
So I kind of went off
on a tangent there,

903
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,713
but I think it's a
really interesting question of,

904
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:55,382
sort of what are
these background microbiotas.

905
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:58,685
And it might change
your response very differently

906
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:01,321
depending on what
that background microbiota is.

907
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:05,459
So let's say I have a microbiota
and my twin, which I don't have,

908
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:08,662
we'll pretend my twin has
a different microbiota.

909
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,964
We both eat the same diet.

910
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,900
We might have
different responses to that diet

911
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:17,538
based on the background
microbiota that existed in us.

912
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:18,705
Yeah.

913
00:42:18,772 --> 00:42:20,440
Great question.

914
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,177
- Attendee 2:
I had a question regarding

915
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:27,080
how the diet influences
autoimmune diseases.

916
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,183
And based on your diagram,

917
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:33,253
you had BHB and then
that influences the microbiome,

918
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,889
and then that triggers
this small molecule.

919
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:38,192
And how do you identify,

920
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,628
like, these different types
of checkpoints and, like,

921
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,630
are they already known
prior to, like,

922
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,199
formulating
your research questions

923
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:47,434
and, like,
what challenges you have,

924
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:50,170
if maybe those checkpoints
and that map,

925
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:51,805
like the figure you showed,

926
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:53,807
aren't necessarily
so clearly defined?

927
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,676
'Cause I know you're
also doing this in mice

928
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,945
and it's a lot of moving parts.

929
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,447
So it's kind of
a broad question.

930
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:01,849
- Margaret: Yeah,
it's sort of like,

931
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:04,651
how do we formulate
the questions

932
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:07,054
that we are trying to answer,

933
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,756
of like, why did we initially
look at, you know,

934
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:12,426
beta hydroxybutyrate
and ketogenesis,

935
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:14,528
which was all based on,
you know, as,

936
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,264
as people say, we build
on the backs of giants, right?

937
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:20,167
We know all of this,
all of these changes

938
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:22,636
that happen in response
to this diet on the host side.

939
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:25,005
And so can we use
that previous information

940
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:28,075
to sort of think about, okay,
what is a likely way

941
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:30,744
in which this is mediating
a response

942
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:32,279
in the context
that we're looking at?

943
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:34,081
And so, that's one thing
that we can do

944
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:35,249
is sort of take advantage

945
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:36,850
of all of the work
that has done,

946
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:39,453
been done before to come up
with these more targeted

947
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,423
and informed hypotheses
to then go test.

948
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,425
In addition, what is known
in the literature

949
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:49,897
is that the diet can profoundly
impact the composition

950
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,332
and the function
of the microbiota.

951
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:54,268
And so that's a big thing
to know.

952
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:56,203
Thinking about why
did we look at the microbiota

953
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,771
in the first place?

954
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,107
That is something that
sort of builds on that.

955
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:02,276
But then too, thinking about
the specific microbes

956
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:04,645
that we go after
and those metabolites,

957
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:06,680
that is also looking into,
you know,

958
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:09,716
what has been done previously,
where people had seen

959
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:13,053
that the <i>Lactobacillus</i>
can have a protective effect

960
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,055
in a mouse model
of multiple sclerosis.

961
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,590
And so using that information,

962
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:19,526
we can say, "Oh, we saw
an increase in <i>Lactobacillus.</i>

963
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:22,829
Maybe that is also explaining
our phenotypes."

964
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:24,831
And then we can sort of build
off of that

965
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:27,034
and see what else is known
about those interactions

966
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,202
in the literature

967
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:30,938
to get at those bioactive
microbial metabolites

968
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,372
to test those as well.

969
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:34,641
So it's trying to synthesize
all of this,

970
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,710
you know,
background information

971
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:39,546
and string it together
to sort of make sense

972
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:42,883
of this bigger-picture question
of how does a diet

973
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,219
impact a autoimmune condition?

974
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:46,954
Yeah.

975
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:50,424
- Attendee 3: One that I
was definitely thinking about,

976
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,626
and I mean, in a way,
like we talk about like,

977
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,228
"Oh, yeah,
this was done in a lab

978
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:55,562
"with, like, controlled mice.

979
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,698
And then how does
this translate into people?"

980
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:59,600
I mean, one of the things
that, like,

981
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:01,468
your experimental procedure
about, like,

982
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:04,938
oh, you have these
like, mice with no microbiome.

983
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:07,541
It feels a lot
in some ways to, like,

984
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:09,276
if you're about to go
get surgery

985
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:13,046
and you have to take, like,
a broad-spectrum antibiotic

986
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:16,216
for a long time specifically
to prevent, you know,

987
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,684
other types of infections.

988
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:20,354
But now maybe you've totally
cleared the board

989
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,022
on your own microbiome.

990
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:25,459
Is, so in that situation,
is there, like, a,

991
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:27,494
whether this exists
or maybe something

992
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:30,264
that you would like to dream up,
like,

993
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:33,200
if you had a chance
to build your own

994
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,969
best microbiome, like,
boo, <i>E coli.</i>

995
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:37,404
Yay, <i>Lactobacillus.</i>
[Vanessa laughing]

996
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,773
Like, are there things that,

997
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,609
like, practices like that
today or, like, things

998
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:47,214
that are working towards, like,
clinical applications like that?

999
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,815
- Vanessa:
Well, I can take this one.

1000
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:50,551
So actually...

1001
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:54,488
There is treatments
like that,

1002
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:56,924
and people are looking
very seriously into that

1003
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,728
for people who get infected with
<i>Clostridium difficile</i> , okay?

1004
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:05,265
Especially if you go through
broad spectrum antibiotics

1005
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:06,967
for a very long time,

1006
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:10,137
<i>Clostridium</i> takes over
and it can cause necrosis.

1007
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:12,372
And if you keep trying
to kill it with antibiotics,

1008
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:15,409
you just make things worse
because it doesn't repopulate.

1009
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:17,144
So with all of the other species

1010
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:20,914
that control that one
and keep it in check.

1011
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:26,320
So the really efficient
treatment is stool replacement.

1012
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:30,557
So I'm not making that up.

1013
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:34,695
So you have, it can either
go through an enema,

1014
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:38,165
or they have capsules
that you ingest.

1015
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:41,268
And they get basically
stool donation

1016
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:43,670
from very healthy donors

1017
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:48,041
to repopulate your intestine
with a good microbiota

1018
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:51,745
that's gonna get rid
of that pathogen for you.

1019
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:52,913
And of course,

1020
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,550
nobody wants to hear about
stool replacements,

1021
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:58,752
especially patients.

1022
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:01,188
So there is a lot of work

1023
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:04,691
being done on trying to figure
out which are the members

1024
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:08,795
of this microbiota that can
actually take care of business

1025
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:12,099
and try to make
synthetic microbiotas

1026
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,134
with these specific members.

1027
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,337
So you would have something
more defined,

1028
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:19,072
especially because,
you know,

1029
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,842
FDA is not a huge fan
of, like, just giving stool

1030
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,777
from one person to another,
but.

1031
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,779
- Margaret: And how do you
define healthy, too, right?

1032
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:27,581
- Vanessa: Yes, and how do you
define healthy.

1033
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:29,683
- Margaret: Yeah.
- Vanessa: So in desperate,

1034
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,918
it's a desperate measure,

1035
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:34,888
and it's one that's worked,
and it is used.

1036
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,558
But the effort in science

1037
00:47:37,624 --> 00:47:41,361
is towards defining what
would be your best microbiota

1038
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:43,096
to get rid of this.

1039
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:46,200
- Margaret: And too, I'll just
add on a little bit to that

1040
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:48,202
of like, you know,
how do you define that for,

1041
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,504
for this case
of <i>C. difficile</i> infection,

1042
00:47:50,571 --> 00:47:53,941
it might be different than the
case of an autoimmune condition.

1043
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:57,945
And so your
optimal synthetic microbiota

1044
00:47:58,011 --> 00:48:03,483
or even microbial metabolites
is going to differ between,

1045
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:06,220
you know,
what context you're trying

1046
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:08,856
to deliver that therapy in.

1047
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:11,024
And so trying
to figure out exactly

1048
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:13,160
how these things are working
is gonna help us,

1049
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,330
you know,
get that best community

1050
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,199
for that exact context,
yeah.

1051
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,569
- Attendee 4: I just wondered
if both of you

1052
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:25,339
could answer this question
about what do you see

1053
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,574
on the horizon as far as ways

1054
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:32,212
that your research could
go to develop this further?

1055
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,583
- Vanessa: So in our case,

1056
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,886
one of the things
that people are not,

1057
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:41,488
which is going to be the
next crisis we're gonna have,

1058
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:46,126
okay, it's antimicrobial
resistance to antibiotics.

1059
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:50,197
And pretty much, there
is resistance to everything

1060
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,165
there is in the market, okay.

1061
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:55,035
Because they develop
resistance really, really fast.

1062
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:59,006
And we have to find new ways
to develop them

1063
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,109
and trying to adopt drugs.

1064
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:05,979
And it's not just me,

1065
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:10,117
but a lot of people
work with the microbiome,

1066
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:14,855
they're looking into screening
FDA-approved drugs to see

1067
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:16,757
if they can be used
in the context

1068
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:20,294
in which they can control
bacterial infections,

1069
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,529
because people tend
to think about antibiotics like,

1070
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:24,565
"Ah, okay,
I take this for a week.

1071
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,767
I'm good, it's done."

1072
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:30,437
But modern medicine cannot exist
without something like that.

1073
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:32,105
You cannot go have surgery.

1074
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:35,876
You cannot take your wisdom
tooth without antibiotics.

1075
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:38,345
We have modern medicine
because of that.

1076
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:41,048
So we have to work
diligently in ways

1077
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:43,217
in which
we can address this crisis.

1078
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:46,720
And if you have drugs
that are already FDA-approved

1079
00:49:46,787 --> 00:49:49,656
that work and you know
how they work,

1080
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:52,492
you have all of the safety
on them already done.

1081
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,764
So it can be adapted much faster
than developing a new one.

1082
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:03,770
- I, sorry, I have a thought
based on sort of your talk too,

1083
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:07,407
of, like, the you know,
the word antibiotics is anti.

1084
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,977
And, like, you are killing
the microbes with that.

1085
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:12,579
But Vanessa, you know,
her research showed

1086
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:15,082
that you don't
have to kill something

1087
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,383
to stop its virulence.

1088
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,151
And so that's another area,
I think,

1089
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:21,455
that we can expand
this sort of antibiotic

1090
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:25,125
but anti-virulence research
into.

1091
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:27,761
It's not just targeting
killing the microbes,

1092
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:30,430
but targeting how
they're actually carrying out

1093
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:32,833
that virulent activity,

1094
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:37,905
which is probably easier
than eradicating a microbe

1095
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:40,040
from a population
in the first place.

1096
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:41,842
We have done some things

1097
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:44,211
looking at
IBD-associated microbes

1098
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:47,614
and having increased levels
of arginine in the diet

1099
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:50,817
can sort of both stop
that microbe

1100
00:50:51,652 --> 00:50:54,855
from activating an immune
response associated with IBD,

1101
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:58,125
but also is helpful
for that microbe to grow.

1102
00:50:58,192 --> 00:51:00,093
And so it's really interesting
that you might actually,

1103
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,896
if you're helping
some microbe's growth,

1104
00:51:02,963 --> 00:51:06,233
it might actually prevent
its anti,

1105
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,170
you know,
pro-inflammatory response

1106
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:11,772
because maybe
it's doing better,

1107
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,173
and so it doesn't
have to activate

1108
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,076
those virulence pathways
to increase its fitness.

1109
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,744
So it's really
sort of counterintuitive,

1110
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:21,281
but it makes sense in some ways
of promoting growth

1111
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:23,083
to inhibit virulence.

1112
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,853
So it's a fascinating,
fascinating area.

1113
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,323
- Vanessa: And there is also a
very, a lot of very nice,

1114
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,725
beautiful data with MRSA

1115
00:51:33,026 --> 00:51:36,763
showing that these types
of strategies of disarming them

1116
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:40,901
without killing them actually
work really, really well.

1117
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:43,871
And there is
actually even data

1118
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,275
on patients who got

1119
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:52,346
vancomycin-resistant MRSA
infections and...

1120
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:55,382
Well, there's nothing anyone
can do about that normally.

1121
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:56,750
Right?

1122
00:51:56,817 --> 00:52:01,054
And in these types of cases,
they ended up being treated

1123
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:04,892
with this experimental type
of therapeutics,

1124
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,493
and they survived.

1125
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,030
It worked,
so the potential is there.

1126
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:15,002
And, you know,
I think in the field in general,

1127
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:17,638
we're all trying
to look towards ways,

1128
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:21,441
creative ways in which we can
expand armamentarium

1129
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,477
to combat diseases

1130
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:28,882
and also understand how to help
with behaviors and addiction

1131
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:31,451
and neurodegenerative diseases.

1132
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:33,954
Autism has a huge component

1133
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:38,492
that has to do with the
microbiota, for example.

1134
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:44,765
- Host: We have
a online question

1135
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:46,834
from the audience online.

1136
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,736
A member who's living
with colitis and asking,

1137
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:51,505
"Is there any hope for me?"

1138
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:53,473
[Vanessa laughing]

1139
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:55,709
- Vanessa:
Well, there is hope for you.

1140
00:52:55,776 --> 00:52:57,010
[laughing]

1141
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:58,979
So, so with colitis,

1142
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:05,385
you can interfere
with different diets, okay?

1143
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:09,790
So you can basically try to,
usually when you have colitis,

1144
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:12,292
you tend to have more <i>E. coli</i>
than you should,

1145
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,062
which is
kind of inflammatory in general.

1146
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:18,599
So if you can change your diet
for a plant-based diet,

1147
00:53:18,665 --> 00:53:23,437
you can increase a member of the
microbiota called bacteroidetes

1148
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:26,840
that breaks plant's
carbohydrates

1149
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,379
like pectin
and things of the sort.

1150
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:34,147
And they become the majority.

1151
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,183
And those are very good.

1152
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,886
They actually
prevent inflammation.

1153
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:42,723
So there are dietary
interventions that you can use.

1154
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:46,260
I'm not advertising
anything, but...

1155
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:51,331
That, you know, you can think
about maybe Prozac or...

1156
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:57,237
But this is not, this has
to go through clinical trials

1157
00:53:57,304 --> 00:54:00,274
because we are at the stage in
which this is tested in animals.

1158
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,142
Right, once it goes,

1159
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,211
once it jumps
from a mouse to a human being,

1160
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:07,080
it's a total different ballgame.

1161
00:54:12,186 --> 00:54:13,654
- Attendee 5: Thank you.
[clearing throat]

1162
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:19,560
So I was wondering what kind
of pathways and interactions

1163
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:23,397
between the microbiome
and blood-brain barrier

1164
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:27,801
and those connections to your
research regarding addictions

1165
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:30,204
and possibly depression
and anxiety,

1166
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,206
like, what have you found
regarding

1167
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,542
those biochemical pathways
and connections

1168
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,545
and their associations
with certain foods?

1169
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:40,981
And are there any specific foods

1170
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:43,217
or maybe substances
or supplements

1171
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,852
that you would
personally recommend

1172
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:47,387
based upon your research?

1173
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:52,326
- Vanessa: I'm cautious
about recommending supplements

1174
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:53,894
and diets, okay?

1175
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,197
Especially when you are
in a very early stage

1176
00:54:57,264 --> 00:54:59,032
still in animals.

1177
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,134
In animals,
I can say that at least

1178
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:04,238
for psychoactive addiction
to cocaine,

1179
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:07,774
sarcosine seems
to work okay in mice.

1180
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:15,249
But from a mouse to a human,
the jump there is the thing.

1181
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,718
So their literature
is beautiful.

1182
00:55:17,784 --> 00:55:21,588
And if you start going
to old literature,

1183
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,759
in the '70s,
there is this manuscript.

1184
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:28,929
Okay, that was done
in the University of Maryland

1185
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,531
by the Center
for Vaccine Development,

1186
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:33,901
and they were developing
vaccines against cholera,

1187
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:38,205
and they had
clinical trials of the vaccines.

1188
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,974
And at that time,

1189
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,643
they would have
the vaccinated people,

1190
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:46,513
the unvaccinated people
who were infected with cholera.

1191
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,681
Okay?

1192
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:50,984
And needless to say,
several of the volunteers

1193
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:53,854
who would volunteer
for that kind of study,

1194
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:56,924
a lot of them
have come from jail.

1195
00:55:57,624 --> 00:56:00,827
And they had, like,
their medical history.

1196
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:02,763
And one of the things
they noted

1197
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:05,732
was that heavy marijuana users

1198
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,403
were less susceptible
to cholera.

1199
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:15,142
There is, you know, it's one
of the things that they noticed.

1200
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,877
But...

1201
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:19,813
But it was never followed up,
right?

1202
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,449
Because everybody was like,
"Yeah, so what?"

1203
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:23,684
You know, but there is,

1204
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,185
there was
some sort of correlation,

1205
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:30,624
and it's a manuscript from
the 1975, something like that.

1206
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:36,263
It's old, but it seems like any
diet that plant-based diets,

1207
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:39,766
I would say or
Mediterranean diets are the ones

1208
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:44,738
who seem to, people seem
to think that are the best ones.

1209
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:46,273
- Margaret:
But I would say too,

1210
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,875
it's still not really known
how they're working.

1211
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:49,776
- Vanessa: Yeah.
- Margaret: And so, you know.

1212
00:56:49,843 --> 00:56:52,746
You might see
an average response

1213
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:53,914
to something over a population.

1214
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,382
But what does that mean for you?

1215
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:58,318
And thinking about sort of this
personalized medicine approach.

1216
00:56:58,385 --> 00:57:01,355
You know, can we get more
about understanding

1217
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,258
how exactly these things work,

1218
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:08,662
to more targetedly
get at those interactions?

1219
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:14,234
Yeah.

1220
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,837
Oh,
and I have got the signal

1221
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:19,640
that I think we are
at the end of the time.

1222
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:22,309
But I wanna thank you all
so very much

1223
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:24,778
for your amazing discussion
today.

1224
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:25,946
It was lovely.

1225
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,681
And thank you so much
to Dr. Sperandio

1226
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:30,417
for an inspiring conversation.

1227
00:57:30,484 --> 00:57:33,420
And thank you again so much
for joining us this evening.

1228
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:35,722
[audience applauding]
