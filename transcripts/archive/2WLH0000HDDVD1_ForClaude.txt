during the fog,

153
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,667
they were up there,
and they were doing it.

154
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,125
There's nothing unique
about the fact that I'm a woman.

155
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,792
<i>- But today, the historic
lighthouse still stands,</i>

156
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,999
<i>and Anna Marie Lux
 is the link</i>

157
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,999
<i>to those who have
 lived here before.</i>

158
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,709
<i>Consider the poem
by Edgar Guest:</i>

159
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,999
<i>[reciting
 The Lighthouse Keeper Wonders]
 "The light I've tended
 for 40 years</i>

160
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,750
<i>"is now to be run
 by a set of gears,</i>

161
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,208
<i>"but will ever
 that automatic thing</i>

162
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,417
<i>plant marigolds
in the spring?"</i>

163
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,999
<i>We don't know if marigolds
</i>nbloomed every summer since 1874

164
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:53,500
<i>on Outer Island.</i>

165
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,999
<i>But thanks to Anna Marie Lux,
 they did bloom this summer.</i>

166
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:01,999
- Anna Marie Lux:
I hope that,
in some small way,

167
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:07,875
I've been able to carry on
this romantic tradition.

<i>- The view of the sunset
 from here</i>

169
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,667
<i>lives up to the namesake
 of the lake: superior.</i>

170
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:16,709
<i>If there is a message in Anna
</i>nMarie's summer on Outer Island,

171
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,667
<i>it is this:</i>

172
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,875
<i>The sun
 rises and sets every day.</i>

173
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,041
<i>Take a few minutes
 and watch it.</i>

174
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,792
<i>You may not
 make a living at it,</i>

175
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,875
<i>but it will definitely
 leave you richer.</i>
