- Angela Fitzgerald:
I'm touring the State Archive
Preservation Facility,

3
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:06,083
meeting up
with Rachel Byington,

4
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,999
Tribal Liaison with the
Wisconsin Historical Society,

5
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:12,999
to learn more about
the Care Suite found here.

6
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,792
How are you doing today,
Rachel?

7
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,000
- I'm doing well, thank you.
- Good.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,083
Can you tell us about
the significance of this space

9
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:19,959
and how it came to be?

10
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,834
- Rachel Byington:
The Wisconsin Historical Society

11
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,999
collaborating
with Native Nations

12
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:24,999
to design this space

13
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,083
and really listening
to the Native Nations

14
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,999
on how
to make a space

15
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,083
that would be usable
for their needs.

16
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,500
- Angela: And so, this
was a collaborative process

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,625
between
Indigenous communities

18
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,709
and the Wisconsin
Historical Society?

19
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:37,792
- Yes, exactly.

20
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,583
People could come in here
and use the space

21
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,208
for ceremony or prayer
or consultations.

22
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:47,041
And so, any necessary ceremonial
or spiritual practices

23
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,333
that need to happen can
occur in the space.

24
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,208
And one of the beauties
of this space

25
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:55,000
is that it is
on its own venting system.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,291
And so, take for example
if, you know,

27
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,000
they needed
to burn something,

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,375
it wouldn't set off fire alarms
for the whole building.

29
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,999
And so, that's
a really important feature.

30
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,458
- Can you tell us
about your role

31
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,709
and how you support usage
of this space?

32
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,999
- Well, I'm the Tribal Liaison

33
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:13,750
and part of my role

34
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,583
is working on relationships
with Native Nations.

35
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,999
So, one of the requests
for this space

36
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,208
was minimal reflective surfaces.

37
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:29,041
And so, this furniture actually
is made without any metal.

38
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,000
It's all
from the wood.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,999
And the wood itself
I want to also highlight

40
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:33,917
is black ash

41
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:37,999
and it comes from
Menominee Tribal Enterprises.

42
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,583
And it's gorgeous,
as you can see.

43
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,417
And then, there are
12 chairs in here

44
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:46,999
to represent each of the Nations
here in Wisconsin.

45
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,166
- And from what I've learned,

46
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,417
there is intentionality
about the use of this space.

47
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,333
So, individuals reaching out
for more information

48
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,208
should be mindful
about that.

49
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,999
And there are possibly
limitations on who can access.

50
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:56,959
- Exactly.
- Awesome.

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,417
- Thank you so much
for your time today, Rachel.

52
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,083
- Well, thank you.
