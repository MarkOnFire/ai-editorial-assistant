to spark conversations
and engage residents.

8
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:30,458
This evening, we are joined
by Professor Sarah Anne Carter

9
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:34,999
to explore the importance
of preserving material culture

10
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:40,000
for both our community
and our collective experience.

<i>An Emotional History
of the American Museum.</i>

27
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:49,041
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Carter today.

28
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,125
[all applauding]

29
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,792
Thank you.

30
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:58,041
- So thank you so much, Tamara,
for that lovely introduction.

31
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,250
And thank you all so much
for inviting me here today

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,250
to deliver a Badger Talk.

33
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,792
It's really quite meaningful
for me to be here in Sheboygan

34
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,208
because the last time
I was here at this museum

35
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,999
almost a decade ago,
I had the great pleasure

36
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,125
of seeing this object
that has stuck with me now

37
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,333
for almost 10 years.

38
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,083
And I actually get
to talk about that today.

39
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,417
I got to do some research on it,

40
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,999
and so you will know that object
when you see it

41
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:24,999
in a little while.

42
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:25,959
It's been really fun this week

43
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,667
getting to know that thing
a little better.

44
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,166
It's wonderful
to be with all of you.

45
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,125
So as we begin, I wanna
acknowledge the place

46
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:38,417
where I'm really privileged
to work, which is Madison,

47
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,999
or Teejop, as it is also called.

48
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,999
And I wanna just take a moment
to share with you

49
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:47,500
UW's commitment
to understanding basically

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,667
how the colonization that
we all still live with today

51
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:55,792
informs our shared future of
collaboration and innovation.

52
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,542
And this is a plaque
that's on Bascom Hill.

53
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,291
And it's really important
to think about

54
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,291
how this history of colonization
that we live with

55
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,291
informs this shared future

56
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:10,166
of our collaboration innovation
with the Ho-Chunk Nation.

57
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,917
And today, UW-Madison respects
the inherent sovereignty

58
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:14,750
of the Ho-Chunk Nation,

59
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,375
along with the 11 other
First Nations of Wisconsin.

60
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,291
And in particular today,
standing here in Sheboygan,

61
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,750
that means acknowledging
the Ho-Chunk, the Potawatomi,

62
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,458
the Menominee, the Oneida,
and the Ojibwe people

63
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,583
along the southwest shores
of here at Lake Michigan.

64
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,125
So my talk today is part
of a very special

65
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,625
Preservation Month series here

66
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,417
at the Sheboygan
Historical Society.

67
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,250
Your wonderful curator,
Tamara Lange,

68
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,542
will be talking next week
about how you physically care

69
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,041
for collections here, okay,

70
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,000
how you physically do that work
both here and at home.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,999
And today, I have the job
of talking about

72
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,166
how we intellectually care
for objects, okay?

73
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,959
I have the job
for talking about the stories

74
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,083
that we care for when
we care for collections.

75
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,375
And this is a topic that's
really been at the heart

76
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,375
of my career for the past
two decades as a curator

77
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,208
and now as a professor
and center director at Madison.

78
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,250
So in my talk today, I'm
arguing that the intellectual

79
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,999
and cultural care of objects,
in effect,

80
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:21,542
carrying the stories embedded
in things through time,

81
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,542
allows objects
to help us connect past,

82
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,999
present, and future.

83
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,792
And it's a vital part
of collections care work.

84
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,417
And this is work that
we can all be part of, okay?

85
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:36,999
We can all do our part
to support these stories

86
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:37,959
in our communities.

87
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,999
By caring for objects,
museums care for stories.

88
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:44,041
And I believe really firmly
that by caring for stories,

89
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,417
we care for people
in our communities, okay?

90
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:49,709
And so caring for objects
and caring for people

91
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,041
are actually connected.

92
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,999
And I truly think of material
things, like the treasures

93
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:57,999
in this collection, I think
of them as time travelers

94
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,417
creating an opportunity
for a rooted,

95
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:03,999
community-based connection
across time.

96
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,417
And I really wanna thank Tamara

97
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,542
for very generously helping me
access and research

98
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:12,250
three fascinating objects
from your collection

99
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,750
that will be woven
into my presentation today.

100
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,083
So as I said, I come to you

101
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,208
from the University
of Wisconsin-Madison,

102
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,625
and from the Center for Design
and Material Culture.

103
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,999
I'm a professor in the School
of Human Ecology there.

104
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,999
And I run the CDMC.

105
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,166
The CDMC, Center for Design
and Material Culture,

106
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,208
is a place that really strives
to be a hub

107
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,250
for material culture
and design, both on campus,

108
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,250
nationally, and also
internationally.

109
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,999
So we really root our work
in the study of material things

110
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,834
and in the design and creation
of meaningful objects,

111
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:51,125
connecting people and things
in lots of different ways.

112
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,375
Our center is also home

113
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,917
to the Helen Louise Allen
Textile Collection,

114
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:58,500
which is an absolutely
amazing textile collection

115
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,417
of more than 13,000 objects.

116
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:05,041
And this collection has been
around and been part of UW

117
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,333
for more than 50 years.

118
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,667
And we just recently did a full
inventory of the collection.

119
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,291
And when you look at these
pictures, don't worry,

120
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:15,667
it does not look like the image
closest to me anymore.

121
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,000
This was from decades ago, but
keep images like that in mind

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,291
when you get into the kinds
of collection care work

123
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,959
I know Tamara is gonna be
teaching you about, right?

124
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,083
What does it mean
to truly care for objects

125
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,500
and to have objects in the
kinds of storage context

126
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,291
that can really help us
keep them for the future?

127
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,250
Now, in the CDMC,
we engage in a whole range

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,834
of research projects
related to material culture,

129
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,999
textiles, and design.

130
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,750
We have a lot of different kinds
of student opportunities

131
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,083
around these various topics.

132
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,999
And we actually invite in more
than 50 classes every year

133
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,583
into the center to do this work,

134
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:55,291
from maybe expected classes
like my design history classes

135
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,500
to maybe unexpected places.

136
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,750
For example, every year, we
have a financial coaching class

137
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,999
that comes in to work
with our collection,

138
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,208
because investigating an object
can help you understand

139
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,875
what people value, right?

140
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,999
A central skill
for a financial coach, right?

141
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:13,667
So we love to think of creative
ways to use our collection

142
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,917
and connect across campus.

143
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:20,000
We also have two galleries
and a really active slate

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,250
of hands-on experiences,
lots of making opportunities,

145
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,333
lectures, and programs.

146
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,208
And we think a lot about how
we care for our collection

147
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,875
from the kinds of best practices
we need to use,

148
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,875
whether that's using
acid-free paper

149
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,625
or conducting a
regular inventory,

150
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,125
or thinking about how
we maintain our database,

151
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,542
to really creating
meaningful opportunities

152
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,999
for our undergraduate
and graduate students

153
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:46,709
who work with us in the center.

154
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,625
And opportunities
for curricular engagement

155
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,999
around topics like avoiding
cultural appropriation,

156
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,333
for example, helping our
students really think about

157
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,834
what are the museum questions
they need to be prepared

158
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,999
to ask and answer today
and in the future, right?

159
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,250
That's really central
to the work we do.

160
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,999
And this is work that's
really vital for the future

161
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,999
of places like the
Sheboygan County Museum as well.

162
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,999
So we are gonna be rooting
our discussion today

163
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,208
in the early history
of museums to help us

164
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,792
really think through some
strategies for understanding

165
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:20,375
how we can fruitfully approach
objects in museum collections

166
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,000
in order to understand
how the kinds of treasures

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
that we're gonna be
talking about today

168
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,208
from this collection,
treasures like this awesome,

169
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:36,041
and when I say awesome,
I mean huge seed wreath

170
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,417
that you see here in this image.

171
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,083
Treasures like the detail
I'm sharing with you

172
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,417
of this really wonderful,
charming,

173
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:48,458
incredibly important signature
quilt from the 1940s,

174
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,917
and this hunk of wood
at the bottom of this slide,

175
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:54,250
which I'll talk more about
in a little while.

176
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,208
We will think about
these treasures,

177
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,999
and we'll think together about
how the histories of museums,

178
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,583
as well as methods
from material culture

179
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,999
can help us understand
and make sense of these objects,

180
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,166
can help us connect
these objects to stories

181
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,625
in meaningful ways.

182
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,250
So to begin.

183
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:21,125
To begin, I like to go way back,
way back to 1655,

184
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,667
back to one of my
favorite images of a museum.

185
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,999
This is Ole Worm's
Museum Wormianum

186
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,959
in Leiden from 1655.

187
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,667
And Ole Worm was a professor,
probably nothing like me,

188
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,999
but also a professor.

189
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,083
And he had this museum,
this collection,

190
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,208
and this is the image that he
published in this collection,

191
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,750
in his catalog
of this collection that,

192
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,417
as the frontis to the book.

193
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:54,583
And basically he named
this book<i>Worm's Museum.</i>

194
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,999
It's translated from the Latin,
or<i>A History of Rare Things.</i>

195
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,625
He divided the collection,
represented here in this image,

196
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,583
into the original
kind of Aristotelian category.

197
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:10,999
So we have animals,
vegetables, minerals, right?

198
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,875
Then he added a fourth category,

199
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,041
the fourth category
of artificialia,

200
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,667
so things made by man.

201
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,834
So in this book, he's dividing
all of the different things

202
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:22,834
that you see here
into these categories,

203
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,458
trying to make sense
of the world, okay?

204
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,959
And my students actually
had the privilege

205
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,000
of studying a copy of this book

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,709
in special collections
at Madison.

207
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,834
We have amazing books like this

208
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,917
that we're actually
able to go and study.

209
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:39,542
So we spent some time
with this 1655 book

210
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,999
earlier this semester.

211
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,667
And when we look closely
at this image together,

212
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,750
we can see all sorts
of interesting things.

213
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,125
If you look really closely,
you can make out the words

214
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,959
on some of the boxes
in the back.

215
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,417
And my Latin is a little rusty.

216
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,291
Maybe yours is a little better,
I don't know.

217
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,999
But if we translate some
of the words on those boxes,

218
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:03,959
we see things like boxes
of animal parts,

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,542
boxes of shells,
boxes of stones,

220
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,166
boxes of soils, all
different kinds of materials

221
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,166
that might fit into this

222
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,208
animal-vegetable-mineral
category.

223
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,417
We see all kinds of things.

224
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,625
There's a canoe on the ceiling,
there are tortoise shells.

225
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,166
There is an array
of probably weapons

226
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,083
or spears on the back wall.

227
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:29,417
There's this funny little figure
at the very back of the room.

228
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,166
It's an automaton,

229
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,417
so a clockwork figure
that could move.

230
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,417
These are pretty wondrous,
interesting things

231
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:40,291
all brought together
in this collection.

232
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,959
The collection further
can come to life for us.

233
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,999
And we look at this
really wonderful work

234
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,875
by contemporary artist
Rosamond Purcell,

235
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:55,125
who actually recreated
Ole Worm's museum in 2005.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,583
Now, I love this installation.

237
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,000
I think this is just an
incredibly powerful way

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,875
to think about that image
that I just shared with you,

239
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,250
and helps us think about
how varied and really bold

240
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,709
his attempt
to order the world was.

241
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,041
Now, I want you
to look at this image,

242
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,792
and I want you
to think to yourself,

243
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:22,959
"How do you go about doing that,
creating an image like this?

244
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,999
How do you go about creating
an installation like this?"

245
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,250
Think about the things
that are in there.

246
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,417
There's a polar bear,
there's an automaton.

247
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,834
There are all kinds of weapons
hung on the wall.

248
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:39,542
There are those boxes of animal
parts and shells and rocks.

249
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,208
But just sort of imagine

250
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,999
that you are going to create
something like this.

251
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,458
Think of all the
different people

252
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,999
you would need to talk to
to do this.

253
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,792
Think of all the
different collections

254
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,834
you would need to connect with,

255
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,583
because these kinds of objects
are not housed

256
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,542
in the same museum today.

257
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,625
They're not housed in the
same cabinet as they were

258
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,999
in Ole Worm's time, right?

259
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,999
Because they've been divided up

260
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,291
into all of these
different sorts of museums.

261
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,500
Museums for shells,
museums for taxidermy,

262
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,999
museums for cultural objects

263
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:18,999
like the canoe hanging
from the ceiling, okay?

264
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,999
And so we can look at this
and we can understand

265
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:28,333
what it might feel like to bring
an image like this to life.

266
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,208
But we can also look at this
and think about the logistics,

267
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,750
the complexity,
kind of the museum culture

268
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,959
that this might
make visible for us.

269
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,999
And just think how many people
and how many layers

270
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,000
would you have to go to
to create something like this?

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,999
Rosamond Purcell's
installation reminds us

272
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,999
that the world
of Ole Worm's museum

273
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,542
has changed a lot
over the years,

274
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,667
but it still creates
this sense of wonder

275
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,458
when you look at it.

276
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,999
It is still a space that
helps us think about wonder,

277
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,417
possibility, and connection.

278
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,625
Now, I want you to think about
all those different people

279
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,625
you'd have to connect with
as we move forward in our talk.

280
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,375
Now, you've likely
experienced your own version

281
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,041
of a cabinet like this

282
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,208
if you love museums and ever
make it down to Milwaukee.

283
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,667
Has anyone visited the
Milwaukee Public Museum

284
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,583
and made it
to<i>A Sense of Wonder?</i>

285
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,166
Okay, I'm seeing some nods,
I'm seeing some hands.

286
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:22,999
That's great.

287
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:26,500
Fantastic installation
at the Milwaukee Public Museum.

288
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,417
So they have their own version
of a cabinet, okay?

289
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,333
And this installation,
this<i>Sense of Wonder,</i>

290
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,166
really leans into that history
that I was just sharing

291
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,625
with you a little bit about.

292
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,999
Creates a feeling of awe,
a feeling of wonder

293
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,542
at just the assembled group
of things

294
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,792
that's kind of supposed
to wash over you, okay?

295
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,959
And it's supposed to have
a real impact on you.

296
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,999
This is something
that would be called,

297
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,417
like, a cabinet of wonder,
a Wunderkammern, right?

298
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,750
A place that you would open up

299
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,291
and be able
to narrate the world.

300
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,417
And while we focus on
the wonder feelings

301
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,125
in a place like this,
more than anything,

302
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,625
it is an intellectual attempt
to order nature,

303
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,291
to make sense of things, right?

304
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,291
Wonder is one result of that,

305
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:14,999
but it's an attempt to try
to find order in the world.

306
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,166
And so when we think about
sort of the history of museums,

307
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,625
we think of a history
that comes from a place

308
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,875
of sorting and categorizing.

309
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,083
We think of a history that
brings things together

310
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,709
and tries to make sense,
not just of wonder, right,

311
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,500
but of the world.

312
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,625
And this is really important
to the new book

313
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,083
that I'm working on that
Tamara mentioned briefly.

314
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,333
And in my new book
on museum feelings,

315
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,375
I'm thinking a lot
about this focus on wonder

316
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,250
versus a focus on understanding
and museums,

317
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,999
and thinking a lot
about this idea

318
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,750
that I'm kind of
calling wonder cover

319
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,834
in terms of what wonder
sometimes elides or hides

320
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,709
or prevents us from seeing
or understanding.

321
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,125
But that's a story
for another day.

322
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,959
But wonder's a very rich topic
for us to think about.

323
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,041
And wonder remains
really important

324
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,625
in the museum curator's toolkit.

325
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,333
And wonder,
sometimes it comes to the fore

326
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,041
in unexpected places,
in unexpected things.

327
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,875
It can come to the fore
in big things, like giant squids

328
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,875
and polar bears hanging
from the ceiling.

329
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,999
It can also come to the fore
sometimes in small places.

330
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,625
When I was the curator
and director of research

331
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,709
at the Chipstone Foundation,
I found this tiny little museum

332
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,250
in a box, and this is actually
a miniature cabinet,

333
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,917
it's not a full-size cabinet,

334
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:35,250
when I was visiting
the winter antique show

335
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,709
in New York that year.

336
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,834
And I immediately knew
I had to figure out

337
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,458
how to acquire this object
for Chipstone.

338
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:41,999
This is so cool.

339
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,999
It looks like this unassuming
little cabinet right now,

340
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,999
ha ha, but wait.

341
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,542
It tells a lot of stories.

342
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,959
When you open these little
drawers, what you find inside

343
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,999
are 37 little tubes,
almost like test tubes,

344
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:03,999
each of which has
a kind of relic object in it.

345
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,583
Each of these objects
has its own label,

346
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:11,917
and its own fairly dramatic
and interesting story

347
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,291
connected to it.

348
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,875
So in effect, what this is
is a museum in a box,

349
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,999
a tiny little museum that
you can carry with you

350
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,667
wherever you go.

351
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,709
These items are not sorted

352
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,999
into animal,
vegetable, and mineral.

353
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,959
And I can tell you, I've
spent hours with this object.

354
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,959
I have no idea how it's
supposed to be sorted,

355
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,999
apart from just
really cool things that can fit

356
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,208
inside of test tubes
in a small box, right?

357
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,834
There's no other organizing
principle that I can figure out,

358
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:41,750
but it is fascinating
and it is wondrous.

359
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,583
The things in this little box
open up windows onto the past,

360
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,834
connect us from tiny pieces
of history

361
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,208
to really big stories, okay?

362
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:57,959
These are four of my favorite
items from inside the box.

363
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:01,208
You can see we have
these tiny little items

364
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,125
inside these sealed test tubes.

365
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,417
And there's a note
in each of the tubes.

366
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:10,083
So allow me to read you
some of these.

367
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,166
"A piece of the wreck

368
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,333
"of Commodore Perry's
flagship<i>Lawrence,</i>

369
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,999
"which was exhibited
at the Centennial.

370
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:19,291
"From the colors worn
by Joe Goss in the ring

371
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,667
"at the Sullivan-Ryan fight.

372
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:25,250
"Peas served out to a prisoner
in Andersonville,

373
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,625
"who presented them
to H.W.H. at a soldier's fair.

374
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,291
And part of the battle flag
of the 55th Cavalry."

375
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,999
And this was a
Massachusetts regiment

376
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,375
of African-American soldiers.

377
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,208
Wow, okay.

378
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:46,417
Pretty fascinating group
of objects.

379
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:51,250
Tiny little things opening up
really big questions,

380
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,250
really big stories.

381
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,999
But part of what's
so interesting to me about it

382
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:59,333
is you need the story
with the thing, right?

383
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,999
You need that little piece,

384
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:04,458
but you also need the
carefully detailed label

385
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,750
that goes along with it.

386
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,458
The thing and the text
have to stay together,

387
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,000
because without these labels,
I mean, we end up

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,166
with a few peas
in a little glass jar.

389
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,125
Like, what's the story?

390
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,250
Like, we don't know
what's going on.

391
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,542
We need to keep that story
and that object together, right?

392
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,458
And when we think about
these 37 little vials

393
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,041
brought together
in this cabinet,

394
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:32,667
we can begin to recognize
that these peas, this feather,

395
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,709
these important pieces of cloth

396
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,999
come together to do
something important,

397
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:40,125
creating this little museum,
this little window

398
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,250
onto the world in this
late 19th century moment,

399
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,792
likely around the centennial
in 1876

400
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,792
when this was brought together.

401
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,999
It's another version
of Ole Worm's cabinet,

402
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,959
another way of thinking
about what does it mean

403
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,041
to create a collection.

404
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:02,917
And I immediately thought
about this little cabinet,

405
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,625
this little museum in a box,

406
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,875
when Tamara kindly shared
the first ledger book

407
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,458
of the Sheboygan
County Museum with me.

408
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,458
Initially, this museum, I mean,
started off as something

409
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,333
supported by the Daughters
of the American Revolution.

410
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,083
And so this is the original

411
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,083
Daughters of the American
Revolution object ledger.

412
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,500
And I'd like to invite us
to look closely together

413
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,625
at the objects that were
first acquired by this museum.

414
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,291
These objects are quite varied,

415
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,208
but each of them is closely
connected to a story.

416
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,999
And one of them is very similar
to our museum in a box.

417
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,083
The first object
on this ledger book

418
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,625
is a piece of wood from
historic battleship<i>Niagara</i>

419
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,208
of Commodore Perry's fleet,

420
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,999
which has lain for more
than a hundred years

421
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:55,625
at the bottom of Lake Erie,
given by Mrs. P.H. Peacock.

422
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,375
Now, from what I've been able
to learn in just a few days,

423
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,583
Mrs. Peacock's a completely
fascinating person.

424
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,333
But that's a story
probably for another day.

425
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,999
But if we continue down this
list, we have a powder can.

426
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:12,041
There is a copy of an important
newspaper article from 1803.

427
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:18,333
We continue on, we have another
newspaper article from 1865,

428
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,999
a important picture
from early Sheboygan history,

429
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:23,709
a railroad timetable, okay?

430
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:27,999
A real array of things,
a real array of things

431
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,792
that the founders of this museum
thought, "This is a story.

432
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,999
"This object is a touchstone
that can open up a world,

433
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,458
"that can open up a possibility.

434
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,500
"We need to save it,
we need to catalog it,

435
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,999
and we need to build and create
something around it," okay?

436
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,999
And so we can think about
that little museum in a box.

437
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,999
We can also think about this
much larger museum context

438
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:50,999
that we are part of here

439
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:54,750
when we think about
valuing these things.

440
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,792
This, we believe,
is that piece of wood

441
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,625
that started off this
whole collection.

442
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,999
And as you can see,
like those Andersonville peas

443
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,959
in that little test tube,
will be hard to know

444
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,792
without this context.

445
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:14,625
It would be hard to know
exactly what we're looking at.

446
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,834
Without it, it's a log.

447
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,625
It's a piece of wood.

448
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:21,875
And that story becomes
just as important

449
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,125
as the thing itself.

450
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,041
And it's a really
wonderful reminder

451
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,999
that there, people who
started this museum,

452
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:31,750
those early collections,
the knowledge and the stories

453
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,000
and the context that went along
with those things

454
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,792
were just as important
as the things themselves.

455
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:41,250
And whenever I start
thinking about a museum,

456
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,250
what becomes really important
to me is to really ask

457
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,709
and think about what
is the foundation

458
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,625
of this place
where I'm visiting?

459
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:53,041
What is it that makes this
museum the museum that it is?

460
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,250
Where did this
collection come from?

461
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,083
What are the categories?

462
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:02,458
What are the questions that
are driving this institution?

463
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:07,959
And these questions
of museums and categorization

464
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,291
are really quite important

465
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,834
and are really at the heart
of the history of museums.

466
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,917
And this has really been central
to the history

467
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,709
of my own research
for a long time

468
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,291
and central to my teaching.

469
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:23,125
And more than a decade ago,
these questions of museums

470
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,999
and categorization were
the foundation of a project

471
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,000
that I was privileged to work on

472
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,500
when I was at Harvard
called<i>Tangible Things.</i>

473
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,166
This project was something
that I worked on

474
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,375
along with Laurel Ulrich, Ivan
Gaskell, and Sarah Schechner,

475
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,750
three really wonderful scholars
and collaborators.

476
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,999
And what we did
was we investigated

477
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,250
how museums sort objects
into categories.

478
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,208
How do they do it?

479
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,875
What categories do museums pick?

480
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,999
And what does it mean to pick
one category over another?

481
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,250
What happens when you do that?

482
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,667
And these questions
about categorization

483
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,875
are a central part of a course
that I'm currently teaching

484
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,999
at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison.

485
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,792
It's a course called Histories
of Object-Based Learning,

486
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:09,000
in which we study how
and why materials are used

487
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,166
in different ways in different
academic contexts, right?

488
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,999
So the questions from this
project have really fed into

489
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:18,542
and shaped my current teaching
and research.

490
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,917
So going back
to<i>Tangible Things.</i>

491
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,999
NTangible Thingslooked to people
like George Brown Goode,

492
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:29,166
who was one of the leaders
of the Smithsonian Institution,

493
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:33,208
to think about how museums
sort things.

494
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,542
Goode created these six
different categories,

495
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,083
which he said, "All museums
are one of these things."

496
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,125
There's a museum of art,
there is a museum of history,

497
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,458
museum of anthropology,
natural history,

498
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,917
technology, commerce.

499
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,999
Museums are sorted into these
different categories.

500
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,999
And what thinking about Goode's
categorization makes so apparent

501
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:55,875
is that the type of museum
something is

502
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,250
really shapes the
kinds of questions

503
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,999
we ask about the objects
in that museum, right?

504
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,500
We're gonna ask
different objects

505
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,999
different kinds of questions,
depending on where they sit.

506
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,959
And one of the challenges
with a material thing

507
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,917
versus something
like a digital file

508
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,417
is it has to sit in one place.

509
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,333
It has to be in a museum, right?

510
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,667
It can't live in lots of places.

511
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,792
It is a thing
in the world, right?

512
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,875
And so, depending
on where you put it,

513
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,792
depending on the category
that it is part of

514
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,999
will determine the questions
that we can ask.

515
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,583
And so just playing
with this idea opened up

516
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,999
some really cool possibilities
for engaging with

517
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,291
and thinking about objects.

518
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,166
And I'm just gonna share
a couple of those today.

519
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,375
One of my favorite objects
from this project

520
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:42,208
is this board game, "Blondie
Goes to Leisureland."

521
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,667
Some of you may be
familiar with Blondie

522
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,291
from your cartoon-reading days,

523
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,208
which perhaps,
perhaps they're today.

524
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,834
Perhaps you're all still
reading Blondie cartoons.

525
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,375
I hope you are.

526
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,999
But it's this really
fascinating object

527
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:58,333
because we could look at it
and be delighted by the graphics

528
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:02,333
and by its connection
to<i>Blondie and Dagwood</i>

529
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,999
and these cartoon characters.

530
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:09,834
But we're also playing a game,
just thinking about childhood.

531
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,000
But then we can look at it
and think to ourselves,

532
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,417
"Huh, how does Blondie
get to Leisureland?"

533
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:18,583
Well, she gets to Leisureland
through,

534
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:22,709
surprise, surprise,
rural electrification.

535
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,500
That's how Blondie's
gonna get to Leisureland.

536
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,291
And so it looks like this
delightful, fun game.

537
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,041
But Blondie has
to play this game.

538
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,792
And as she does,
goes through each step,

539
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,208
she gets to acquire
a whole range of appliances.

540
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,959
They're gonna make her life
easier.

541
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,709
And if any of you know Blondie,

542
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,083
you know she gets
into a lot of trouble.

543
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,583
And new appliances could be
a good thing or a bad thing,

544
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:49,291
depending on the day probably,
with her track record.

545
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:53,542
But rural electrification
is a key part of this, right?

546
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:57,875
So there's a history
of technology strand here, okay?

547
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,750
There is an
aesthetic story here.

548
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,875
We're looking at this
really quite gorgeous,

549
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,333
late 1930s, early 1940s,
almost, like, poster

550
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,291
that you could frame, right?

551
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,750
From an aesthetic perspective
with the colors and the shapes.

552
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:17,999
We could also think about gender
roles and women's history,

553
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,917
and think about, huh,
why is everything

554
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,792
Blondie's responsibility
in this context, right?

555
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:24,834
And thinking about histories
of women's work, right?

556
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,999
So depending on where
you put this object,

557
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,999
it could go in lots
of different directions, right?

558
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,917
Which makes it
pretty fascinating.

559
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,291
But if it just sat
on one of those shelves,

560
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:38,875
sort of in George Brown Goode's
imaginary museums, right,

561
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,333
it limits what it can do.

562
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,917
Another object that we
thought about in this project

563
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:48,709
that opens up those kinds of
doors is this beetle necklace

564
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,500
or bracelet, which I think
is just gorgeous.

565
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
So this is something,
it's probably from either India

566
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,625
or Myanmar, we're not sure.

567
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,999
And it's in the collection
of the Peabody Museum

568
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,333
of Archaeology and Ethnology.

569
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:03,875
But it's a bracelet.

570
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,458
It's a piece of jewelry, right?

571
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,333
It's also five insects.

572
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:12,000
It also has a really
fascinating aesthetic.

573
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,291
It's something beautiful.

574
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,917
Is it a work of,
could it be a work of art?

575
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:17,750
You know, is it
a work of history?

576
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,667
Is it a work of culture?

577
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,500
Natural history,
are we looking at insects

578
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,333
that we could connect

579
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:26,500
to a natural history collection,
right?

580
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
What is it?

581
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,917
It's a category crosser.

582
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,417
And in crossing
those categories,

583
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,583
I think that's where we
kind of feel that sense of like,

584
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:37,375
"Huh," you know,
wondering, pondering,

585
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,583
thinking about the connections
that an object like this

586
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,999
could help us make, okay?

587
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:46,875
And so this way
of thinking about things

588
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,999
opens up these possibilities
for us.

589
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,250
Now, there's an object
in this collection

590
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,083
that is also very much
a category crosser.

591
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:05,250
And I think it is an
absolutely wonderful thing.

592
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,500
And this object, maybe some
of you know what it is.

593
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,750
But look closely.

594
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,709
And as you look closely,
you might begin to see

595
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:20,709
some of the tiny
little pieces that form

596
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:23,250
this lovely floral wreath.

597
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:28,250
It's made out of seeds,
and it is huge.

598
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,834
This was the object that I saw
here almost 10 years ago,

599
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,667
that when I had the chance
to talk to Tamara,

600
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:39,999
I said, "I think I remember
this giant seed wreath.

601
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:41,999
"That's yours, right?

602
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:42,750
You have it?"

603
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,500
And she's like,
"Oh, yeah, it's ours."

604
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,999
And it was wonderful to learn
a little bit more about it.

605
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:53,625
But looking at this object,
is it a work of history?

606
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,999
Is it a work of art?

607
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,291
Natural history,
economic botany?

608
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,250
What is it?

609
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,834
What is this thing, okay?

610
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,291
And frankly, the path
that we choose to go down

611
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:08,083
as we explore it,
that path is gonna determine

612
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,959
how we shape its story.

613
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:10,999
It's gonna determine the story

614
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:13,083
we decide to tell
about it, okay?

615
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,792
And part of what
is so interesting

616
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:16,999
is the museum wasn't quite sure

617
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:20,083
what to do with this object
initially either.

618
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,417
So here it is on display,

619
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,500
kind of hidden
in the background there

620
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,250
behind this group of mannequins.

621
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,999
It's there in the corner
on the wall.

622
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:34,750
It's probably upside-down
at this point, right?

623
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,041
You know...

624
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,999
Okay, so they still weren't
quite sure what to do

625
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:42,999
with this object, but it's
been on view for a long time.

626
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:48,999
And so in 1968, the museum
decided to try to figure out,

627
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,458
"Well, what's going on here?"

628
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:55,041
I mean, how do you lose the
records for a giant object?

629
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,999
And of course, we know
things are complicated

630
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,750
and we have objects like this
that have this

631
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,999
sort of complexity in our
collection as well, right?

632
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,625
So I say that from a place
of empathy, right?

633
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,375
It's complicated.

634
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,500
You know, and the museum moved
and changed hands.

635
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,625
All of these things
happened over the course

636
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:10,999
of the early 20th century.

637
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:14,999
You know, the 20-plus years
in between it being acquired

638
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,417
and this article being written.

639
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,417
But it was found,
they put it on view,

640
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:19,999
and wanted to figure it out.

641
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,583
And so here it is
in<i>The Sheboygan Press,</i>

642
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,999
"Maker, donor unknown," right?

643
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,041
So not anonymous.

644
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,917
'Cause we know someone
intentionally made this.

645
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,999
Someone intentionally gave it.

646
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,917
And by saying that,
they're acknowledging

647
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,625
that, "We wanna find out
who that is.

648
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,999
We wanna find out who that is."

649
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,999
So we don't know that yet.

650
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,667
We will know that soon.

651
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,750
But at the time,
what did they know?

652
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,999
Well, they could look closely
at the materials

653
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:53,250
of this object: acorns,
popcorns, pecans,

654
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,999
sunflowers, walnuts,
rice, tapioca,

655
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:00,417
sago, peach stones, cherry pits,
on and on, right?

656
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,250
There's a lot of amazing stuff
in this object.

657
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,583
We know the context;
it had to have been collected

658
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:09,542
before 1953 'cause then
it was in the collection.

659
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,250
We know the size.

660
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,999
So I said, "This thing
is massive, right?"

661
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,999
The wreath
is four by three feet,

662
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,667
the frame is six by five feet.

663
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,125
It weighs 60 to 65 pounds,
right?

664
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,417
It's just, like,
bigger than a small child.

665
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,333
Like, it's a big object, okay?

666
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:29,333
And we know the quality
of this object, right?

667
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,999
The person who created it
was meticulous.

668
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,542
It was well-planned.

669
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:35,750
It took years to make.

670
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,875
A great deal of care went into
the creation of this thing.

671
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:42,375
So these are things we do know,

672
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,999
even if the donor and maker
are still unknown.

673
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:52,458
So what if we think of it
as a natural history specimen?

674
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,417
That could work, right?

675
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,999
We could think about the seeds.

676
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,333
We could think about all
of the different objects,

677
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:03,250
little tiny seeds that go into
make this gorgeous wreath.

678
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,208
And the people here at the
museum who were caring for it

679
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,999
and wondering about it
and trying to figure it out

680
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,999
listed out, you know,
they looked carefully,

681
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,750
found all of these little seeds
as part of it, right,

682
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,375
as part of their care
for this object.

683
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,999
And so we think about it, could
it be a collection of seeds?

684
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,999
Could scientists
study this object

685
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,999
and understand something
about seeds trapped in time

686
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,208
from the 1890s?

687
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,999
Could we learn something
from this about seeds

688
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:35,208
before crops might be
genetically modified?

689
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,625
Could we learn something
about this,

690
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,208
about foodways
in the late 19th century?

691
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,834
What are people eating here
in Sheboygan

692
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:44,041
at this moment, right?

693
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:47,041
We could learn something
about agricultural history

694
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:47,999
from this object, right?

695
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,375
We could take it
in all of those directions.

696
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:55,375
You know, we could put it
in a long line of works

697
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,999
that could lead to something
like the seed art

698
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:02,208
that we see at a place
like the Minnesota State Fair.

699
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,500
And my husband,
who's from Wisconsin,

700
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,750
originally told me to apologize
for having anything

701
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,291
about Minnesota in my
presentation, so, sorry.

702
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,999
But I thought
it was a cool image.

703
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,625
You know, it's part
of this long history

704
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,792
from, you know,
19th century seed art

705
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,999
all the way,
19th century seed wreaths

706
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:20,625
to 21st century seed art.

707
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,333
We could put it
in that sort of trajectory.

708
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,999
We could think about it
in the context

709
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:27,542
of the National
Agricultural Library.

710
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:31,041
Would they like to know what
seeds are there available to us

711
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,667
to think about
in the 1890s, right?

712
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:35,917
We could think about
all those things

713
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,999
just from the economic botany,
natural history

714
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:42,083
kind of seed perspective
of this object.

715
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,999
But of course,
when you're looking at it,

716
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,166
and it's gorgeous,
we have to ask questions

717
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,333
about aesthetics, right?

718
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,375
We have to ask questions
about what it looks like.

719
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,999
And these are some hair wreaths.

720
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,959
This is one hair wreath,
the two details

721
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,999
from the Helen Louise Allen
Textile Collection

722
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:00,999
that is part of my
research center.

723
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:04,500
You know, and there are a lot
of formal similarities

724
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,125
that we could draw.

725
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,750
We're looking at two
different kinds of objects,

726
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,792
one made of hair,
one made of seeds,

727
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,500
emulating a floral wreath.

728
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
What can you do
with these different kinds

729
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,041
of natural materials?

730
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,999
And from an
aesthetic perspective,

731
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,542
there are a lot of similarities.

732
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:22,000
I mean, this hair wreath
does not weigh 65 pounds,

733
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,667
because that is a scary concept

734
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,999
as a person responsible
for a collection.

735
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:26,999
It's much smaller.

736
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,834
But aesthetically,
there's similarities.

737
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,917
Even closer similarities
to an object like this one,

738
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,166
also from the collection.

739
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,458
So we can see maybe
some of the inspiration.

740
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,458
Thankfully, the niece
of the woman who created it

741
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:43,999
managed to solve the mystery
of this object,

742
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:47,417
which I just think
is the coolest thing.

743
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:50,333
So she was able
to connect with the museum,

744
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,333
and we learn from this
newspaper clipping

745
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:56,125
that Miss Gottschalk had
recalled admiring the wreath

746
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,917
as a child, and said
her aunt made it

747
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,583
to occupy her leisure time.

748
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,125
So how wonderful.

749
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,750
And as we learn more
about this story,

750
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,375
it seems like
she actually passed away

751
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,999
shortly after she shared
this information.

752
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,959
So it was one of those, like,
just-in-time connections, right?

753
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:15,125
To be able to share this story
with the museum.

754
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,750
And so that brings us
to this context now

755
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,792
of history and memory, right?

756
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:22,542
So we've thought about this
as a work of natural history,

757
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,125
botany, economic botany,
all those connections.

758
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,166
We've thought about aesthetics,

759
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,875
but now we can think
about history and memory

760
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,667
in relation to this object.

761
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:35,208
And here is a longer,
really quite wonderful

762
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,750
little narrative
from the object file.

763
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,999
So Miss Gottschalk in 1968,
she was 70 years old,

764
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,542
used to admire the wreath
as a child,

765
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,917
having her aunt
identify all the seeds,

766
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,667
nuts, et cetera, in the wreath.

767
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,125
But always admonished
not to touch it.

768
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,583
The wreaths made by Mrs. Dreier
in her early marriage,

769
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:54,875
probably in 1890.

770
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,999
She did it for recreation,

771
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,709
as some women would knit
or crochet.

772
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,291
It was always displayed
in the Dreier home on an easel,

773
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,000
and weighs about 65 pounds.

774
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,750
So reading this closely,
this jumped out at me.

775
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,875
This is something
she was doing for recreation,

776
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,458
a kind of fancy work, right?

777
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,999
Like knitting
or like crochet, okay,

778
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:17,333
so we understand this
is her creative work.

779
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,250
But I also loved this,

780
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,458
having her aunt identify
all the seeds and nuts.

781
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,583
So that brings us right back
to this botany context.

782
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,125
That brings us right back
to a natural history story.

783
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,999
Yes, it's beautiful,
but what are all the pieces?

784
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:35,999
What are the natural history
botany stories here

785
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:38,834
that she was inviting
her niece into?

786
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:39,999
And of course, do not touch it

787
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,917
because if you could
imagine a small child

788
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:45,458
near a 65-pound wreath
on an easel,

789
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,999
it's slightly terrifying, right?

790
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,999
It just seems, like,
quite dangerous.

791
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,125
So she didn't touch it,
but she was learning

792
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,875
all of the pieces, okay?

793
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:56,999
And because her niece
made that connection,

794
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:58,166
we know who the maker is.

795
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,625
And because we know that,
we can learn a little bit more

796
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:04,375
about her and go back
to her obituary

797
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,999
when she passed in 1942.

798
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,583
So Mrs. Mary Dreier
was "well-known

799
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,625
"for her beautiful handwork
on church altars

800
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,291
"and on priest vestments.

801
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,417
"She was most interested
in her garden

802
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:20,583
and was active as a mission
worker in the Holy Name Church."

803
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,875
And so looking for images of,
say,

804
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,625
Holy Name Church
from this period,

805
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,041
you can kind of see
the sense of scale

806
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,999
that maybe she was thinking
about in her giant wreath.

807
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:31,041
Perhaps there might be some
aesthetic connections,

808
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,999
perhaps future research
could see

809
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,999
do any of those
vestments survive?

810
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,999
Are there any connections
that could be made

811
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:38,250
to her other work?

812
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,333
Really exciting.

813
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,792
But what really got me
was this line.

814
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,291
"She was most interested
in her garden."

815
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:48,875
And so we're right back
to that natural history story.

816
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:52,834
But in this case, she's making
flowers, yes, from seeds,

817
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:53,999
but from seeds put together.

818
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,417
She's growing flowers
that can still last

819
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,542
to this day, right?

820
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:02,999
So imagining this woman
from the 1890s

821
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:07,542
to the early 1940s,
gardening in a way

822
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:10,250
that will last for decades,
right?

823
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,999
It's pretty beautiful
and it reminds us

824
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:17,875
that these categories
keep crossing, keep moving.

825
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,917
As we think about the
kinds of categories

826
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,999
that something like the
seed wreath fits into,

827
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,999
we really quickly are
thinking about art and design,

828
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:26,834
history, anthropology,
natural history,

829
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:30,875
technology, commerce, and even
something a little more,

830
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:34,458
that emotional connection
of understanding.

831
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,333
You know, she loved
her garden the most,

832
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,500
and here is a garden
that will last,

833
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,959
that we can still enjoy
from seeds

834
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:46,500
that she created and put
together, but didn't plant.

835
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,667
So we can also get to some
really poetic places

836
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,291
when we allow these
categories to cross

837
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,999
and to think about how
these questions

838
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,834
can talk to each other
in meaningful ways.

839
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,792
And thinking about it
in this way makes this object

840
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,625
just even more meaningful
for me.

841
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:07,083
I think it's just such
a fantastic thing.

842
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,917
Now, thinking through categories
like these

843
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:14,375
can help us get to the stories
we wanna tell,

844
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,999
and that's part of how
we care for objects.

845
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,625
But so can asking different
kinds of questions, right?

846
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,750
And there are various lines of
material cultural questioning

847
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,999
that can help us get
to new stories about objects.

848
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:29,208
I wanna very briefly share
some of those questions

849
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:32,458
that we thought through in the
<i>Questioning Things</i>exhibit,

850
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,458
which was a project we did
at the CDMC

851
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,500
a couple of years ago.

852
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,875
And for this project, what I did
was I invited my colleagues

853
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,375
and alumns of our
Material Culture program

854
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:45,999
to share questions
about the objects on view,

855
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:49,500
acknowledging that
if I were to do it all myself,

856
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,125
I only have one perspective.

857
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,458
One of the strengths
of material culture scholarship

858
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:56,999
is that you can bring things
from multiple perspectives,

859
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,458
multiple voices.

860
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,792
It is naturally collaborative.

861
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,875
And when you have
multiple perspectives,

862
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,667
the work becomes much stronger.

863
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,999
We often think of collaboration
maybe in the sciences,

864
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,750
but collaboration in the
humanities also invites

865
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,041
much stronger and more exciting
and more rigorous work.

866
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,999
And so inviting my colleagues
to do this allowed us

867
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,417
to put together an exhibition
that was beautiful,

868
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:22,999
but also an exhibition that
was really question-driven.

869
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:25,500
And so to do this,
we actually created a handbook

870
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,375
for<i>Questioning Things
</i> that is free and accessible

871
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,999
on our website that
you can download

872
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,834
and see, like, what
those questions are.

873
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,291
What kinds of questions
might you bring to an object?

874
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:38,959
How might you begin to approach
a material thing?

875
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,959
So some of the things
that we thought about

876
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,166
are things like this phonograph
shown here.

877
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:49,834
And we asked a history of
science professor and a curator,

878
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,208
actually two curators, a couple,

879
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,000
like, "How do you think
about this thing?"

880
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,542
And together,
we started thinking about

881
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:57,999
how do objects' meaning
change over time,

882
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,917
or are there hidden themes
in this object?

883
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,417
Like what questions
might we begin to bring out

884
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:06,250
as we examine this
early 20th century phonograph,

885
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,625
an incredibly cool object
that was actually sent

886
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,959
by Thomas Edison to Madison

887
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,999
for use in the
physics department.

888
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:14,917
Fascinating provenance.

889
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:15,709
You could stop there,

890
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:17,999
or you could keep asking
more questions,

891
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:21,999
which they invited participants
to do.

892
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,875
Or in a totally different
category of questions,

893
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,417
we could think about
how do artists see things,

894
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,667
how do makers see things?

895
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:33,375
Inviting our visitors
to sketch what they see,

896
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,875
to pick a detail,
to look closely,

897
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,250
to draw it,
to think about close looking

898
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,417
as a line of questioning.

899
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,166
And I couldn't resist
putting this image in

900
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:47,667
because it shows more
of our 19th century wreaths,

901
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,999
as well as two wreaths
that are in the framed pieces

902
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,041
made by contemporary artist
Martha Glowacki.

903
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:55,999
So reminding us that
contemporary artists

904
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:58,250
are also part of this
conversation, right,

905
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,999
and can be in really
wonderful ways

906
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:03,375
with our historical collections.

907
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:07,999
We can also think about
how maybe inviting students

908
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,583
into this work can help us
do interesting things.

909
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,999
In this case,
we left one drawer empty,

910
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,709
and my colleague,
Professor Marina Moskowitz,

911
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:18,333
had her students basically
curate mini exhibits

912
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,999
throughout the semester
in conversation

913
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,458
with the larger project.

914
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,041
Or, of course, thinking
about exhibitions and works

915
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,917
on view through your body,
right?

916
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,999
Actually trying things out,
touching things,

917
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:31,458
engaging physically with things.

918
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:34,583
That's a whole 'nother line
of questioning.

919
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,792
So the idea here is that these
different lines of questions,

920
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,625
these different ways
of engaging with things

921
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:43,875
are designed to really get
your creative juices flowing

922
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:44,999
as a researcher, right?

923
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,959
Because research
should be creative.

924
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,458
Making connections
and engaging with objects

925
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,583
should be something
that allows you

926
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,458
to creatively connect things

927
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:56,999
and to think about how we might
tell meaningful stories

928
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:59,333
with the things
that we care about.

929
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:03,500
And I really think that
this kind of approach

930
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,417
invites an attentiveness
to material things

931
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:09,709
that I see as really closely
related to care, right?

932
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:12,417
When you're attentive to things,
when you're asking questions,

933
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,999
you're also caring
for those things.

934
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:16,959
And that ethics of care,
I think, is part of what we do

935
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:19,999
as museum professionals when
we think about our collections

936
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:24,041
and the communities
we are privileged to serve.

937
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,083
And this item
in your collection,

938
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:32,291
which is also here in the room
with us, what a treasure.

939
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:35,667
It invites this kind
of attentive care.

940
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:39,041
I think it really invites
this kind of care.

941
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:43,291
This object,
"The Kraft Cheese House 'Gang'"

942
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:47,625
signature quilt
from 1942 to 1999.

943
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:52,041
1942/1999, which I will explain
in a little bit.

944
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:55,417
So here's what we know
about the woman

945
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:58,000
initially responsible
for this object.

946
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,500
Here she is, Julie Powell,
nee Skrube,

947
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,875
in her Kraft Cheese uniform
in 1942.

948
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:10,917
And there we also see an image
of her square from the quilt.

949
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:14,667
And here's what we know about
her from the museum records.

950
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:15,999
A single mother of two,

951
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:19,999
Julia Powell commuted
to Plymouth every week,

952
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,709
leaving Sunday afternoon
and returning Friday evening.

953
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:26,999
Her mother and father, Franca
and Blaz Skrube of Sheboygan,

954
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:29,750
cared for the children,
Charles and Sharon,

955
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,792
while Julie made her living
in Plymouth.

956
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:34,500
During the week,
she stayed in a rented room

957
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,458
and remembers that most
of the women she worked with

958
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:42,250
at Kraft were from rural farms
in the area.

959
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,208
So this object, this image

960
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,542
brings us to a very
particular moment in time,

961
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:50,999
a very particular moment
in Julie's life,

962
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,333
a very particular moment
in American history.

963
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,542
And so that's one line
of questioning

964
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:58,667
that we could pursue.

965
00:45:58,667 --> 00:45:59,999
We could think about
historical context

966
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:02,875
and really try to dive in
to think about women at work

967
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:06,667
on the home front
during World War II.

968
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,834
So we know that in this period,

969
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:11,999
many women started working
in new ways.

970
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:15,458
And we don't know Julie's
exact circumstances,

971
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:16,917
you know, if she
had worked before

972
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:19,625
or kind of exactly
what prompted her

973
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:20,458
to start working at this period.

974
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,667
But we assume it has
something to do with the need

975
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:26,542
for more labor in this
historical moment in the 1940s

976
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:30,000
as men are away at war.

977
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,125
But we do know for sure that
she was supporting her family

978
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,333
and contributing
to the war effort.

979
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,999
And this is a somewhat familiar
story in some ways, right?

980
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:42,083
I mean, we all know images
of Rosie the Riveter

981
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:43,250
from this period.

982
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,000
But those images, those stories
do not always include

983
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,125
women like Julie, who might be
working in the cheese factory.

984
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:52,500
They're not always
part of that story.

985
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,000
And I'm showing you here,
this is a small help wanted ad

986
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,041
from<i>The Sheboygan Press
</i> that I found, you know,

987
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:04,500
"Men and women wanted at Kraft
Cheese Company, Plymouth.

988
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,999
"Starting wages men,
58 1/2 cents per hour,

989
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:10,667
women, 44 cents per hour."

990
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:11,333
You know, apply there.

991
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,083
So we can also sort of think
about what is it like

992
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,208
to be a working woman
at this moment,

993
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,417
when ads like this are part
of the culture

994
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,999
where men and women
are routinely getting paid

995
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,999
different amounts, right?

996
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:26,959
And then looking
at these two images

997
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:29,875
from just a little bit
earlier this year,

998
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:33,000
these photographs
are centering and naming

999
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,834
the male factory workers
kind of in the foreground

1000
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:37,625
of the images, but look closely.

1001
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,667
And you'll see in the
background a woman

1002
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,208
in each of these images.

1003
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:41,959
In the bottom,

1004
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,959
a woman wearing a uniform
not unlike Julie's.

1005
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:48,625
But they're not foregrounded
in these stories, right?

1006
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,999
They're receding
into the background.

1007
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:54,875
These stories are not
often told, right?

1008
00:47:54,999 --> 00:48:00,291
So Julie ends up
leaving this job in 1943,

1009
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,999
and she gets married again.

1010
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:06,250
But in the next year,
we see even more conversations

1011
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,000
and newer conversations
with a different tone

1012
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,875
about what it meant
for women to work

1013
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:12,792
as part of the war effort.

1014
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:16,959
So this is just the next year
in the Sheboygan papers,

1015
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:19,458
ads for women working
in places like Kraft

1016
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,999
changed dramatically.

1017
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:24,792
We don't see that same kind
of ad describing

1018
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:25,999
how much men and women
are gonna make,

1019
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:29,208
but suddenly, women are wanted
for essential war work.

1020
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,333
The hours even are shifted
so you could do this work

1021
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:34,000
while your child might be
at school from 8:30 to 2:00 PM,

1022
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
like trying to really
think dramatically,

1023
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,999
"How do we do this," right?

1024
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,041
But there's a shift in tone.

1025
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:44,333
There are posters like this
really quite fabulous, you know,

1026
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,709
"soldiers without guns" image.

1027
00:48:46,709 --> 00:48:48,999
We start to see
new conversations

1028
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:49,625
about women at work.

1029
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,083
So you could go down this line
of questioning.

1030
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,959
This is a rabbit hole
you could follow

1031
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:57,208
to think about
Julie's story, right?

1032
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:01,999
But we also know that Julie
made wonderful friends

1033
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:03,750
while at Kraft.

1034
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,959
And as her daughter-in-law
remembered years later,

1035
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:09,999
she wanted to have something
to remember them by.

1036
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:12,999
And so what she did was
she asked each of these friends

1037
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:17,083
to embroider one cotton square
with their name on it.

1038
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:20,250
And the finished blocks
were to be made

1039
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,041
into a friendship quilt,

1040
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:25,166
which would commemorate
their time at Kraft.

1041
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,999
Now, as I've been able
to figure out in my research,

1042
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,999
in the 1940s, there were
a lot of friendship quilts

1043
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:32,542
circulating in Sheboygan.

1044
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:37,625
There was one made
by a 4-H club in 1942.

1045
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:40,709
There were quilts made
for wedding gifts,

1046
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:43,834
as raffle prizes for various
women's organizations.

1047
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:45,999
This was something that was
a pretty popular thing to do.

1048
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:49,917
So why not have the Kraft
Cheese House Gang make a quilt

1049
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:53,208
to remember their time
commuting into Plymouth,

1050
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:56,291
commuting on a Friday,
excuse me,

1051
00:49:56,291 --> 00:50:00,917
on a Sunday to a Friday
to do this work?

1052
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,417
And so that's something that
she asked her friends to do.

1053
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:08,917
And maybe she was inspired
by other quilts.

1054
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:13,083
Like this is an example
of an album quilt from 1943,

1055
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:17,333
quite similar to the
eventual result of this quilt.

1056
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,959
This was made by a group
of cousins in Ohio,

1057
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:21,917
with each cousin
creating a square

1058
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:24,291
that was then quilted together.

1059
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,875
So another kind of line of work

1060
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:28,083
that we could think about
is comparison.

1061
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,999
Another line of questions.

1062
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,000
What about similar quilts?

1063
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,999
What else is happening?

1064
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:34,542
Are other people
making similar objects?

1065
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:36,999
Or a quilt square
in our collection,

1066
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:39,333
also from the mid 20th century,

1067
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,999
thinking about these signatures
on this quilt,

1068
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:43,834
on this quilt square.

1069
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,250
So we could think about
textiles, community,

1070
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,083
context,
similar sorts of objects.

1071
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,834
So back to the quilt.

1072
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:56,709
We also might wanna ask
another line of questioning.

1073
00:50:56,709 --> 00:50:59,834
How was this made, okay?

1074
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:04,999
What was the process that was
used to create this object?

1075
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,834
Each square is different.

1076
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:11,792
And I was excited to actually
find some transfers

1077
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:15,542
that were likely used
on quilts like this one

1078
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:18,166
to help create
the various images

1079
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,792
that we see on the
different squares.

1080
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:23,917
So there were a series
of transfer prints,

1081
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,458
basically early
iron-on transfers

1082
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:30,208
that came with a subscription
to the periodical

1083
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,458
<i>Aunt Martha's Workbasket.</i>

1084
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,999
These were called
Numo Hot Iron Transfers.

1085
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:36,875
And each one had
different patterns.

1086
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,625
You could use them
multiple times.

1087
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,542
They could be reused,
they could be traded.

1088
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,999
You would get different patterns
every month.

1089
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,999
And so you could
kind of begin to see how,

1090
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,166
with a quilt like this,

1091
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,291
different women could use
different transfers

1092
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:54,458
and they could create
their own unique image.

1093
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:57,208
And I love these
because when we look

1094
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:58,667
at some of these quilt blocks,

1095
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,625
which I think
are absolutely charming,

1096
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:07,999
what we see are women thinking
about a particular style

1097
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,667
maybe of that moment,
but they're working it out

1098
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:11,458
in their own way.

1099
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:16,834
They're telling their own
unique story about this time.

1100
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,166
We have their nicknames,
there's Shorty,

1101
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:22,458
there's Squirt,
there's Johnny, right?

1102
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:25,625
We have Elma down here
reminding her friend,

1103
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:29,458
"Hi, babe,"
in this bottom square.

1104
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:31,917
And then there are women
like Evangeline

1105
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:34,667
here on the other square,
just "V for Victory"

1106
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:36,500
and the year, right?

1107
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:42,834
So each woman shows a unique way
of telling this story, right?

1108
00:52:42,834 --> 00:52:44,999
There might be these
mass-produced patterns

1109
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:46,000
that you could draw on,

1110
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,875
but you're still
telling your own story

1111
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,291
and you're doing it
in your own way.

1112
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,625
And that's a beautiful way
collections like this

1113
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,500
can help us connect the
individual, the local,

1114
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,667
the specific to the national
and the bigger stories, right?

1115
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:01,917
It's a really, really wonderful
way to see that in action

1116
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,500
with this object.

1117
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,208
Another wonderful way
to see that in action

1118
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:10,875
is to think about the women
who created this quilt.

1119
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:14,667
And it's just so remarkable
that this object

1120
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:17,041
is connected to these
photographs still.

1121
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:19,709
And that's just
such a wonderful,

1122
00:53:19,709 --> 00:53:20,834
wonderful reason why it's here.

1123
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:24,709
I mean, the museum is here
to care for these connections.

1124
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:25,834
It's a beautiful thing.

1125
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:28,999
So the women that we see here,
this network of women

1126
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:32,750
created this object from very
particular circumstances,

1127
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,834
a particular moment in time
that allowed them

1128
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:36,959
to tell their stories.

1129
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:40,000
And the women here in this
photograph, Elma, Lucille,

1130
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,999
Irene, Shorty, Tuttle, Marie

1131
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:45,959
created a number
of those squares below.

1132
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:48,709
Lucille apparently did not
get her quilt square in.

1133
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:51,375
And I have much empathy
for Lucille

1134
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:52,291
as I was going through this.

1135
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,166
I was like,
"Oh, she doesn't have one."

1136
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:55,750
It's okay.
[chuckling]

1137
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:59,458
But I feel like that
might be me.

1138
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:02,375
But how wonderful
to connect these images

1139
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,500
with these objects in this way.

1140
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,999
So we know from the object file

1141
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:10,083
that Julie collected the squares
from her friends.

1142
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:13,999
Then she left Kraft in 1943,
she was married again,

1143
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:16,291
she had two more children.

1144
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:20,041
Squares were not made
into a quilt, right?

1145
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:22,999
And I know many of us
might have unfinished objects

1146
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:23,999
laying around our homes.

1147
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,166
I have many people in my life
who are crafters

1148
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,166
who refer to these things
as UFOs, right?

1149
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:32,083
The unfinished objects that
kind of float around your home.

1150
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:35,625
So we understand these things
happen, right?

1151
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:36,999
And they ended up in the attic,

1152
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:42,375
where she found them at age 82,
decades later, okay?

1153
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,333
And it was her
daughter-in-law, Terri Erick,

1154
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,166
who actually completed
the quilt for her

1155
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,792
and donated it
to the museum in 1999,

1156
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:53,667
which I think is just
such a beautiful story.

1157
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:57,959
So this album quilt becomes
a really beautiful metaphor

1158
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:00,999
for the work that museums do,
right?

1159
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:03,083
They can keep and share stories,

1160
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,375
they can put pieces
back together,

1161
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,291
they can help surface
complex histories

1162
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,999
that might need
to be investigated.

1163
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:12,542
You know, I kept thinking
I wouldn't have gone back

1164
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,583
to something like that really
dramatic pay disparity.

1165
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,083
I wouldn't have been
looking up that topic

1166
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:22,834
had I not had this quilt to
send me down that path, right?

1167
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:28,458
You know, a quilt,
an object can do that.

1168
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:31,834
Objects like this can
become prompts for stories

1169
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:34,250
that might otherwise disappear,
right?

1170
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,875
And it's so wonderful
to have them here.

1171
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,750
As her daughter-in-law
Terri noted

1172
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,417
when she donated the quilt,
"Bringing the squares together

1173
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:46,500
"also brought these old friends
together again

1174
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,625
"and allowed their
fleeting connection

1175
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:49,999
"to travel through time,

1176
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:52,959
"creating a representation
of a long-ago world

1177
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:57,083
that becomes real and present
today through this object."

1178
00:55:57,542 --> 00:56:00,083
Now we kind of get to this point
by thinking about

1179
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,041
all of these different
material culture approaches,

1180
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:05,208
historical context, comparison,
thinking about process

1181
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:08,417
and making, thinking about this
object as part of a network

1182
00:56:08,417 --> 00:56:10,999
of things and people,
and the work of care

1183
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,999
that both Terri
and this museum did

1184
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,709
to make sure this object
got to this moment.

1185
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:18,417
But these are all different
material culture approaches.

1186
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,458
These are all various lines
of questioning

1187
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:24,999
that we can engage in together.

1188
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:29,542
And so this kind of textured,
object-based care

1189
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:33,250
is the work of museums like
the Sheboygan County Museum,

1190
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,750
and it's work that
we can all be part of.

1191
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,709
This work roots us in a place,
in a community.

1192
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:40,999
And the stories that
we find may be similar to,

1193
00:56:40,999 --> 00:56:43,625
or maybe echo, or might be
really different from,

1194
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:46,291
in some cases,
bigger national stories.

1195
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:50,125
But they can offer us a local,
rooted, personal meaning

1196
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:53,458
that reminds us of why
museums matter, right?

1197
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,792
These places help us
time travel.

1198
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,542
They help us understand
the big stories

1199
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:01,500
that can be rooted and focused
in well-cared for things,

1200
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,999
because caring for things
is truly, truly

1201
00:57:04,999 --> 00:57:08,208
one of the ways in which
we can care for community.

1202
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:12,041
So thank you.
