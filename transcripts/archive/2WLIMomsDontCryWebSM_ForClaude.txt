1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,903
[audience applauding]

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,476
- Takeyla Benton:
It's a rare thing

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,613
to get a glimpse of yourself
from the outside.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,148
All of your
hard work, love, devotion,

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,051
the sacrifices
and sleepless nights

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,786
and think,

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,989
"I'm a pretty
freaking awesome mom."

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,857
[audience laughs]

9
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,361
Well, [whoosh] this is not
one of those times.
[laughter]

10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,663
It's more like [whoosh]
one of those occasions

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,733
surrounded by half-folded
[whoosh, child's karate call]
baskets of clothes

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,902
and piles
of books and papers screaming,

13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,970
"Will you kids
just leave each other alone?

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,672
"WHY?
Why, why, why

15
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,974
am I always
stepping on Legos?"

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,976
[audience laughs,
Takeyla sighs]

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,044
"That's it!
Go to bed.

18
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,781
Everybody, just go to bed!"
[laughter]

19
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,385
I forced a smile,
recalling that day.

20
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,854
"It was an overwhelming day,"
I said to my son.

21
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,622
"I was very sad."

22
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,859
"But you didn't cry,"
my little guy responded.

23
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,394
"Moms get mad a lot,

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,462
but they don't cry."

25
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,364
In that instance,
I realized

26
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,466
how my kids
must've saw me.

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,901
Have I failed
to show my kids

28
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,371
it's okay to display emotions
in a constructive way?

29
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,639
Hmm...

30
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,441
Surely, I've cried
in front of my kids, right?

31
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,843
[purses lips]

32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,179
Well, when I was pregnant,
I remember crying <i>all the time.</i>

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,380
[laughing]

34
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,450
Those ASPCA commercials
get me every time.

35
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,519
[audience laughing]

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,754
But that was
late at night,

37
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,656
and I'm sure
my daughter was sleeping.

38
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,958
Maybe one
of the times

39
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,861
when the pain from my migraine
reached a fever pitch.

40
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,830
Probably not, since I prefer
to hide in the bathroom.

41
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,399
I tend to hide in the bathroom
a lot I think,

42
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,602
when that uncomfortable
emotional side of me

43
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,270
starts taking over.

44
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,972
Could that be why
my kids

45
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,608
refuse to allow me
any privacy in the bathroom?
[click, door creeks opens]

46
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,978
Even if I'm on the toilet,
they feel it's okay to burst in,

47
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,212
mid-argument,

48
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,281
forcing me to mediate
from the porcelain throne.

49
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,484
[kids yelling,
audience laughs]

50
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,687
Locking the door
doesn't help either.

51
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,457
I see little, tiny fingers
underneath the door.

52
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,192
[laughter]

53
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,995
They slide notes
under there.

54
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,162
[laughter]

55
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,732
Hear my son screaming,
"Mom, Mom,

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,001
"I know you're not
using the bathroom.

57
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,102
"You have your phone.

58
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,704
"I can see it.
[laughter]

59
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,872
"Poo particles!

60
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,742
Poo particles are getting
all over your phone."

61
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,945
[Takeyla and audience
laughing]

62
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,948
They don't know
that I'm Googling affirmations

63
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,117
because everything
that I know how to do

64
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,386
is not working
anymore.

65
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,321
I'm replaying
the last 14 years of my life,

66
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,856
trying to figure out
what went wrong.

67
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,725
And perhaps if I had cried
more in front of their dad,

68
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,360
he wouldn't have been
so distant.

69
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,729
He has told me on many occasions
that he felt

70
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,200
I was only open when I was
crying, and my guard was down.

71
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,102
Yet the thought that
my kids have not seen me cry

72
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,971
bothers me deeply.

73
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,208
It bothers me as deeply
as the constant tears

74
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,176
that are ingrained
on my shoulders

75
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,811
that my mother
cried on.

76
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,848
I knew early on I didn't wanna
be emotional like that.

77
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,851
I said, "I'd be a boulder
like my grandmother,

78
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,753
"who I only ever saw
shed a tear

79
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,957
for my father's
incarceration."

80
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,895
Even when I saw her
the last days of her life

81
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,599
laying in her hospital bed,
she looked at me and smiled,

82
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,802
and motioned for me to come
and sit next to her in the bed.

83
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,203
I couldn't.

84
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,738
I ran in the bathroom
and cried,

85
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,041
and I still regret that
to this day.

86
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,878
"Moms do cry,"
I told my son,

87
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,146
"Like when you leave your Legos
on the floor,

88
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,448
and I step on them."

89
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:38,485
"Or, especially, when your
sister uses up all the data,

90
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,788
yeah, I cry."
[audience laughing]

91
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,958
[speaking as son]
"No, no, you curse, Mom.

92
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,693
You don't cry."

93
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:51,632
Okay, note to self,
stop cursing, at least out loud.

94
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,400
[Takeyla and audience laughing]

95
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,769
Or perhaps the next time
I'm in the bathroom,

96
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,005
and one of them slides a note
under the door,

97
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,973
I'll write a reply back
that says,

98
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,675
"Mom is crying.

99
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,010
Do not disturb,"

100
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,878
and slide it
back out to them,

101
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,180
poo particles and all.

102
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,015
[audience laughing]

103
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,050
Thank you.
[applause]
