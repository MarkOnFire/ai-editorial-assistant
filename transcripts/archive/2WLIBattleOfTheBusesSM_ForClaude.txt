[blues rock

2
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,345
It's been said
countless times

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,114
that the wheels on the bus
go round and round.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,884
- Ellajanski:
It's kind of chaotic at first.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,720
- But on a Saturday evening
in New Richmond, Wisconsin...

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,789
- Dominic Harker: You never know
what's about to happen.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,728
- Angela: The wheels on these
buses go crash, bang, boom.

[rock music,
loud engines]

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:38,305
- Dominic Harker: It's kind of
just hold your foot to the floor

10
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,009
and pray
that everything goes right.

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,777
- Named Battle of the Buses,

12
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,280
this part-race,
part-demolition-derby

13
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,682
has become
an annual tradition

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,284
at Cedar Lake Speedway.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,687
- Brad Both:
Only happens once a year and you
can only see it this one time.

16
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,988
So, it's really fun.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,424
- Teams are given the task
of retrofitting

18
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,426
old, donated school buses

- Announcer yelling:
Here we go!

00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,434
- Trace: Oh, my God.

[spraying aerosol]

25
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,638
- And it's only fitting
that the people

26
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,341
these buses
were designed to transport

27
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,245
make up the crews
assigned with their destruction.

28
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,581
- Trace: There's a lot of people
working on this bus

29
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,250
and a lot of, like,
younger students.

30
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,118
- Angela: That's right.

31
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,989
Outside of the drivers,
the teams for each bus

32
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,758
are made up almost entirely
of high school students.

33
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,494
- Grant: That's pretty cool.

34
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,466
[electric guitar riffs,
pounding hammer]

35
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,736
- Brook Reyzer:
We strip it all out.

36
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,205
So, first things to come out
are all the seats,

37
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,608
all the windows,
the side paneling,

38
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,243
the roof,
the insulation.

39
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,045
- At St. Croix Central
High School,

40
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,348
the opportunity
to work on the buses

41
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,149
provides a chance
for some kids

42
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,952
to switch gears
and try something new.

43
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,787
- Peter Nusbaum:
They got to do some wiring.

44
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,922
They're working
on the engine.

45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,157
They're doing
some tuning.

46
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,560
Probably be a stack
coming out of this hood

47
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,428
probably after this weekend,
or so.

[angle grinder howling]

49
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,632
- Ellajanski: I had never used
angle grinder before,

50
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,035
and I just got handed to it
and did it.

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,006
- About 40 miles north,
at Unity High School,

52
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,175
students are getting
their own bus ready.

53
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,644
- Jake Lee: As soon
as they see the bus is in,

54
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,812
they run to my room
pretty much and say,

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,214
"When are we
working on the bus?

56
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,616
When are we working on the bus?"
[whirring]

57
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,453
- The buses compete in three
races throughout the event.

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,556
The first two races
are all about speed.

59
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:40,627
[pulsing electric bass,
electric guitar, and drums]

60
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,233
- Jake Lee: It seems like
you're going a lot faster

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,701
than you actually are.

62
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,570
Going around a dirt track
around the corners,

63
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,104
it seems like
I'm gonna tip over.

64
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,574
But the kids, when they
talk to me afterwards,

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,243
they're like, "Why were
you going so slow, Mr. Lee?

66
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,377
You're only going
like 35."

67
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,279
I'm like, "No way,
I wasn't going 35.

68
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,081
I was going
a lot faster than that."

69

[bus slams into another bus]

70
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,118
- The third race
is all about strength.

71
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,721
- Jake Lee:
It's not fun if we're
just racing around a track.

72
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,723
Nobody wants to see
a bus race around a track.

73
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,625
They want to see us
smash into people,

74
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,094
tip over,
all that kind of stuff.

75
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,730
- Announcer: Over there,
turn three, whoa!
[crowd cheers]

76
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,032
- Dominic Harker: The definition
turns like a dump truck

77
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,334
is true
in this circumstance.

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,669
- Jake Lee: My strategy is,
I tell the kids,

79
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,606
I don't want this bus to be
running by the end of the race.

[adrenaline-filled

81
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,080
- For these students,

82
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,349
when it comes
to high school milestones,

83
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,650
there's Battle
of the Buses,

84
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,920
and everything else
is a distant second.

85
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:43,390
- Jake Lee:
One year, we had the prom
the same night as the bus race,

86
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,460
and so a lot of the kids
were upset about that

87
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,295
and had to make
this big choice on,

88
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,030
"Am I gonna go
to the prom

89
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,832
or am I gonna go
to the bus race?"

90
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,968
There were several dates
that were a little upset

91
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,172
that they chose the bus race
over the prom, so...

92
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,040
- Angela: And like prom,

93
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,342
race night
promises to be a night

94
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,944
they'll likely
never forget.

[punchy snare drum]

96
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,783
- Brook Reyzer:
Most of the time,
I'm not even watching the track,

97
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,518
but I'm watching
these kids

98
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,387
and I'm watching
their families' faces.

99
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,189
I'm watching the littles,
you know,

100
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,391
look at
these high school kids

101
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,693
and dream about
doing this someday.
