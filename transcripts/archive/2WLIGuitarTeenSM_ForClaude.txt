00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,540
- Angela Fitzgerald: Pass by
this home in Pulaski

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,611
and the sound of a hammer
is a familiar tune.

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,480
Whether it's hammering wood...

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,048
[zipping]

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,818
...or hammering out a tune
on his guitar,

7
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,688
Ian Vanveen has a fascination
with both.

[gentle electric guitar music]

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,496
- Ian: I would describe the
sound of an electric guitar

10
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:34,468
to be very twangy, but also
very warm and just unique.

11
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:43,343
I really want to connect with
the instrument a lot more.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,946
- Angela: For Ian, his
connection to the guitar

13
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,681
is a family thing.

14
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,652
- This one was actually
my first guitar.

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,855
This was my dad's
old band guitar.

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,491
[hard rock music]

17
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:02,429
It made me feel like the coolest
rock star of all time.

18
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:06,934
Like, carried it real low, took
a basic, like, power cord,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,371
and I just, like, strummed it,
volume all the way up.

20
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,707
It was amazing.
[laughs]

21
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,643
- Angela: That amazing spark
propelled Ian

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,479
to explore the mechanics
of music.

23
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,715
- It's such an interesting
instrument.

24
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,517
It's so cool
because it's a blend

25
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:28,155
of a lot of physical vibrations
and electronics,

26
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,024
and it's so beautiful
how they work together.

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,327
[power sander buzzing]

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,995
- Angela: Out of curiosity,

29
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:40,400
he decided to actually make
electric guitars from scratch,

30
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,036
self-taught as a teenager.

31
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,775
- If I want the perfect guitar,
exactly what I want,

32
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,377
I might as well just make one.

33
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,214
I put a bunch of wood together
with my woodworking skills,

34
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,085
and I loosely knew
how to put it together.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,489
- Angela: This is the result
of Ian's hard work

36
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,458
and determination.

37
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,260
- This is the first guitar
I made

38
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,364
where I actually put a lot
of thought and energy into it.

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,300
But this one, I really had
a lot of fun with.

40
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,137
I made it into the thinnest
guitar I could possibly make

41
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,873
without it warping over time.

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,078
I really like the look of this
one being all rough and used

43
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
'cause it is very heavily used.

44
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:31,451
This one will always be
very deep in my heart.

45
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,889
- Anglea: Along the way,
Ian is improvising

46
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:40,327
and revolutionizing the way
guitars are made.

47
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,997
- I really like the idea
of customizing.

48
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,632
The switches, I like
to actually put 'em

49
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,367
on the side of my guitars.

50
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,969
'Cause I find that to be
more comfortable

51
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,472
and you won't hit 'em
when you're playing.

52
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,075
I don't wanna make
the most basic guitar.

53
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,277
I wanna make it modern.

54
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,981
- Angela: Ian's interest in this
instrument at a young age

55
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,183
is forging his future.

56
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,321
- Ian: I'm going into electrical
engineering next year

57
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,158
so I can really dig deep
into the circuitry of guitars

58
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,761
and then I can make really nice,
unique guitars.

59
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,830
[hammering]
- Angela: His perspective

60
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,366
on success is also unique.

61
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,204
I used to measure success
in just objects,

62
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,508
like money, cars, and stuff.

63
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,309
But now, I just measure success

64
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,846
in how content you are
with your life.

65
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,549
If you have the job
that you want,

66
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,618
if you have the people
that you want,

67
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,521
and if you're happy about it.

68
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,358
What I get out of this is,

69
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,095
just genuinely
a really fun thing to do.
