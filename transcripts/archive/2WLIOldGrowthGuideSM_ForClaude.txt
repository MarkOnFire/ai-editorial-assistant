[squirrel chittering]

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,372
- John Bates: People just
absolutely love

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,307
walking amongst these old trees.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,711
There's another good woodpecker
tree, yeah.

5
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:14,114
It moves your heart,
it moves your spirit.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,283
- Angela Fitzgerald: Follow
John Bates into the woods,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,420
and he'll make sure you won't
lose the forest for the trees.

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,155
- Child: Whoa!

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,360
- Angela: He will uncover
hidden details.

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,863
- And you can age it by the
distance between each

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,565
one of the new stems.

12
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,534
This was a good year.

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,370
- Angela: And illustrate
the big picture.

14
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,140
- So we're in what's called
a hemlock hardwood forest.

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,143
- Angela: John knows well that
whole forests in Wisconsin

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,879
have been lost, tree by tree.

17
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,516
- John: We cut down,
in northern Wisconsin,

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,219
tens of millions
of eastern hemlocks.

19
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,988
This was the number-one tree in
the Northwoods pre-settlement,

20
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,660
and now it represents 1% to 2%
maybe of the whole Northwoods.

21
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,263
- Angela: The Van Vliet Hemlock
State Natural Area is one spot

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,034
where these great trees still
loom above, making this

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,938
a rare example of remaining
old-growth forest.

24
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,606
[bird calling]

25
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,042
Finding the state's few
remaining pockets

26
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,879
of old-growth forest
set John on a mission.

27
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,814
- I just wanted
to find all these places.

28
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,482
It was an adventure for me.

29
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,384
It's joyful.

30
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,422
It was exciting to find places
that I didn't know about

31
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,290
and to be thrilled by them.

32
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,392
- Angela: Thrills he shares
on his tours.

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,395
- The song is "Sweet Tea."
[whistling]

34
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,431
- Angela: And in his guidebook.

35
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,834
- These trees are our
living ancestors.

36
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,337
They've been here
for a very long time.

37
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,939
These old trees
tie history together.

38
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,609
That time actually happened.

39
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,677
- Angela: But don't mistake
these ancient trees

40
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,479
for antiques.

41
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,048
- John: They're not something
fossilized

42
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,284
that we're looking at
in a drawer.

43
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,052
They're living,
but they're still

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,688
400 or 500
or more years old.

45
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,824
- What are they even dropping?

46
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,559
[John laughing]

47
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,197
- Angela: The hemlocks
are living, breathing.

48
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,398
- So what are you getting?

49
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,566
What are you finding?

50
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,901
- Angela: Trying to regenerate.

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,068
- So what are these?

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,770
- Child: They're hemlock cones,
I think.

53
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,606
- John: Young hemlock cones
right here.

54
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,442
- Angela: Old growth
spawns new growth.

55
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,480
A cycle of life that also
means accepting death.

56
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,815
- When somebody dies
and we mourn,

57
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,018
we grieve, and rightfully so.

58
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,221
But when a tree dies out here,
is allowed to die,

59
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:39,059
it has an ecological function
that's really significant.

60
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,728
And it should be celebrated.

61
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,730
All the salmanders now
living underneath there,

62
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:48,101
all those white-footed mice and
voles that are feeding every,

63
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,938
the barred owl
that was keeping you up.

64
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah, yeah, what do they eat?

65
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,009
- Angela: Toppled trees
nurture new ones.

66
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,045
- We'll see some old trees
completely covered in moss

67
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,248
and are called nurse logs
because they're nursing along

68
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,383
all these seedlings on top.

69
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,453
You can see the perfect
lineup of Eastern hemlocks,

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,856
and now we got a bunch
of yellow birch on this end.

71
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,024
- Angela: That lineup
of new life on a log

72
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,759
includes more
than growing trees.

73
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,561
- John: That a hand lens?
- Hiker: Yes.

74
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,829
- John: A tiny little mushroom.

75
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,565
- Angela: Forest life comes
in many sizes.

76
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,800
- John: It's worth looking at.

77
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,168
- Angela: And many shapes.

78
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,003
- John: Slime mold.

79
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,806
It's really weird looking.

80
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,307
This is called doll's eyes,

81
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,011
'cause, yeah, it looks like
doll's eyes, right?

82
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,480
This is white baneberry.

83
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,383
Try to eat it, it'll be the
bane of your existence.

84
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,118
[group laughing]

85
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,888
- Angela: A walk in the woods
with John Bates

86
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,290
includes lessons
about the forest,

87
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,160
but more importantly,
lessons from the forest.

88
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,264
- So the values
of old growth are many.

89
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,566
You can feel peace here.

90
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,003
And what's the value
of that peace?

91
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,172
- Angela: Peace is one thing
you can take

92
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,340
from a walk in the woods.

93
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,344
And that's something
that John shares gladly.

94
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,846
- John: Let me pass that on.

95
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,048
Opening up
that space to them,

96
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:12,352
to fall deeper in love
with the natural world.

97
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,322
