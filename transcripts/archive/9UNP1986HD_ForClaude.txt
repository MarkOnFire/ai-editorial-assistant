- Elaine Becker: Human legacy
of environmental damage

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:10,911
to the water, air, and ground
of this world is not one thing,

3
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,113
but nearly too many to count.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,616
Nevertheless, we still
must each face

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,384
the environmental challenges,

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,387
doing what each of us can
in our own way

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,690
to help preserve
our environment.

8
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,898
Good morning,
thank you for joining us today.

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,202
My name is Karen Mayhew, and
I'm a fourth-generation farmer,

10
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,204
a shepherd,
and I'll be finishing up

11
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,506
master gardener
certification next month.

12
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,674
[audience applauding]

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,644
Thank you,
life goal achieved.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,448
My day job is at the local
U.S. post office in our town,

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,250
and I grew up on a very large

16
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,120
market vegetable, cash crop,
and poultry farm

17
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,855
back in Maryland.

18
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,857
Now I farm sheep
with my family.

19
00:00:56,924 --> 00:01:00,727
We have about 25 acres
with a farm stay in our barn,

20
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,064
and miscellaneous chickens,
goats, cats, rabbits.

21
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,566
You name it, it's there.

22
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:09,970
And a flock of about 50
heritage breed sheep.

23
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,307
Now, 50 sheep
produce a lot of wool.

24
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,975
And although I spin and knit,

25
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,476
I'm always looking
for creative ways

26
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,547
to use that fiber
to keep it out of my garage.

27
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,151
So mostly I try to use it,

28
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,788
but a lot of it ends up in the
garden to benefit the soil.

29
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,656
So we'll talk to you
about that today.

30
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,726
And this
is my business partner.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,128
- I am Elaine Becker.

32
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,698
I'm an educator
and a librarian by day

33
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,168
at a tiny rural school
here in Wisconsin.

34
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,103
I received a BS
in environmental science

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,205
from Indiana University.

36
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,874
Go, IU.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,444
And I'm currently
becoming a master naturalist.

38
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,712
- Whoo-hoo!

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,615
- Growing up, my family had
extremely large gardens,

40
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,750
and I grew up watching
and helping my folks

41
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,586
preserve all the vegetables,
canning, drying.

42
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,956
We probably had fruit leathers
before anyone else

43
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,792
ever had
Fruit by the Foot roll-ups

44
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,828
or whatever that's called.

45
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,563
Many summer days,

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,633
my siblings and I
could be seen

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,570
picking beans,
weeding, mulching,

48
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,573
picking beans, weeding,
mulching.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,108
[all laughing]

50
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,510
And at the time,
I didn't appreciate it.

51
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,614
I did feel like
we ate like kings, though.

52
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,952
So I'm an environmentalist,
a plant lover,

53
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,887
a geeky prairie lover,

54
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,457
and I want the best
for our environment.

55
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,495
[audience applauding]

56
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,230
[Karen chuckles]

57
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,402
- So our company turns wool
into Woollets wool pellets.

58
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,672
We source our wool
from Wisconsin sheep farmers,

59
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,209
paying them a fair price and
adding revenue to their farms

60
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,643
and their families.

61
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,614
We divert that wool
from the waste stream.

62
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,417
And we shred it-- nope.

63
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,452
- Elaine: It sped through.

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,054
- Karen: Okay, well,
I'll just wing it.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,623
We shred that wool
in a machine

66
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,925
with nine whirling blades
of death.

67
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,628
Her name is Wilma, by the way.
[audience laughing]

68
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,831
And that turns the wool
into tiny pieces.

69
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:22,102
And then we pellet it
using heat and pressure

70
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,638
in Betty, our pellet mill.

71
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,143
All right, so, did I get--
oh, here we go.

72
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,445
Well, yeah, this...

73
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,113
I am very technologically
challenged, guys.

74
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,715
I'm terribly sorry.

75
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,719
So the wool pellets are
actually a lot easier to use

76
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,854
than storing whole fleeces.

77
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,557
And switching to wool is great
for your plants and your planet.

78
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,727
Wool is a sustainable
alternative to peat moss

79
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,097
for moisture retention,
and wool, unlike peat,

80
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,835
has lots of nutrients
for the soil and your plants.

81
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,440
- Elaine: In our first year
of business,

82
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,677
Karen and I have some things
to celebrate.

83
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:08,115
Woollets has diverted
18,000 pounds of wool

84
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,083
from the landfills.

85
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,351
Karen.
- Karen: Yes.

86
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,453
[audience applauding]

87
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,726
We have provided
Wisconsin shepherds a new market

88
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,796
for that
18,000 pounds of wool.

89
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,902
And finally,
in the fall of 2024,

90
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,805
we were nominated for
and won

91
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,409
a Wisconsin Innovation Award
for agriculture.

92
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,777
[audience applauding]

93
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,512
Thank you.

94
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,615
Little disclaimer,
We didn't expect to win.

95
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,918
We were going to the
UW celebration

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,522
for the hors d'oeuvres, and...

97
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,090
[audience laughing]

98
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,159
...and the live band.

99
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,262
And lo and behold,
we were surprised.

100
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:59,733
We were up against some
tough competition, but we won.

101
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,135
- Karen: It was exciting.

102
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,571
- So today,
we're here to talk to you

103
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,241
about the benefits
of using wool in your gardens.

104
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,009
First, we'll discuss peat

105
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,578
and the need for using
sustainable alternatives

106
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,816
due to peat's important function
as a carbon sink.

107
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,618
Next, we'll focus on nutrients

108
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,020
wool can provide
for your vegetables:

109
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:24,358
both macronutrients, which
plants need in large quantities,

110
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,093
as well as micronutrients,

111
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,428
which plants need
in smaller quantities.

112
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,830
We'll discuss soil life,

113
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,865
which plays a very
important role in the health

114
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,936
of your plants and the quality
of the vegetables you grow.

115
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,939
We'll talk about
moisture balancing.

116
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,841
We'll talk about aeration.

117
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,743
And finally,
we'll go over the different ways

118
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,146
to use wool
throughout each season.

119
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,018
In the overview,
I mentioned peat bogs.

120
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,153
Let me explain about peat bogs,

121
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,858
which are one of the world's
largest carbon sinks.

122
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:02,529
Carbon sinks hold and store or
sequester carbon in the ground,

123
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,632
keeping it out
of the atmosphere.

124
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,203
Carbon emissions
drive extreme weather.

125
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,470
According to the

126
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,807
National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration, NOAA,

127
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:19,213
CO2 is responsible for 76%
of the greenhouse gas emissions.

128
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,016
Some of our largest and best
carbon sinks are the oceans,

129
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,419
forests, and peatlands.

130
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,922
Peatlands are fantastic
for absorbing carbon

131
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,359
because there's no limit
on the amount of absorption.

132
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:36,597
Peatlands store more carbon
than rainforests.

133
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,332
That's incredible.

134
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,102
They're incredibly important
for our climate.

135
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,571
Digging up peat
releases their stored carbon

136
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,206
into the atmosphere,

137
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,408
it contributes
to warming temperatures,

138
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,912
and it accelerates
climate change.

139
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,984
Peat rebuilds at a tiny rate
of 1/16 of an inch per year.

140
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,255
These bogs are formed
over thousands of years,

141
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,124
taking centuries to develop.

142
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,095
Peat consumption is
far greater than peat creation,

143
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,797
making it unsustainable.

144
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,200
Peat is also harvested
using large equipment

145
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,636
powered by fossil fuels.

146
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,372
The main benefit of peat
is its use

147
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,776
as a moisture-retaining medium
and soil acidifier.

148
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,778
Peat is devoid of nutrients

149
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:29,516
and is mostly used
as a filler in potting soils.

150
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,720
Unlike organic materials
such as manure or compost,

151
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,455
peat, being devoid of nutrients,

152
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:39,193
doesn't contain any
helpful microbes for your soil.

153
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,130
So that means you can use peat
as an amendment to acidify

154
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,832
or retain some moisture,
but you can't use it alone

155
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,170
and expect the plants
will grow strongly and properly.

156
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,073
Peat is effectively
unsustainable for our garden use

157
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,244
since we desperately need it
to sequester carbon.

158
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,113
Let me share with you
another startling fact.

159
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,517
Peat bogs cover only 3%
of the Earth,

160
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,056
but they store 33%
of the world's soil carbon.

161
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,593
So we obviously need to stop
digging up the peat bogs

162
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:17,798
and instead let them be
the carbon sink our Earth needs.

163
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,367
Now, some of you
may have heard about

164
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,669
Canadian peat bogs
being sustainable,

165
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,906
and I know they have a fantastic
management program

166
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,475
with regards
to peat harvesting.

167
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:33,614
Currently, they indicate they
are in balance with consumption,

168
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,383
but that means
consumption can't increase,

169
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,152
and they're still harvesting
an incredibly important

170
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,889
and undervalued carbon sink.

171
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:47,261
My take on this is,
why harvest a distinct ecosystem

172
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,596
when we have
a waste byproduct

173
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,734
which is not only natural,
but sustainable, renewable,

174
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,670
and has
a multitude of other benefits?

175
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,071
Wool.

176
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:03,610
Wool has been found superior
to peat for amending the soil.

177
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,752
- Wool is also a carbon sink.

178
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,124
Up to 50% of the weight of wool
is carbon,

179
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,061
and when wool is incorporated
into the soil,

180
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,764
that carbon stays sequestered
in the ground

181
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,899
instead of the atmosphere.

182
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,603
And wool, unlike peat,
grows very quickly.

183
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,205
It's readily available,

184
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,740
it has to be sheared
every year,

185
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:38,879
and it's completely sustainable,
eco-friendly, and natural.

186
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:43,984
Wool sheep grow between 5
and 15 pounds of wool a year.

187
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:47,521
I can attest that my sheep do
nothing all day except eat,

188
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,357
poop, and grow wool,
but that's their job.

189
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,626
[audience laughing]

190
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,963
So wool is a natural
protein fiber from the follicles

191
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,765
of the sheep's skin,
much like human hair.

192
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,502
It's composed
of keratin-type proteins,

193
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,506
and chemically, these proteins
contain five elements:

194
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:10,244
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
oxygen, and sulfur.

195
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,480
And then these five elements
are further combined

196
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,449
into 19 amino acids.

197
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,989
An analysis of wool pellets
reveals an NPK profile of 902.

198
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,658
So let's break it down.

199
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,061
Nitrogen, the first number
of an NPK rating,

200
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,864
grows big plants
with lots of leaves.

201
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,101
The nitrogen in wool
slowly releases

202
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,737
due to that
fibrous quality of the wool,

203
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,039
and it breaks down very slowly.

204
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,641
For many vegetable growers,

205
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,511
the generous nitrogen,
virtually no phosphorus,

206
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,513
and the small amounts
of potassium

207
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,350
are an ideal combination
for their soil.

208
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:54,655
By comparison,
compost has 1% to 2% nitrogen,

209
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,359
and the poultry manure
is generally considered

210
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,228
to be one of the
highest nitrogens out there

211
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:03,764
of organic materials, 3%.

212
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,134
Cow and pig manure,
2% to 3%.

213
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,603
Plus, these are
hot fertilizers.

214
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,538
You have to compost
those manures

215
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,774
before you can
actually use them

216
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,610
because they will burn
your plants.

217
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,011
You get fertilizer burn
from that

218
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,180
due to the urine
and the ammonia in them.

219
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,585
But wool has an average
of 9% to 14% of nitrogen,

220
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,690
without any urine
or ammonia in it.

221
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,292
So it will never burn
your plants.

222
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,127
Wool is a cold fertilizer,

223
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,563
and you can add it
to your plants at any time,

224
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,765
at any stage of growth.

225
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,303
All right,
so let's go on to phosphorus.

226
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,405
Phosphorus is that
middle number,

227
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,573
and that's the nutrient

228
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,209
that produces lots more flowers
and fruit.

229
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,712
It's also essential
for strong root growth

230
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,847
early in the season
for your plants.

231
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:57,050
However,
with farmers putting manure

232
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,621
on top of their soil
year after year after year,

233
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:05,492
we've developed a problem
called legacy phosphorus.

234
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,796
This means that there's too
much phosphorus in the ground,

235
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,165
and when you have
too much phosphorus,

236
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,034
it starts to bind
to the sediment,

237
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,569
and it can cause sickly plants

238
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:18,038
because your plants
can't pick it up.

239
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:21,175
Also, too much phosphorus
finds its way into our water,

240
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,577
causing water quality problems.

241
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:24,978
You may remember
a few years back

242
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,747
when they took all
of the phosphates

243
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,916
out of our laundry detergent
and our dish soap,

244
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,651
things that make it suds.

245
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,754
It's because we have far too
much into our water already.

246
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,189
At our farm,

247
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,858
we can't put, ever,
any phosphorus on the soil,

248
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,026
or it'll turn it toxic.

249
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,894
There's that much in there
from years and years

250
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,664
of corn, bean, and manure,
and corn, bean, and manure.

251
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,165
So it's something

252
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,267
that we're working on
by using our sheep

253
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:52,239
for regenerative grazing
to build the land back up.

254
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,941
And remember the quote
at the beginning?

255
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,710
"Everything is connected."

256
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,612
Potassium, the third number,

257
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,681
helps plants process
all of their nutrients

258
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:01,849
more efficiently,

259
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,618
and it improves the quality
of fruits

260
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,888
and just general development
for the plants.

261
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,557
All right, so we've covered
the macronutrients.

262
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:14,061
Now let's move on
to the micronutrients.

263
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,697
People often only
talk about the macronutrients

264
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,100
and don't really consider
the necessary micronutrients

265
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,402
that are needed
for plant growth.

266
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,071
The following are some,

267
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,274
but not all, of the
micronutrients that are in wool.

268
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,542
Calcium.

269
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,710
Calcium is a mineral

270
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,712
that's very important
for cell structure,

271
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,015
stress response,
and disease resistance.

272
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,485
Calcium activates the enzymes
involved in germination

273
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,320
and other processes,

274
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,991
and it also improves water
penetration within the plant.

275
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,060
Calcium helps maintain
pH levels

276
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,797
as well as stimulating
the root growth,

277
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,568
which improves
other conditions as well

278
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,470
and overall plant development.

279
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,306
And it helps
with nitrogen fixation.

280
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,208
And if you're a tomato grower,

281
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,810
you know
that calcium is essential

282
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,613
to prevent blossom-end rot.

283
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,149
We've been told
to crush up our eggshells

284
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,586
and put 'em in the soil,
but if you put wool in instead,

285
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,221
it's gonna break down
a lot faster

286
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:18,091
and you will have less
of the blossom-end rot.

287
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,393
Iron.

288
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,129
Iron is involved
in chlorophyll, enzyme,

289
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,964
and protein production,

290
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,568
as well as energy transfer,
receiving oxygen,

291
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:31,138
and overall plant development
and health.

292
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,806
Zinc is a mineral

293
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,243
that is important
for the metabolism of plants

294
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,246
and enzyme function
and ion transport

295
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,414
within the plant,

296
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,317
which is moving proteins
across the membrane

297
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,087
for growth
and for cellular communication.

298
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,024
And then we have sulfur,

299
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,294
which is essential
for growth functions,

300
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:58,899
including protein production
and chlorophyll formation.

301
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,703
Copper is one of the eight
essential micronutrients

302
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,438
that plants need.

303
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,108
Copper is required for many
enzymatic transactions

304
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,510
and activities in the plants,

305
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,012
and for chlorophyll
and seed production.

306
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,881
A deficiency in copper

307
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:17,751
can lead to increased
susceptibility to disease.

308
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:21,522
Folic acid is a nutrient that's
important for seed germination,

309
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,325
stress tolerance, and the
formation of chlorophyll.

310
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,795
Pyridoxine is a nutrient
important for root development

311
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,131
and stress tolerance.

312
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,666
And then selenium.

313
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:36,370
Selenium is not essential,
but it's very beneficial.

314
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,672
It protects
against abiotic stresses,

315
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,508
and selenium
can help plants tolerate cold,

316
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,644
drought, and desiccation.

317
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,147
It helps improve
the photosynthesis capability,

318
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,616
and it can reduce
oxidative stress

319
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,085
and helps maintain
cell structures.

320
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,321
Here in at least the
south central,

321
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:55,989
southwestern part of Wisconsin,

322
00:15:56,056 --> 00:16:00,093
we are actually
selenium deficient in our soils.

323
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,497
But sheep also need
a lot of selenium.

324
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:07,334
And so all sheep in Wisconsin
are supplemented with selenium.

325
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,236
So adding that wool in
releases the selenium

326
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:13,540
and keeps your soil
from being too deficient.

327
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,779
All right, so now, let's talk
about the soil life.

328
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,781
Soil life,
or the micronutrients,

329
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,116
or microorganisms in the soil

330
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,486
are what make the nutrients
available to the plants.

331
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,255
High levels of organic matter

332
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,592
are essential
to feed the soil microorganisms,

333
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,795
and it leads to healthy growth
of all your plants.

334
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:37,231
So if you're preparing
a fertilization plan,

335
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,800
that's why you want to start
with one to two inches

336
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,269
of a high-quality compost.

337
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,606
And then mixing
in an organic matter like wool

338
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,241
will actually boost
the soil life

339
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,176
because it can feed them.

340
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:53,881
Overusing synthetic fertilizers
can also harm soil structure

341
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,885
and reduce the population
of beneficial microorganisms,

342
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,221
so that negatively impacts
your soil's fertility

343
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,056
and long-term health,

344
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,727
making it less productive
for future plant growth.

345
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,862
A natural fertilizer like wool

346
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,032
supports the soil health
and fertility,

347
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,902
as well as increasing
the actual soil structure

348
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,770
as it biodegrades.

349
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:20,307
Together, soil texture
and structure

350
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,710
are what have the greatest
influence on the pore space

351
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,145
of your soil,

352
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:31,118
and how easily air and water and
roots can move through the soil.

353
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,657
- Wool is a hygroscopic fiber,

354
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,527
and that means it takes up
moisture in vapor form.

355
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:44,698
Tiny pores in the epicuticle
make the fiber semi-permeable,

356
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,300
allowing the vapor
to pass through

357
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,635
to the heart of the fiber.

358
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:54,541
Wool can easily absorb up to
30 times its weight in moisture

359
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,377
without feeling damp or clammy.

360
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,381
But wool is also hydrophobic,

361
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:05,319
and that means it repels
the water.

362
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,988
Wool always absorbs moisture
from the atmosphere

363
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:11,325
of greater humidity and releases
it to the drier environment

364
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:15,395
as it creates a balance
in moisture conditions.

365
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,598
As you know, extreme weather
has been creating

366
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:22,936
both too much water at times and
not enough water at other times.

367
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:24,238
By using wool,

368
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,140
you'll be providing better
protection for your plants

369
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,178
because the wool has the ability
to handle the wild swings

370
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:33,046
in precipitation.

371
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,884
It can absorb, hold,
and release that moisture,

372
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,786
as well as nutrients,
over time.

373
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,121
Think of the recent droughts,

374
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,823
as well as the
torrential downpours

375
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,925
that we've had recently.

376
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,227
How much more protected
would your plants have been

377
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,564
if they had had some wool
in the soil?

378
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:55,135
The hygroscopic and hydrophobic
characteristics of wool

379
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:58,906
are what makes it so magical
for our gardens.

380
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,074
Roots need space to grow.

381
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,576
When soil is compacted,

382
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,611
the roots struggle
to obtain the nutrients

383
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,680
they need for proper growth,

384
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,249
water has a difficult time
getting to the roots,

385
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,584
and the roots are just pushing

386
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,387
against the compaction
to expand.

387
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,621
By using pelleted wool,

388
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,057
the pellets create
air pockets in the soil,

389
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:21,128
allowing space for the water,
nutrients, and root growth,

390
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,030
thereby boosting
the structure of the soil

391
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,365
that Karen
was talking about earlier.

392
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,334
Soil structure's
an important physical property

393
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,003
that influences water
and nutrient flow,

394
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,039
aeration to plants
and microbes,

395
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,508
and resistance
to soil erosion and compaction,

396
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:38,045
which all affect
your plant's growth.

397
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,814
Wool releases nutrients,
holds and releases water,

398
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,816
all the while breaking down.

399
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,886
And as it's breaking down, it's
creating the space and pathways

400
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,955
that our plants need.

401
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,958
Wool pellets take
about six months to a year

402
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,193
to break down completely
in the soil,

403
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,662
so you're giving your plants
better soil structure

404
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,931
and immense potential
for growth

405
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,335
with the aid
of wool pellets yearly.

406
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:08,075
There are many reasons
people grow their own food.

407
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,477
Many people
like the fresh flavor.

408
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,446
Others enjoy spending time
in nature

409
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:16,283
or breathing in
those delicious microbes.

410
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,085
Another reason many of us
grow our own food

411
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,253
is that we wanna know

412
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,389
where our food comes from
and what goes into it.

413
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:26,026
We wanna put good food
into our bodies.

414
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,631
Polybeads, or what
you might know as hydrogels,

415
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:34,368
are those little colored balls
we find in our starter plants

416
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,004
and potting mixes
from the stores.

417
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,108
These polybeads soak up to
500 times their weight in water,

418
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,177
and then they
gradually release it.

419
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,879
That sounds great, right?
Holding and releasing water.

420
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,881
That's what we're talking about
with wool.

421
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,383
It sounds great.

422
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,251
Well, not so great.

423
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,888
First, there's conflicting
research indicating

424
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:59,193
that their effectiveness
is not as great as is stated.

425
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,995
Different factors
like soil conditions

426
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:05,832
or the presence of fertilizer
affect its ability to retain

427
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,901
and release that moisture.

428
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:10,571
Secondly, these synthetic
products are made

429
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,674
of a substance called
polyacrylamides,

430
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,077
which is considered nontoxic
when it stays intact.

431
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:18,846
But it's also biodegradable

432
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:22,382
in a not so
environmentally friendly way.

433
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,651
That's where
polybeads become a problem.

434
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:27,788
You see, polyacrylamide
is built from many molecules

435
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,456
of acrylamide,

436
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,692
and acrylamide is
a known neurotoxin

437
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,428
and probable carcinogen.

438
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,863
Some experts believe

439
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:38,465
that degrading polyacrylamides
could pose a risk

440
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:39,900
to the health of humans,

441
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:44,071
and in fact all animals
as they biodegrade.

442
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,474
They also take years
to biodegrade,

443
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,744
and so that's years
your plants are taking that in

444
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:54,248
from the soil, and then
you're eating the plants

445
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,584
that have taken it in
from the soil.

446
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:01,088
Some fertilizers also have
synthetic resins in them.

447
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,223
Synthetic resin
is a bonding agent

448
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,326
and is the main component
in plastic.

449
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,562
It not only bonds together
its own structure,

450
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:11,465
but it also bonds
other materials together

451
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:13,433
tightly and firmly.

452
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,137
I'm not sure why we need that
in our fertilizer.

453
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,640
Wool, on the other hand,
is a completely natural way

454
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,743
to feed your plants
as well as hold moisture.

455
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,678
It biodegrades in a natural way

456
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,780
in 6 to 12 months
in pellet form,

457
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:31,752
enriching the soil safely
and increasing soil life.

458
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,357
- Karen: All right,
so let's move on

459
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,494
to the down-and-dirty ways
of using wool in your garden.

460
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,696
Did you catch what I did there?
[aduience laughing]

461
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:45,132
[laughing]
Winter sowing.

462
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,267
Has anybody heard
of winter sowing?

463
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,736
I believe there was a talk
on this yesterday.

464
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:55,442
I love winter sowing, especially
for, like, my perennials.

465
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,377
So the technique,
if you haven't heard of it,

466
00:22:57,444 --> 00:23:01,114
is using milk jugs
as mini greenhouses.

467
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:05,586
You plant your seeds in there,
stick 'em out in the snow,

468
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:06,753
and forget about 'em.

469
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,122
And in the spring: plants!

470
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,557
It's wonderful.

471
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:13,160
It's like getting free plants.

472
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:17,364
I particularly do perennial
seeds that have a hard seed coat

473
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:19,466
because they need
that stratification

474
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,034
or the freeze-thaw cycling

475
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:25,572
in order to crack the seed coat
so that the seeds can germinate.

476
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,808
Adding wool
to your seed starting mix

477
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,777
when you're planting your little
greenhouses is a great way

478
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,715
to keep the soil consistently
moist so that it can stratify,

479
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,751
because it can't stratify
if the soil gets too dry,

480
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,753
and then it prevents it
from drying out

481
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,389
and killing off your
newly-sprouted seeds,

482
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:45,158
and it releases nutrients
to the new seedlings

483
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,895
after you transplant it
out into the garden.

484
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,396
If you have a greenhouse,

485
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:54,334
you can add the wool into
your soil mix for that as well.

486
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:59,840
You wanna use about one-third
to one-half a cup of pellets

487
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,808
into a gallon of soil,

488
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:05,412
and that'll keep your pots
from drying out.

489
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:09,650
Now, if you've discovered
soil blocking...

490
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:12,052
Have you discovered
soil blocking yet?

491
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,220
No?

492
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,022
Stop by the booth,
I'll show you the tool.

493
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,190
It's very cool.

494
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,927
So soil blocking
is where you use a form,

495
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:21,995
up there on the screen,

496
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:24,665
and you press it
into your soil mix

497
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,400
and then click it out,

498
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,036
and you have
little square cubes of soil,

499
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,271
and then no plastic containers.

500
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,540
So remember buying plants
at the garden center,

501
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:34,942
especially near
the end of the season

502
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,276
and you're catching them
on sale?

503
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,478
And you pull those poor
little things out of the pots,

504
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:41,849
and they are round
and round and round with roots.

505
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,384
That's because the roots
didn't have anywhere else to go.

506
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,955
So when you have a soil block
and you put plants in there,

507
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,823
the roots naturally air prune.

508
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,725
So they get to the edge
of the soil,

509
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,728
and then they start
branching out inside the block,

510
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:57,931
and you get a much firmer,
sturdier root ball,

511
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,766
which means
a much healthier plant

512
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,002
because it can actually
take up so much,

513
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,037
so many more nutrients
with all the extra,

514
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:05,906
all the extra roots in there.

515
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,943
So the more roots a plant has,
the healthier it's going to be,

516
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,045
and less transplant shock

517
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,847
when you're not taking it
out of a container

518
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:16,450
to expose it to the air and
then plunking it in the ground.

519
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:19,520
They really seem to respond well
to soil blocking.

520
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:23,290
When I mix up a soil mix
for soil blocking,

521
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,026
I like to use
one part pellets

522
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:30,797
to four parts
of a peat-free potting mix.

523
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,801
I've used Coco Loco,
which is made from coconut coir,

524
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,572
and a new one that we've found
called PittMoss,

525
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:41,108
which is made
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

526
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:44,011
and it's made using
only cardboard.

527
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,579
And adding those two together,

528
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:49,249
the wool helps bind the soil
and hold the moisture,

529
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:53,654
and it's doing great things
for our seedlings.

530
00:25:58,892 --> 00:25:59,993
In the springtime,

531
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,429
you can add wool
directly into your garden

532
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,264
when you're sowing your seeds.

533
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:06,600
Just sprinkle them in.

534
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,069
The wool will help
the germination rates.

535
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,905
Planting seeds directly with
wool help seedlings establish

536
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:15,309
by keeping them consistently
moist for good germination

537
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,045
and early growth,
plus the nutrients.

538
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:19,713
No more dried-up seedlings

539
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,052
because you missed a day
checking on them to water them.

540
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,654
You can mix wool into your soil
when you're transplanting

541
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,990
to help the transplants get off
to a great start

542
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,426
with the nutrients
and moisture retention,

543
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:36,096
reducing transplant shock with
the help of the micronutrient,

544
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:39,967
Karen discussed,
selenium and folic acid.

545
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:43,737
When wool is put into the
root zone of the plants,

546
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,839
the nutrients are going
immediately to where

547
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:49,209
the plants can take up
those nutrients.

548
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,946
Calcium is gonna help with
stimulating root growth too.

549
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:55,282
So make sure you're putting
pellets in with the roots

550
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,686
to get the biggest bang
for your buck in growth.

551
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,591
Another way
to use wool in the springtime

552
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,360
is by adding a thin layer
of wool

553
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,862
at the bottom of your planters
to hold moisture

554
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,564
and prevent soil
from running out

555
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:14,101
if you have holes
in the bottom of the pots.

556
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,136
We've had a couple cities
use our product

557
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,704
to reduce the amount of watering

558
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,873
they need to do
on a large scale.

559
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,543
And if you're like our,
[clearing throat] pardon me,

560
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,679
if you're like our town,
water is pretty expensive,

561
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,915
so you wanna reduce
your watering costs

562
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:31,418
and use less water
to save the planet.

563
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,023
If you're a fan
of straw bale gardening,

564
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,225
you can add a scant handful
of wool pellets

565
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,893
into your starter plants

566
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,962
when you plant them
into the straw bales,

567
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,165
and you'll notice your plants
stay moist for longer periods,

568
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,401
reducing your water usage.

569
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:50,070
And if you're planting
the seeds into your straw bale,

570
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,005
place a few pellets in
with each seed

571
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,974
to help with the germination.

572
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,377
Remember the micronutrients
of calcium and folic acid?

573
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,379
You wanna use that.

574
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:02,015
And you can use fleece mulch
around your vegetable plants

575
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:04,751
to help retain more moisture.

576
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,222
Already established
perennial plantings

577
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,490
can benefit from
a top dressing of wool pellets

578
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:14,394
mixed in around the base
as slow-release fertilizer.

579
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,662
In addition,

580
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,564
you can also mulch around
already established plants

581
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:20,367
with the raw fleece
to maintain soil temperature,

582
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:24,471
shade the roots,
and provide moisture retention.

583
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:27,407
Just remember
that wool insulates.

584
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:30,410
So if you want the soil
to heat up,

585
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:35,816
allow the sun to do its work
before you lay your mulch down.

586
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,486
And if you love sweet potatoes
like I do,

587
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,823
you can use wool pellets to
begin your sweet potato slips.

588
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,427
Since sweet potatoes love moist,
humid conditions,

589
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,897
wool is the perfect,
perfect element

590
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,867
for keeping
those conditions just right.

591
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:56,970
My husband loves trees.

592
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,505
We have a tree farm,

593
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,408
and when he's transplanting
the little seedlings,

594
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:03,944
he always throws in
some wool pellets

595
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:07,814
to get those baby trees
off to a great start.

596
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:13,787
It provides consistent moisture
and slow-release nutrients.

597
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,059
- All right,
so now we're moving into summer.

598
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:22,496
Your garden plants are off to
a great start and growing well.

599
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:26,266
If you lay some raw wool
around your plants as mulch,

600
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,603
it will suppress the weeds
and shade the roots,

601
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,572
keep the soil from drying out,

602
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:36,143
and protect tender plants
from slug and snail damage.

603
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,878
Yes.
[laughing]

604
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:41,014
The fibrous quality
of the wool

605
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:43,083
keeps the slugs
and snails away.

606
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,620
Unshredded raw wool
on top of the garden as mulch

607
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,755
will generally last
a couple of seasons

608
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:51,758
if you leave it in the garden
before it starts to break down.

609
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:54,094
You can take it up
at the end of the season,

610
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,563
make sure it's dry,
and then store it

611
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,532
for the next year
to use again.

612
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,568
And you can usually get three to
four years out of it that way.

613
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,370
Or you can mix it
into your compost pile

614
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,807
at the end of the season
to break down a little faster.

615
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:08,909
If you do
leave it on the garden,

616
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,745
I will caution you
that it will really tangle up

617
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:15,215
in your rototiller tines.
[audience laughing]

618
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,518
Yeah, experience speaks there.

619
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:20,320
You will also have
a few weed seeds in the wool

620
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:23,156
because sheep like to wear
their food as well as eat it.

621
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:27,160
But any that sprout in the mulch
layer are very easy to pull out.

622
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:31,665
I did rows of wool fleece
for mulch in my garden this year

623
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:35,536
and rarely had
any seeds sprout in the wool,

624
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:40,807
although between the rows where
I didn't put any were overrun.

625
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:42,910
You can continue
sprinkling in wool pellets

626
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,511
with your
succession plantings

627
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:47,181
of your summer and fall
vegetables and fruits.

628
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,783
That's very important
at this time of year.

629
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,085
And I'm one of those people
that forgets to go back

630
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:57,391
and check on them for a day,
and then they're toast, so...

631
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,359
And hanging baskets.

632
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:01,128
We love them,
they're gorgeous,

633
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,363
and then they're fried-up
little crispy things.

634
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,165
During a hot, dry spell,

635
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:08,402
you have to water most of your
hanging pots and containers

636
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:10,404
multiple times a day.

637
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,506
But adding some wool
into the soil

638
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:16,577
will make a huge difference
in the amount of water needed.

639
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:19,313
It'll keep your plants happy
and stress free,

640
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,849
and it will also,
as the wool breaks down,

641
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:23,750
aerate and give them
a little more room

642
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:27,821
to grow for the roots, as well
as slow-release fertilizer.

643
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,992
You know, when you buy
a premade basket or pot,

644
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,261
they're really crammed
in there tight,

645
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:37,331
and they're given a whole bunch
of chemical fertilizer

646
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,333
in there to get them started,
so they look great.

647
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,902
But then halfway through
the summer, they're struggling.

648
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,771
So adding the wool in
keeps that going for them,

649
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:49,643
and as it breaks down,
it gives them a lot more space.

650
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:58,485
Okay, and as we have
the torrential downpours

651
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,922
that we got in last year,
holy biscuits,

652
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:04,591
your plants are, your pots
are overrunning with water.

653
00:32:04,658 --> 00:32:07,027
Remember that wool
gathers moisture.

654
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,363
So it not only
absorbs the moisture

655
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,699
and pulls it away from the roots
so your roots can breathe,

656
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,434
but then it will
release it back in

657
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,737
so you're not losing
any of that water,

658
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:20,474
and your plants are
a lot less stressed.

659
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:25,479
I sort of conducted
an experiment

660
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,948
in my vegetable garden
last year.

661
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:30,684
Half the garden
was planted with wool

662
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,252
mixed in with the transplants,

663
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,189
and then half the garden
was just planted quickly

664
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,990
without wool because
I was running out of time

665
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:38,792
and I needed to get them
in the ground.

666
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,229
And I am a notoriously
lazy waterer.

667
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,864
As you can see from the photo,

668
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:46,934
there's drip tape
spread out in the garden.

669
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,269
I didn't actually hook it up.

670
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:52,573
So the garden got watered
about three times all summer.

671
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,142
The big, beautiful plants
that you see

672
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:57,544
are the ones
that were planted with the wool,

673
00:32:57,611 --> 00:33:00,347
and the mostly bare half
of the garden is

674
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:02,349
where the plants without wool
were planted,

675
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:05,085
and, sadly, they died
a tragic death by mid-July

676
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,387
and had to be pulled out.

677
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,191
Some shepherd friends of mine
in Minnesota

678
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,926
also conducted
their own experiment,

679
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,062
and they sent us pictures
of the results.

680
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:18,031
They planted two
identical beds of tomato plants,

681
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:20,601
but mulched one
with a layer of their wool

682
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:24,271
and mulched the other
with newspapers and straw.

683
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,306
The wool bed plants
were much bigger

684
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:29,243
and darker green
than the newspaper straw bed

685
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,111
as the plants grew.

686
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:35,215
And when harvest time came
in early September,

687
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,718
the wool mulch
clearly outperformed

688
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:41,021
all of the
newspaper and straw bed.

689
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:44,024
And the wool bed was
still producing tomatoes

690
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:46,059
at the end of September,

691
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:50,330
when the newspaper straw bed had
finished up two weeks before.

692
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:53,700
- Elaine: Wool offers benefits
for the fall garden too.

693
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,203
Mulching around
your perennials with wool

694
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,639
protects them
from winter damage.

695
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,608
Just like a wool sweater
keeps you warm and insulated,

696
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,944
a layer of wool mulch
around your plants

697
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:06,346
helps insulate them too.

698
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:09,850
Mixing in wool pellets or shreds

699
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,519
around established perennials
in the fall

700
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,521
gives the soil
a boost of nutrients

701
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:18,158
that will be available in time
for spring growth.

702
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:23,230
Get all those plants off
to a great start in the spring.

703
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,501
When transplanting
divided perennials,

704
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:28,902
remember to mix wool
in around them

705
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,072
just like you do
in the springtime.

706
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,107
And you can add wool
along with any bulbs

707
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:37,110
you have ready to plant
in the fall.

708
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:38,712
If there are any plants you like

709
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,581
to bring indoors
for the winter,

710
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,482
maybe some
of your favorite herbs

711
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:45,819
and have an herb garden
in your kitchen.

712
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:49,389
My husband's grandfather,
he was in northern Illinois,

713
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:53,961
and he liked to bring in
a lemon tree every fall

714
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:57,164
and roll it out
in the springtime.

715
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,902
It actually produced
a few lemons.

716
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,972
But I often wonder what
his production would have been

717
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:08,709
if he had had wool
to put in there, but...

718
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:11,678
Finally, for those of you
who like to mulch with leaves,

719
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:14,882
leaves can blow away unless
they're wet and matted down.

720
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,984
Wool won't blow away.

721
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,052
If you don't like
the aesthetics of wool,

722
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,358
you can always add a light layer
of wood chips to cover it.

723
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,194
Sheep produce not only wool,

724
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:31,598
but a greasy or waxy substance
called lanolin.

725
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,902
Lanolin protects
their wool and skin

726
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,938
from harsh
environmental conditions.

727
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,208
We can use the lanolin
in the wool to our advantage

728
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:42,442
as a repellent,

729
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:45,946
since some animals
don't like the smell of lanolin.

730
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,849
Using wool around plants
will deter deer

731
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:54,054
since they are one of the
animals that don't like lanolin.

732
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:57,424
Rabbits are another garden pest

733
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:01,461
that will be deterred when
you use wool in your garden.

734
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:04,831
Shout-out to our friend Carolyn
who created that graphic for us.

735
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:06,567
It's hilarious.

736
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:11,538
And finally, if you have
a problem with slugs and snails,

737
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:13,340
the lanolin
and the barbed structure

738
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,409
of the wool fibers
irritates them.

739
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,144
So tuck some wool
around your shrubs,

740
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:20,547
potato plants, hostas,
arborvitae

741
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:24,518
to help your plants
from being snacked on.

742
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,289
There's a new lanolin-based
deer repellent out in Europe.

743
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,824
My take on this is,

744
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:34,161
why buy something
that's been refined

745
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:37,698
when you can have
the real McCoy with wool?

746
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:40,567
Another advantage of using wool
over a spray repellent

747
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,603
is that you don't need
to reapply it

748
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:44,438
every time it rains.

749
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:49,309
The lanolin stays on the wool,
and it keeps working.

750
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,079
Houseplants.

751
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,614
When you're
repotting houseplants,

752
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,415
you can mix wool
into the soil

753
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,618
for slow-release nitrogen
and micronutrients

754
00:36:57,684 --> 00:37:00,420
to ease any transition stress.

755
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:04,258
If you aren't gonna repot,
which is my go-to always,

756
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:06,994
use your finger,
a pencil, chopsticks,

757
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,729
a spoon handle,

758
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:12,733
and make little holes around
the base of your plant

759
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:17,137
and just drop the pellets in
and cover them back up.

760
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:19,039
By inserting the wool
into each divot,

761
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:21,341
you're creating that aeration,

762
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:26,046
and you're giving them a
much-needed boost of nutrition.

763
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:31,018
Houseplants can give us
a boost during a long winter,

764
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,521
but our houseplants can suffer
from overly dry indoor heat

765
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:38,325
or suffer at the hands
of forgetful waterers.

766
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:40,160
By adding wool to the soil,

767
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:43,597
you're gonna maintain
that soil moisture longer,

768
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:46,567
but you can water less as well.

769
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,836
And adding wool
on the top of the soil

770
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,637
adds to the humidity
around the plant

771
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:53,841
because wool
attracts moisture.

772
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:58,111
I realized last year,
a big deal with houseplants

773
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:02,182
was to cover the soil,
and I don't know why,

774
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:05,052
but a lot of people
last year were buying the fleece

775
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:09,323
so that they could cover
their soil in the houseplants.

776
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,992
I don't have a problem
with covering my soil.

777
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:15,329
I like to see the soil,
I like to smell the soil.

778
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:16,730
But if you're one
of those people

779
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,632
that don't wanna see
the soil in your houseplants,

780
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,400
you can cover it.

781
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,070
All right, aeration is also
a benefit to your houseplants

782
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,404
when you use wool pellets.

783
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:28,242
The houseplants that we have
tend to become root-bound,

784
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,143
so wool pellets give
the much-needed space

785
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,680
that roots need
for growth and aeration.

786
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:37,284
And that moves us into a couple
specific houseplants, Karen.

787
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:40,087
African violets and orchids.

788
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,526
- I love both of those.

789
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,896
African violets, though,
they need bottom watering,

790
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:51,865
but they don't like
to sit in soggy soil.

791
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:56,703
Peat moss takes a long time
to rehydrate once it dries out

792
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,705
when you've forgotten
to water it.

793
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:01,909
And that means a peat-based
potting soil for African violets

794
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:04,811
is really hard
to get fully moistened again

795
00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:06,780
by bottom watering.

796
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,787
If you add wool to the soil
of your African violet pots,

797
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,789
especially near the bottom,

798
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:18,025
it'll give the moisture
when the violet needs it,

799
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:21,595
and it'll stay moister
a lot longer.

800
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,397
The peat versus wool
comparisons

801
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,532
that we've tried
with African violets

802
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,468
showed that the wool increased
the new growth of leaves

803
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:31,305
and reduced the frequency
of water needed.

804
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,141
I usually watered my
African violets with the wool

805
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,210
about every 15 days,

806
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:38,745
and about every six days
for the ones

807
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:41,481
that just had the peat mix in.

808
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:46,420
Orchids also love moisture,
but can't be left too wet

809
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,222
or the roots will rot.

810
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:50,424
Adding about a tablespoon
of wool

811
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,927
into your orchid media will
keep them consistently moist,

812
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:55,696
but still allow some drainage,

813
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,831
and it also gives them
some nutrients

814
00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:59,499
as they break down.

815
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,502
Orchids can be
very temperamental,

816
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,071
dropping blossoms
at the least provocation

817
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,806
or the least amount of stress.

818
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:07,508
I've found that adding wool

819
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,744
helps them handle the stress
without losing their blossoms.

820
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:14,381
I've actually transported
orchids in full bloom

821
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:17,050
an hour and a half
to a show for a weekend

822
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:22,256
and then hauled them back,
and she handled it like a pro.

823
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,496
- All the information
we've given you today

824
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:32,099
has been directed
towards the home gardener.

825
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,868
But the real truth is
that wool answer

826
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:40,207
is the answer for all plants,
all growing situations.

827
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,042
Whether you're a home gardener

828
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:45,979
or a large-scale farmer,
wool is for you.

829
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:48,282
Wool is a natural fertilizer.

830
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:51,218
It's sustainable,
it's renewable.

831
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,553
It sequesters carbon

832
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,855
and helps with any
legacy phosphorus problems

833
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:59,059
since it's virtually, since it
virtually has no phosphorus.

834
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,696
It's moisture retaining
and drought resistant.

835
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:05,299
It improves soil structure
and fertility,

836
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:07,234
and it can replace peat.

837
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:11,538
It's also been approved
for organic growers.

838
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,409
This past year, we had
a large-scale farm operation

839
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:19,046
purchase 1,000 pounds
to try on their brassica fields,

840
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:21,048
and they were pleased
with the results.

841
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,884
Here's what the farm specialist
had to say.

842
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,385
"I liked the product.

843
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:27,020
"It was easy to spread.

844
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:28,355
"We used a spinner spreader

845
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:30,591
"and applied all the Woollets
to the first planting

846
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:34,061
"of brussels sprouts
three weeks after transplanting.

847
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:36,263
"And then came back
10 to 14 days later

848
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,665
"and cultivated
with the Danish tine.

849
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:41,635
I would use the product again."

850
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,807
Research supports using wool
as a fertilizer

851
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:48,609
and a soil amendment.

852
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,878
There's the
University of Vermont study,

853
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:53,146
the Ohio State University study,

854
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:55,849
as well as the <i>Journal</i>
<i>of Ecological Engineering,</i>

855
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,652
and they all
indicate the same thing.

856
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,121
There have also been a number
of published scientific papers

857
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:03,323
in Europe
showing the benefits of wool

858
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,158
on soil fertility

859
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:09,530
compared to traditional
chemical fertilizers.

860
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:12,132
Let's take the Vermont study
first.

861
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,067
The University of Vermont
Extension

862
00:42:14,134 --> 00:42:16,103
Center for
Sustainable Agriculture

863
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,973
found that wool could replace
commercial fertilizers

864
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,042
for organic growers.

865
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:24,278
As you can see from this photo,

866
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:26,513
the right side,
grown with wool pellets,

867
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,949
is much healthier
than the control group,

868
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:33,320
which used the farm's
usual fertilizer protocol.

869
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:36,089
Yields were also ready earlier.

870
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:41,562
Next, the Ohio State University
research indicated,

871
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,530
and I'm quoting,
"With sheep's wool,

872
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:47,434
"you're getting between 9.3%
and 14% nitrogen.

873
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:49,102
"When the researcher
and his team

874
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:52,539
"started testing the impact
of such high nitrogen numbers,

875
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,676
"they found
that with typical fertilizers,

876
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:58,278
"greenhouses could
bring organic tomatoes

877
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:02,482
"from seed to market-ready
in about 76 days,

878
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,987
"but with wool pellets
and their nitrogen punch,

879
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:09,122
"you could bring tomatoes
market-ready

880
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:11,425
in as little as 38 days!"

881
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,229
Wow.

882
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:17,965
In addition,

883
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,003
the Ohio State University
discovered

884
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,572
reduced grow time
for vegetables,

885
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,976
water savings,
softens hard clays,

886
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:32,212
pest control, including aphids,

887
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:34,815
all-natural/organic properties
of wool,

888
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:38,318
and it creates a market
for waste wool.

889
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:44,691
And finally, the <i>Journal</i>
<i>of Ecological Engineering</i> study.

890
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,126
In this research,

891
00:43:46,193 --> 00:43:50,030
the wool was introduced into
soil in two ways in houseplants

892
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:52,900
in the form of a compact layer
at the bottom of the pot,

893
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,668
which is sample A,

894
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:57,671
in the form of
an evenly-incorporated mixture

895
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:00,774
into the soil,
that's sample B,

896
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:04,711
and then the control-group,
sample zero, with no wool.

897
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:07,047
The research focused
on the impact of the wool

898
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:08,715
and method of its deployment

899
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:11,919
on soil humidity
and root growth.

900
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,588
Here are the results.

901
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,757
Group zero,
the soil only,

902
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:19,760
developed fine roots in the
entirety of the root ball,

903
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:23,397
with a few thicker roots
at the bottom.

904
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:26,967
In group A, with wool
just at the bottom of the plant,

905
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:29,436
it developed the same
fine roots in the entirety

906
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:30,771
of the root ball,

907
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:34,875
with a much higher number
of thicker roots at the bottom.

908
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:38,345
In group B, with the wool
throughout the root ball,

909
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:42,316
it developed thick roots
in the entire volume of the pot,

910
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:44,451
long roots
which grew quickly

911
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,486
and attained
considerable length,

912
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,555
and their main function was
to provide the plant

913
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,591
with fixation in the substrate

914
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:54,394
and to transport substances
taken up by the shorter roots.

915
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:56,396
Thus, the structure
of the root system

916
00:44:56,463 --> 00:45:00,300
from research group B proves the
presence of water and nutrients

917
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:04,371
and it's accessed
in the entire volume of soil.

918
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:06,874
Moreover, it was observed
that the outer layer

919
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,810
of the soil in the pots
containing the plants

920
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:13,213
from groups zero and A
behaved similarly

921
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,350
in that they were moist
immediately after watering,

922
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:19,987
but then dried up quickly
in one to two days.

923
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:22,456
The outer layer of soil
in B,

924
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:24,458
the wool throughout
the entire pot,

925
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:30,097
on the other hand, it retained
moisture for two to five days.

926
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:37,437
- You may actually be wondering
why we're doing this,

927
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:39,406
why we started that.

928
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:43,544
The reason,
one of the reasons, my reason,

929
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,078
is that, as a shepherd,

930
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:48,115
I saw thousands and thousands
of pounds of wool

931
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:50,150
being thrown out or burned

932
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:53,654
because there is no longer
a viable market for wool.

933
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,124
In 2023, the Midwest's
main wool buyer

934
00:45:57,191 --> 00:45:59,293
closed its doors,
and they were only paying

935
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,596
a penny to a nickel a pound
for wool.

936
00:46:03,564 --> 00:46:07,601
So what I wanted to do was
find a new market for shepherds,

937
00:46:07,668 --> 00:46:10,003
a new market to get rid
of all of this waste wool

938
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,706
and turn it
into something usable.

939
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,208
I was telling Elaine about it,

940
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,843
and she is more focused
on the aspect

941
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:18,145
of being a good steward
for the Earth

942
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:20,347
and diverting things
out of landfills

943
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:24,785
and making it useful
and more economically friendly.

944
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:27,788
So that's what got us started
on this,

945
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:28,989
and that's why I still have

946
00:46:29,056 --> 00:46:31,658
8,000 pounds of wool
in my garage.

947
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:34,461
It's just the two of us
doing this,

948
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:36,930
and coming here
and trying to educate

949
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:38,565
and let people know
that there is,

950
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,901
there are
alternatives out there.

951
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:42,936
Now, we've told you
all about the benefits.

952
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:46,974
Now let's talk about how you
can add the wool to your soil.

953
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,943
You could find
a local sheep farmer

954
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,913
for whole, raw,
sheared fleeces for mulching.

955
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,017
And if you need one,
I can probably hook you up.

956
00:46:57,084 --> 00:47:00,087
You can buy
raw unshredded wool.

957
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,256
You can find it online,

958
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,124
although it's
less frequent than,

959
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,128
or less available
than the whole fleeces.

960
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:12,165
Remember that you want raw wool
with the lanolin still in it.

961
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:16,570
This is very important
because the lanolin is what

962
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:19,206
does the protections
for slugs and pests

963
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:20,908
and varmint deterrents.

964
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:24,211
Washed wool is
just really pretty.

965
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:28,882
It's good
if you wanna make a sweater.

966
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:35,956
And the easiest way to add wool
to your soil is wool pellets,

967
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:38,258
which we call Woollets.

968
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:41,395
You can find all three
of these forms of wool online

969
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:45,499
at our website, woollets.net,
or you can stop by our booth.

970
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:49,102
We'd be happy to hook you up
or answer questions.

971
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,971
Basically, that was
all the time that we had,

972
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,773
and we wanted to thank you
for letting us

973
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,441
share our passion with you.

974
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:56,410
So thank you so much.

975
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:58,645
