00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,740
- Victor Zadarej:
Thank you for being here.

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,742
My name's Vic Zadarej.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,112
My goal today
is to not only show you

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,216
how simple and easy it is
to become an indoor gardener,

6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,319
but hopefully inspire you
to be able to do this,

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,422
you know, same hobby
that I've been doing for years.

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,458
So, I'm gonna start
with a real quick story.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:28,795
So, my father-in-law,
who was 78 at the time,

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,432
He's 89 now,
so I guess that's 11 years.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,768
He got into indoor gardening

12
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,404
based on some of the things
that we were doing.

13
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,673
And he came to me one time,
and he said,

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,643
"Vic, you've got
a dangerous hobby here.

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,045
"You're gonna get addicted,
and you're gonna wanna do more

16
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,247
and more of this all the time."

17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,583
But then we realized
that's not a bad addiction,

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,552
'cause not only is it fun,

19
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,554
but it allows you
to actually grow things

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,223
that you can eat at home
all year long.

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,393
So, that's sort of what
my story's gonna be.

22
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,697
And I'm hoping to show you, you
know, what we do, how we do it.

23
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,999
I'm originally
from Fort Wayne, Indiana,

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,734
so I grew up in Fort Wayne,

25
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,438
but I went to school
in Boston at MIT.

26
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,541
So, I spent five years
with a bachelor's and master's

27
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,743
in engineering there.

28
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,247
And I currently work
in the electronics industry.

29
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,617
I work for a company
called Molex

30
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,719
in Lisle, Illinois.

31
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,588
Most of you have
probably heard of Naperville,

32
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,324
but Lisle is right next to it.

33
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:34,328
And I became an indoor gardener
roughly 13 years ago,

34
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,431
so we'll talk a little bit
about indoor gardening

35
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,267
and how I came about it
here shortly.

36
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,803
So, the other thing
I wanted to bring up is

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,707
there's a book called <i>Grow</i>
<i>Lettuce in Your Living Room,</i>

38
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,709
and I co-authored it
with a fellow

39
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,011
by the name of Dan Chiras.

40
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,447
I met Dan probably
about seven, eight years ago

41
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,949
at a Mother Earth News event,

42
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,485
and he was walking by our booth,
and he said,

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,988
"Vic, you know,
I see you are, you know,

44
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,155
"you have these grow lights.

45
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,790
"And I built
these Chinese greenhouses

46
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,559
"that don't require energy.

47
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,327
"But I've been looking
for grow lights,

48
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,630
and the ones I've been trying
don't work."

49
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,131
So, we gave him some lights,

50
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,567
and I knew him from, you know,
the books that he'd written.

51
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,802
He's written, like,
43 other books.

52
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,739
So, he wrote a book
on passive solar homes,

53
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,910
which I live in a
passive solar home as well.

54
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,979
And so we knew each other
just through that world.

55
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,449
And he started using
the technology,

56
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,252
well, method of growing
that we use.

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,521
And he called me, like,
six months later, and he says,

58
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,356
"Your lights are incredible."

59
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,358
So, he was able to grow
all sorts of things,

60
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,260
which he could
never do with the lights

61
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,729
that he was buying
at big box stores

62
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,132
or various online sites.

63
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:51,104
So, we became close friends, and
then a few years later, he said,

64
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,907
"Let's write a book,"
so that's what this book is.

65
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,876
So, it's called <i>Grow Lettuce</i>
<i>in Your Living Room.</i>

66
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,278
It's available on Amazon.

67
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,749
And so it's a great source
if you want details on things

68
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:07,087
that we cannot cover here
within the next hour.

69
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,522
But I also wanted to say

70
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,258
that if you get on
to our YouTube channel,

71
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,627
our Happy Leaf YouTube channel,

72
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,231
you'll find probably
about 85 videos of us

73
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,199
showing you how to grow indoors.

74
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,402
So, there's a lot of great
information on the website.

75
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,738
So, the first question
everybody asks is

76
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,206
what can you grow indoors?

77
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,542
So, the first thing
I always say is

78
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,044
start with leafy greens, herbs.

79
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,347
Those are really easy to do.

80
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,616
Then microgreens are
another thing

81
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,351
if you want to grow quickly.

82
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,752
They're very nutritious.

83
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,153
There's a,
we'll talk a lot more

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,923
about microgreens here shortly.

85
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,125
And then if you want to take it
to another level,

86
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,227
things like kale, spinach,

87
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:52,466
bok choy, eggplant, peppers,
beets, carrots, tomatoes,

88
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,802
all of those things
can actually be grown indoors,

89
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,137
and they can be done quickly.

90
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:01,975
In fact, I had a customer
who I met here last year

91
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,577
and he bought a few lights,

92
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,846
and he said, you know,
he wanted to grow tomatoes,

93
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,948
and I said,
"Here, take these tomatoes."

94
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,350
In fact,
I gave two tomato plants away,

95
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,419
and both those customers
came back,

96
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,255
and they said,
those tomatoes are still alive

97
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,624
and they're growing
and producing.

98
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,493
And it's sort of exciting.

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,695
I think that's the fun
that I have at this event.

100
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,932
Every year, I come back, and
I listen to all these customers

101
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,834
that I've been working with,

102
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,770
and they either want to expand
their indoor gardens

103
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:33,140
or they tell me about the
successes that they've had.

104
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,843
So, that makes it
really exciting.

105
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,512
So, why grow your
own food indoors?

106
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,948
I'm not gonna read through
this entire list.

107
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,317
You're welcome to sort of glance
at it,

108
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,285
but for many people,

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,457
they want to be able to grow
pesticide and herbicide free.

110
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,393
They want to grow it
exactly what they want.

111
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,596
Something may not be
what they're looking for

112
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,098
in a grocery store,
so they want to grow it.

113
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,501
They can grow it locally,
which is their basement

114
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,437
or their closet
or their kitchen.

115
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,672
And, you know, during COVID,

116
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,075
you know, a lot of shelves
were empty.

117
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,378
And so now you can grow
your own food all year long.

118
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,814
You don't worry
about <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i>

119
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,750
with all the recalls
that we're also hearing.

120
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,918
And the other thing

121
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,286
that's becoming more
and more important,

122
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,655
and I'll have a little story
on this,

123
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,291
is it's 90% less expensive.

124
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,828
You literally can grow
a nice big head of lettuce

125
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,396
for about a quarter,

126
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:33,333
whereas the same thing
in the store, may be $3 or $4.

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,336
So, that is becoming more
and more important.

128
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,771
And there's a lot of questions

129
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,340
about food security
that we'll talk about,

130
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,209
and there's a really interesting
story, actually,

131
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,911
I'll bring up here shortly.

132
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,946
And the last part of it is
it's fun.

133
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,616
You know, you really,
it's amazing to watch a seed

134
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,018
turn into a big head of lettuce

135
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,354
in a matter
of three to four weeks.

136
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,223
So, what can you grow?

137
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,192
So, we talked
a little bit earlier,

138
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,328
but microgreens is a really,
really good way to start.

139
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,997
There's lots of
different kinds of microgreens.

140
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,200
They're very healthy,
they're very nutritious.

141
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,801
And, you know,

142
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,237
you've probably heard a lot
about microgreens.

143
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,875
And I think that's a way
to quickly get into a hobby

144
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,378
that is very rewarding.

145
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,415
But leafy greens, anything
that's related to herbs,

146
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,584
to lettuces, are something

147
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,520
that you can also
very quickly grow.

148
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,355
Tomatoes, you know,
most people say,

149
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,058
"Well, how are you gonna grow
tomatoes indoors?"

150
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,027
And the answer is it's actually
pretty easy, as long as you have

151
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,530
the right varieties of tomatoes
and the right methods

152
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,265
and the right lighting
for tomatoes.

153
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:41,268
So, there's a tomato variety

154
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,837
from a company
here in Wisconsin.

155
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,508
Most of you have
probably heard of Jung Seeds.

156
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,879
But Jung also has a brand
called Totally Tomatoes.

157
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:56,083
And I tested a lot
of their tomato varieties,

158
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,419
and I've probably grown
30 different varieties.

159
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:03,524
And I'd say there's three types
of plants that are really good.

160
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,427
And the one is called
Little Red Robin.

161
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,531
And I was growing that,
it was growing really well,

162
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,501
and I was talking
to Brian Isaacs at Jung,

163
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,603
and Brian said, "I'm not
supposed to tell you this,

164
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,041
"but that's the variety
that we grow or work with Purdue

165
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,977
for growing on the International
Space Station."

166
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,346
So, now it's public knowledge.

167
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,483
But basically,
that variety produces a lot,

168
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,251
and that's the one that grows,
you know,

169
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,254
for two or three years already,
some people are using it,

170
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,790
and it not only grows a lot,

171
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,260
but it's also very,
tastes great,

172
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,329
and it's a compact plant.

173
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,965
So, it's really no more
than about two feet in diameter

174
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,900
and maybe
a foot and a half tall.

175
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,303
So, it's a great plant
to grow indoors.

176
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,505
So, there's a few others
that are like that,

177
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,240
but that's one
that really is good.

178
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:57,945
So, things like cucumbers can be
grown, beets, radishes, carrots,

179
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,780
all of those types
of root plants

180
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:03,750
can also be grown indoors
all year long.

181
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,555
So, I guess these are just some
comments related to the book.

182
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:12,459
So, basically, the book is based
on doing passive hydroponics.

183
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,229
So, there's no pumps,
there's no motors.

184
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,665
There's a person
by the name of Bernie Kratky,

185
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,467
Dr. Bernie Kratky,

186
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,269
who we'll talk about here
in a few minutes.

187
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,239
He developed a method
of indoor gardening

188
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,308
that is very basic
and is simple to use,

189
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,479
so any of us can do it,
and I can promise you that.

190
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,548
And so what we'll do is

191
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,851
we'll talk about four different
methods in the book.

192
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,221
Today, we'll actually talk about
three of those four.

193
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,856
Where do you get
the materials?

194
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,224
What types of costs

195
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,294
do you have to, you know,
incur to get started?

196
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:52,132
So, Dan's expertise was being
an author on sustainable living.

197
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,835
And then mine was
really developing the lighting

198
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,336
and also the indoor gardening.

199
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,438
And we collaborated
to create the book.

200
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,074
And there's a lot
of great information in it.

201
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,011
So, I think I can get
you started in this discussion.

202
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,245
But I think, ultimately,

203
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,347
if you really want
a deep dive into it,

204
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:11,652
the book or the YouTube videos
are a great way to go.

205
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,754
So, my indoor gardening story.

206
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,192
So, I've been an outdoor
gardener for 35, 40 years now,

207
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,760
and I, you know,
have raised beds,

208
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,864
and I grow all sorts of things
outside in the summers.

209
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:27,734
But when the summer ends
and you get fall,

210
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,136
you gotta put everything away.

211
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,637
You've gotta can it,

212
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,639
you've gotta put it, you know,
in the basement

213
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,409
or wherever
you're storing your potatoes,

214
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,811
and you wanna keep going.

215
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,615
So, about 12, 13 years ago,

216
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:46,220
again, working for my company
called Molex that I work for,

217
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:50,090
we were asked to develop a
horticultural, or a grow light.

218
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,258
So, we did that.

219
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,492
We designed one.

220
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,294
It was this little
magnetic puck that, you know,

221
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,230
you could snap on anywhere,

222
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,131
and it was really
pretty incredible.

223
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,133
I was actually able to use it
in growing

224
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,402
all sorts of things indoors.

225
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,606
And customers, well,
I shouldn't say customers,

226
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,341
friends and relatives
would ask me,

227
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,443
"Well, where do you
get those lights?"

228
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,777
And I would tell 'em,

229
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,213
"Well, Molex will sell you
10,000 of 'em,

230
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,251
but if you want to buy five of
'em, there's no place to go."

231
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:21,388
So, my wife and I
started Happy Leaf as a way

232
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:25,025
to basically sell those types
of lights to people

233
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,561
who wanted to grow indoors.

234
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,630
And then six months later,
Molex says,

235
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,797
"Well, that's a niche market.

236
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,733
We're not gonna make
those anymore."

237
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,802
So, I said, "Uh-oh, we either
have to forget the company,

238
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,237
or we design our own."

239
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,106
So, now we're actually
designing our own.

240
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:42,543
We're building our
10th generation of lights.

241
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,378
Every year, they become
more efficient,

242
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:48,115
they look better,
they're less expensive to make.

243
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,885
I work with professors
from Purdue, primarily,

244
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,054
and we're doing research
with them

245
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,889
on all sorts of unique ways

246
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,626
of pulsing lights, for instance,
to reduce energy use,

247
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:03,897
but primarily on finding
the spectrums of light

248
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,366
that really give you
the phenomenal plant growth

249
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,469
that allows you
to grow quickly indoors

250
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,639
and pretty much anything
you want to grow.

251
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,809
We do manufacture our lights
in the United States.

252
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,912
In fact, about 100 miles south
of here is Oregon, Illinois,

253
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,547
which is where I live.

254
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,649
And we manufacture it
right there.

255
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,085
So, unlike most of the others
out there, it's,

256
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,154
they're not made in China.

257
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,791
This is Bernie Kratky,
so this is his picture

258
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,527
when he was in the,
at the University of Hawaii.

259
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:37,497
And a lot of the things
that Bernie came up with,

260
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,666
I think are ingenious.

261
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,436
And the reason I say that is
that they were really

262
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:46,340
a simple way to be able to grow
without pumps and motors.

263
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,775
So, most of us
have heard of hydroponics.

264
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,412
You have to have aerators,
you have constant moving pumps.

265
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,481
I stayed away from that
like a plague

266
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,917
because it was just too complex.

267
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:00,521
So, what Bernie did is
he realized,

268
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,155
what he did is he realized

269
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,926
that the plants will absorb
water and nutrients

270
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,128
while in a container like this,

271
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,998
and then effectively,
the water level will drop.

272
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,433
But what he said,
or what he realized

273
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,402
is that when you add water back,

274
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,437
you cannot fill it
all the way up

275
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,908
because it's not gonna get
its oxygen for respiration

276
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,410
if you do that,
so it'll kill the plant.

277
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,813
So, basically when you fill
the jar up with water,

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,117
you fill it up only
to the bottom of the net pot.

279
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,286
And that was the magic
that he realized

280
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,254
that plants will actually grow

281
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:39,359
without all of that exotic
technology that's required

282
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,094
to make it grow.

283
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,999
So, when he was doing it
in Hawaii, he didn't need light

284
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,769
'cause they had all the light
in the world in Hawaii.

285
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,072
And basically,
I work with Bernie,

286
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,475
and I actually talk to him
about once a month now,

287
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,579
and he teaches me a lot
about nutrients

288
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,081
and all the details of plants,

289
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,317
but I teach him
about lighting and LEDs.

290
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:07,187
So, he's using our lights
to actually do that type of,

291
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,889
He's still continuing
to do research.

292
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,792
He's 80 years old, so it's
pretty amazing fellow.

293
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,561
I really have enjoyed
that relationship.

294
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,563
So, "I'm not a gardener.

295
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,731
Can I really do this?"

296
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,300
And that's a question
that I get a lot of.

297
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:24,838
Basically, it's so easy
that it's almost funny.

298
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,774
So, no experience needed.

299
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,243
We guarantee it.

300
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,812
There's a slight learning curve
just as far as knowing

301
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,515
the steps associated
with indoor gardening,

302
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,017
but it's actually,
I would say it's much simpler

303
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,654
than growing outdoors
in the summers.

304
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,523
So, in the book,

305
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,259
we'll go, you know,
through the detailed process.

306
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,895
But even today, we're gonna
actually go through the process

307
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,097
of how do you actually plant
and grow.

308
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,966
So, here's the three methods.

309
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,937
Kratky jars, which is what I
just lifted and showed you here,

310
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,708
is one way to grow things
like leafy greens, herbs.

311
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,310
And if you wanna grow
microgreens,

312
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:06,747
there's literally a tray
that you can plant,

313
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,284
and a matter of 8 to 10 days,
you have mature microgreens

314
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,453
that you could be eating
in the comfort of your home.

315
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,723
And then what we call
self-watering pots.

316
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,525
So, those would be used,

317
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,961
they typically have coconut coir
and vermiculite in 'em,

318
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,231
but if you wanna grow
tomatoes, cucumbers, beets,

319
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,400
carrots, radishes,
root plants,

320
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,168
that's when you would use
that method.

321
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,138
Still passive, there's still
no pumps or motors,

322
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,173
but it's a slightly
different media

323
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,309
for basically growing.

324
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,212
So, those are gonna be
the three different methods

325
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,747
that we're gonna talk about
here in a few minutes.

326
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,016
So, Bernie, this is
actually a picture of Bernie

327
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,520
when he came to visit me
with his sister and brother

328
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,789
about a year and a half ago.

329
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:52,326
So, this was a little,
his comments on,

330
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,062
after he read our book,
we included it.

331
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,397
So, he said,
"I'm absolutely delighted

332
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,565
"that some home growers

333
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,168
"are using these simple
hydroponic methods,

334
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,403
"along with LED lighting
that allows you

335
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,707
to basically become an
indoor gardener all year long."

336
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:10,744
So, if you ever need
to talk to Bernie, let me know

337
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:11,945
and I could probably arrange it.

338
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:16,149
So, but he's sort of my hero
in this industry.

339
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,354
He developed the method when
he was on sabbatical in Taiwan,

340
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,423
working with a professor
from Japan.

341
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,326
And if you go on YouTube
and type in "the Kratky method,"

342
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,829
you'll find hundreds
and hundreds of YouTube videos

343
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,698
regarding the Kratky method.

344
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,102
So, what can I grow
in Kratky jars?

345
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,838
So, we're sort of gonna talk
about the individual steps now.

346
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:41,341
So, things like lettuces,
dill, herbs,

347
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,378
anything that is basically
leafy greens

348
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,481
is something that grows
really, really well.

349
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:51,185
And then some of the other
things like kale, spinach,

350
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,388
that are leafy greens, you will
actually grow those in a mixture

351
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,124
of the coconut coir
and vermiculite.

352
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:00,561
So, one of the methods
that we advocate

353
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,964
is basically growing
on a baker's rack.

354
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,599
So, this is a baker's rack.

355
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,402
And what we do is we adjust
the height of the baker's rack.

356
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,471
So, you typically start
near the top of the rack.

357
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,507
And then
as the plants get bigger,

358
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,809
you can just move the plants
down.

359
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,612
So, if you wanted to feed
a family of four

360
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,247
with all the greens
that you wanted,

361
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,583
you would literally do it
on a baker's rack.

362
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,918
And that is your greenhouse.

363
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,388
Greenhouses in some ways
have become obsolete

364
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,225
because you have to heat 'em,
they're expensive to build,

365
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,693
you need the space.

366
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,029
Why not, for, you know,
less than $1,000,

367
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,065
more like $600 or $700,

368
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:42,269
you can have a baker's rack
in the basement of your home

369
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,105
or anywhere else in your home
where you have the space,

370
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,741
and you can literally grow
everything you want.

371
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:50,077
And that's really
the main story

372
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,113
that I'd like
to get across today.

373
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:59,319
So, some of the advantages
of growing in one-quart jars,

374
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:02,189
so, you saw
that one quart jar I had here,

375
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:05,359
is basically the cost
of the jar, the net pot,

376
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,761
and everything is, like, $3.

377
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,364
Everything is reusable,
so you could literally wash it,

378
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,933
throw it in a dishwasher,
sterilize it, and reuse it

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,370
so there's really nothing
to throw out.

380
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,772
You typically would put,
you know,

381
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,707
you'll see that the roots
actually,

382
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,243
in this case,
look nice and clean.

383
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,445
What I did is I had
a dark sock over it,

384
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,616
and the dark sock prevents
the light from getting in it

385
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,085
so you don't get algae growth.

386
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,320
So, that's sort of important.

387
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,255
But you can go
to the local dollar store

388
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,025
and buy a dozen socks
for about $10,

389
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,962
and you have all the socks
that you'll need for forever.

390
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,964
And having a sock over it

391
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,766
allows you to quickly check
the water level.

392
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,936
So, if the water levels get low,
you just lift up the,

393
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,605
or lift, lower the sock
to see that,

394
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,374
and then you fill up with water
and then you keep going.

395
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,077
And the other thing
that is really neat about this

396
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,012
is that it's amazing.

397
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,682
People are amazed
when they come and see this,

398
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,418
that you can put a seed
in a canning jar,

399
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,954
and in a matter
of three to four weeks,

400
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,555
you're eating your lettuce.

401
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,825
So, that's sort of
a really, really neat way

402
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,894
of being able to grow.

403
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,563
So, nutrient options.

404
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,201
There are literally dozens
of nutrients that you can use.

405
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,438
This is actually a list
of ones that we like.

406
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:27,908
I believe the one that
we have suggest to start with

407
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,409
is the one called MaxiGro,

408
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:33,146
which is the green bag
on the upper left.

409
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,984
But the one that Bernie actually
recently recommended to me

410
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,986
is the one called SUPERthrive.

411
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,122
And the reason that one is nice
is that it's liquid

412
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,825
and it's very easy to get
dissolved into your water.

413
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,594
So, you know, all of 'em
have their pluses and minuses.

414
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,130
And if you want
a fully organic one,

415
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,132
the one on the left here,
the Pure Blend Pro,

416
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,736
is an organic version as well,
so there's a lot of options.

417
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,039
I highly recommend you try
the ones that you like the most

418
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:02,009
and see what works best for you.

419
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,779
So, what else
do you need to do this?

420
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:09,783
So, one of the things
that you need is a net pot,

421
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,619
which is basically the
little pot that's inside of here

422
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,621
that holds the clay pellets.

423
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,790
You need the hydroponic
clay pellets,

424
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,825
which is basically fired clay,

425
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,962
and that's used to hold
the seed initially.

426
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,798
After they germinate,
the seeds will drop,

427
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,168
and effectively, the roots will
be held by those clay pellets.

428
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,571
And then the roots
will basically drop down,

429
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:35,275
and you've got,
those are effectively your soil.

430
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:40,047
So, the process to actually
do the planting is this.

431
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:44,952
So, what you do is you start
with a large-mouth canning jar

432
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,422
and you fill it with water
right up to that lip

433
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,892
that's on top of that
canning jar.

434
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:55,629
And then you take your
net pot with the clay pellets,

435
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,030
you know, you sort of fill it

436
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,700
within maybe a quarter
of an inch of the top,

437
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:03,971
and then you put that into the
jar and screw the lid on.

438
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,773
When you do that,
the water level will come

439
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,709
basically to the top
of those pellets.

440
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,244
They're gonna be wet.

441
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,713
Now you take five or six seeds

442
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,482
and drop 'em
onto those wet clay pellets.

443
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,352
So, now they're sticking
to those clay pellets.

444
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:22,489
And now you take
your black sock, cover it.

445
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,224
And the purpose of that,
obviously,

446
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,361
is to prevent algae growth
on the inside.

447
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,096
So, that's it.

448
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,332
That's the whole process
of actually planting.

449
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,737
And now I actually did 12 jars,
and I sort of timed myself

450
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:40,140
'cause I'm doing some
experiments at, in our office,

451
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,243
and I think I did 12 jars
in about 15 minutes.

452
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,647
So, I do it because I take
a gallon container of water,

453
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,649
fill four jars up,
and just do it.

454
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,084
And it's just,
it's very quick and simple.

455
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:55,589
And so now you have, basically
your garden is planted,

456
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,592
and now you can leave it
under the light.

457
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,095
You, typically, I would turn
a light on for 16 to 18 hours,

458
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,631
but you can leave it
under the light.

459
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:08,101
Go on vacation, I say, to
Florida for three to four weeks,

460
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,271
and when you come back,
you're ready to eat.

461
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,707
So, this is sort of
what it looks like

462
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,275
when you grow after one week.

463
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,177
The light, basically,
not the light,

464
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:21,415
but the plants will be maybe
a half an inch to an inch tall.

465
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,583
The second week, you know,

466
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,618
they've gotten
a little bit bigger.

467
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:25,786
Third week, and somewhere

468
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,187
between the third
and fourth week

469
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:31,191
for this particular lettuce, you
can literally start eating it.

470
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,961
You can see what
the roots look like,

471
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,129
and that's pretty much
what these look like

472
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,931
that I had up here.

473
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,167
It looks like a little
Santa Claus beard.

474
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,603
And so what happens
is those roots just drop

475
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,137
and follow the water level.

476
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:47,140
So, that's really one of the
things that Bernie realized

477
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:48,976
is that the plants
will effectively

478
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:54,314
follow the water level down and
absorb nutrients and the water.

479
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,917
And again, the comment
that I have on the bottom,

480
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:01,188
"Never add water
above the bottom of the net pot

481
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:02,489
or you will kill the plant."

482
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:05,859
So, that's the reason
passive hydroponics works,

483
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,662
because otherwise
you're gonna have aerators

484
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,797
and moving air and bubbles.

485
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:13,333
And that's something that I've
always wanted to stay away from

486
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,103
because of the complexity
associated with it.

487
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,574
So, this is really a very,
very simple way to do that.

488
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,309
So, microgreens.

489
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:25,345
Many of you have
probably heard of microgreens.

490
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:29,816
Basically, they're immature
plants that use standard seeds.

491
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:32,186
You know, you can have
broccoli microgreens.

492
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:36,623
You can have kale microgreens,
you can have radish microgreens.

493
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,159
And they're typically considered
to be

494
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:42,496
five to ten times more
nutritious, higher energy,

495
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:45,232
or higher nutrient density.

496
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:49,069
They're very easy to grow,
there's lots of varieties.

497
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,672
There's literally 50 varieties.

498
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:54,441
A company called Johnny's Seeds
in Maine

499
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,276
is a really, really good source.

500
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:58,545
Another one is called
True Leaf Seeds,

501
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:02,482
which we've recently
started buying from.

502
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,819
They grow very quickly,
so literally 8 to 12 days,

503
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,722
you're often starting
to eat 'em.

504
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,891
They can be grown
in very small spaces.

505
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,694
I mean, we literally
are growing microgreens

506
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,629
with a little light that is,

507
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,064
actually, this is
what it looks like.

508
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,601
It's a five-watt light,
but yet it puts out enough light

509
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,971
to grow an entire tray
of microgreens.

510
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,706
The other thing
about microgreens,

511
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,708
I don't know how many of you
have bought 'em,

512
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,510
but they're very expensive
to buy.

513
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,712
A tray is like $20, $25.

514
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:36,149
It costs about $1.50 to grow
that same tray of microgreens,

515
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:39,520
and that includes electricity,
seeds, and nutrients.

516
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,689
And so if you enjoy
eating greens in general,

517
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,992
that's a great way to go.

518
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,762
Very quick to plant
and to clean up

519
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,632
because we don't use
dirt or soils or anything.

520
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:53,934
You literally are using
nutrient water

521
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,236
just like we do this process.

522
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:59,072
So, the cleaning-up process
is a few minutes,

523
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:02,176
and then you can replant
and keep going again.

524
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,677
They taste great.

525
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:06,847
And for those of you
that are entrepreneurs,

526
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,749
it's a great business
opportunity,

527
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,585
because again, if it's something
you could sell for $20

528
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,254
and it cost you $1.50 to grow,
I don't know of anything

529
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:17,057
that has margins like that
anywhere else,

530
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,793
so it's a great opportunity.

531
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:23,063
So, what do you need
to grow microgreens?

532
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,698
So, this is a microgreen tray.

533
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,300
You can actually get on Amazon

534
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,836
and type in the word
"microgreen tray."

535
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,638
And you will find varieties
of 'em that exist.

536
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,841
The only thing I'd make sure
you do

537
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,976
is look to make sure
that they have a cover.

538
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:38,278
There are some that you can buy
that, without the cover,

539
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,915
but the cover is absolutely
critical for germination.

540
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,451
Again, one of the nutrients
that we'd recommend,

541
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:48,388
although recently the one
that Bernie recommended,

542
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:51,892
the SUPERthrive,
is one that's also a great one.

543
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,794
You need a paper towel,

544
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:56,396
and that paper towel,
basically, is something

545
00:24:56,463 --> 00:25:00,901
that you lie down on the surface
so the seeds don't fall through.

546
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:05,539
We talked about Johnny's Seeds,
a great source for seeds.

547
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:07,541
True Leaf Seeds
is another one.

548
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:10,911
If you get on Johnny's website,
you will literally find

549
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:12,779
50 different types
of microgreens.

550
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,882
They'll tell you
how fast they grow,

551
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:17,551
and they're very inexpensive.

552
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,553
If you were to compare that
to the way

553
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,623
that you buy seeds
in these packets for $3 or $4,

554
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,658
they're exactly the same seed.

555
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:28,695
But here for about $15, you
can get a whole pound of 'em.

556
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:30,197
So, the only difference is

557
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:33,867
that microgreen seeds may be
last year's version,

558
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:36,637
and they may not germinate
quite as well.

559
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,805
But the truth is,
you could use those seeds

560
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,609
to grow plants to full maturity
if you wanted to.

561
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,511
So, how do you plant
microgreens?

562
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:46,013
So, you start with a tray.

563
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,848
Make sure you lie it
on a flat surface

564
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,683
so that everything is flat.

565
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,188
Fill it with water until it gets
to the top of that white tray.

566
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:57,524
You place the paper towel
on top of it.

567
00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:01,261
And then basically, so, now
you've got a wet paper towel

568
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:04,298
and now you sprinkle the seeds,
and they typically say

569
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:06,600
spread 'em about
one seed distance

570
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,770
from the other seed,
so you're putting a lot of 'em,

571
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:12,105
and there's probably
10,000 seeds on there.

572
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,675
Cover the tray,
put it under the light,

573
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,145
and then basically,
within a day or two,

574
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:21,081
you'll start seeing
that the seeds start cracking.

575
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,283
And usually three to four days,

576
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,220
you've taken the cover off,
and now they're growing.

577
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:28,922
You may see these tiny
little white things coming out,

578
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:31,558
and people say, "Well,
something's not looking right."

579
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,827
But those are actually
the beginnings of the roots.

580
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:36,430
And the roots will
literally drop down

581
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:38,365
and go through the paper,

582
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,400
and then you will
literally see 'em

583
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,469
on the back side of that tray.

584
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:44,338
And so you're really
growing very much

585
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,907
like the canning jar approach.

586
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:50,277
So, these are two different
images of microgreens,

587
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,679
kale's on the left,
radishes on the right.

588
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:54,781
And this is about
8 to 10 days.

589
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,417
So, when you're ready
to harvest them,

590
00:26:57,484 --> 00:27:00,220
you literally just lift 'em up,
give 'em a haircut,

591
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,190
and then you can just leave
the ones that you haven't eaten

592
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:06,193
and come back a day later
and have another salad

593
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,061
or put 'em
into whatever you want.

594
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,865
So, they're really,
really quick and easy to grow.

595
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:13,400
So, that's microgreens.

596
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:16,837
So, now we're gonna talk about
how do you grow root plants,

597
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,906
tomatoes, peppers,
spinach, kale,

598
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,308
and that you're gonna grow
in a container

599
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,977
that I call
a self-watering container.

600
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:27,014
The one on the left is
from a company called Hydrofarm,

601
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,815
called the tomato trellis.

602
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:29,983
The one on the right

603
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,519
is a company called Bloem
in Michigan.

604
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:34,087
So, they're manufactured
in Michigan.

605
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,023
It's called their
Lucca container.

606
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,892
And I usually use those
for growing things

607
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,694
like cucumbers and tomatoes.

608
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:43,830
That's a perfect type
of container for that.

609
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,732
And the media that you use

610
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,837
is typically a mixture
of coconut coir and vermiculite.

611
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:53,307
So, I usually use
about 70% coco coir

612
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:56,210
and 30% vermiculite or perlite.

613
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:59,179
So, you can sort of
interchange those as well.

614
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:03,116
And that works really well
for growing root plants

615
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:08,388
and, again, tomatoes, cucumbers,
and plants like that.

616
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:12,793
So, spinach, spinach is one
of the leafy greens

617
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,997
that does not grow well
in containers like this

618
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:19,733
because it doesn't germinate
very well.

619
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,537
So, basically we suggest
you grow your spinach

620
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:25,806
and some things like,

621
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,076
cilantro is another one
that is hard to germinate.

622
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,078
We suggest you do that
in a mixture

623
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,880
of the coconut coir
and vermiculite.

624
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:35,115
So, this is a container
of spinach.

625
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:37,284
And this was my first harvest.

626
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,387
So, spinach will grow,
this is a spinach variety

627
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,789
called Corvair
that I really like.

628
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,893
And nice, big leaves,
it tastes incredibly good.

629
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,962
So, we'll typically cut
the big leaves first.

630
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,465
And then there's a lot of other
little leaves underneath

631
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:54,501
that are starting
to get their light to 'em.

632
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,671
And so you'll typically get
two to three cuttings,

633
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,406
not because it's growing back,

634
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,175
but the leaves
that are underneath it

635
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,043
didn't get exposed
to the light,

636
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,680
so now you're able to
effectively get them to grow.

637
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,183
And then you can do
another cutting from them.

638
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:12,819
So, spinach
is an incredibly healthy,

639
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:17,191
quick-growing, you know, plant
that you can grow this way.

640
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,226
So, you saw this image earlier,

641
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:21,461
but basically
I wanted to bring it back again.

642
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:23,830
So, again, you can grow beets
this way,

643
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:27,701
you can grow carrots this way,
turnips, radishes.

644
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,804
So, basically, root plants
grow really well

645
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,873
in this type of media.

646
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,311
Here's peppers,
this is a poblano pepper.

647
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:39,713
I've grown dozens
of different kinds of peppers.

648
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,548
So, those of you
that like peppers,

649
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,383
peppers take a while to grow.

650
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,053
It requires a little more heat
or warmth

651
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,821
to get 'em to grow well.

652
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:49,189
And then cucumbers.

653
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:51,892
This is a variety
called Kosara.

654
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,961
And one of the things
about cucumbers

655
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:57,364
is you've gotta use what's
called parthenocarpic cucumbers,

656
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,733
which are ones
that basically are all female.

657
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,602
They don't require pollination.

658
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:04,037
And there's also
quite a few of those.

659
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:07,174
And again, Jung Seeds
and Totally Tomatoes

660
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:12,279
has a variety of parthenocarpic
cucumbers that you can use.

661
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,848
Tomatoes,
so we talked a little bit

662
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:18,519
about tomato growing earlier,
and Little Red Robin,

663
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:21,788
or sometimes they call it
Little Birdy Red Robin,

664
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:24,091
from Totally Tomatoes
is a really good choice,

665
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:27,261
and that, their location is
literally an hour from here.

666
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,196
They're not very far,
Jung Seeds.

667
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:30,597
And I think they have stores,

668
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:32,399
retail stores
all over the state.

669
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,369
I don't know if they carry this
variety in their retail stores,

670
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:38,005
but you can definitely order it
online.

671
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,974
Tiny Tim is another tomato
variety that's a great one,

672
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:44,311
but not from, unfortunately,
not from Totally Tomatoes

673
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,246
'cause it's a completely
different seed.

674
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:47,848
I don't understand why,

675
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:51,251
but RDR Seeds is one
that I found on Amazon,

676
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:52,419
and it works great.

677
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:54,321
I'm actually right now
in the middle of testing

678
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:58,192
about three or four other
varieties of Tiny Tim as well.

679
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:00,928
Sweet n Neat
is also from Totally Tomatoes,

680
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:03,697
but I noticed
that they don't always carry it.

681
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:05,432
So, what you see there
on the bottom

682
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:08,635
is a bowl of cucumber
tomato salad

683
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,804
that I actually, I love that.

684
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,140
It's, I grew up
with cucumber tomato salad.

685
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,742
So, I grew the dill,
I grow the cucumbers,

686
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,212
and I grew the tomatoes,
so those are sort of,

687
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:21,682
I'm proud of being able to grow
all those things indoors.

688
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:25,219
So, this is an image
of a baker's rack.

689
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,790
And there's a little bit
of a backstory on this one.

690
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:33,594
So, we live in what's called
Ogle County, Illinois.

691
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,897
Ogle County applied
for a CDC grant

692
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,632
a couple of years ago.

693
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:40,434
A year and a half ago,
they got it,

694
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:43,704
and it's a $500,000-a-year grant
for three years

695
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,976
for developing methods
to reduce food security issues.

696
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,211
So, their whole objective
is to figure out

697
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,114
how to grow food,
and not only grow food,

698
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:58,118
but also provide food to people
who need it.

699
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,953
But one of the things
they wanna do

700
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,656
is to educate people on
how to grow their own food

701
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:04,458
and provide it initially
to them.

702
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,859
So, next weekend, actually,

703
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:09,696
I'm gonna be speaking at the
Ogle County Health Department

704
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:12,466
and teaching people
how to grow their own food.

705
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,802
So, this is actually
in their building.

706
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,371
The first year, they went out

707
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,474
and bought
these Chinese tower gardens,

708
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,009
and they were complete garbage.

709
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,710
They just literally,
the lights were terrible.

710
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,346
There was water being shot
everywhere.

711
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:30,217
And so what happened is
they threw those out,

712
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,719
and they started doing
a web search,

713
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,355
and they saw there's
a company in Oregon, Illinois,

714
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:37,591
that teaches people
how to grow food,

715
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:41,228
and they make their own lights,
and let's see what they do.

716
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,597
So, they came knocking
on our door, and they said,

717
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:45,399
"We're here
from the Health Department."

718
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,534
And you can imagine
what we thought,

719
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,571
because we're growing lettuce
and herbs and tomatoes in there

720
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,606
and said, "Uh-oh,
we're in trouble."

721
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:53,974
So, they said, "No, we're here

722
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,410
to have you teach us
how to do this."

723
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:00,414
So, we started setting up
these areas, you know,

724
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,350
these shelves,
these baker's racks

725
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,119
all over the county,
so we've got 'em in the YMCAs,

726
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:08,055
we've got 'em
in the churches,

727
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,857
we've got 'em in a couple
of the different

728
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,558
health department locations.

729
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,328
So, this is what it looked like
when we set it up.

730
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:17,064
Joyce sent me a picture
three weeks later,

731
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,699
which is the one on the right,

732
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:20,767
and they said,
"Vic, take a look at this."

733
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,703
So, that's what
that shelf looked like,

734
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:25,105
which was really the one,
the shelf there,

735
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,573
the second one down.

736
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,308
But they're growing a lot
of microgreens.

737
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,977
So, that's what the trays are.

738
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:32,179
And then they had one shelf
with the lettuce on it.

739
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,548
So, that is an
interesting story.

740
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,150
The fact that we were a mile
and a half away from them,

741
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,852
they're the only county
that got the funding,

742
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:40,254
and we're, as far as I know,

743
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,122
we're the only company
in the country

744
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:45,092
that's teaching people
how to do this method,

745
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:48,595
along with developing the lights
that really enable it.

746
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:50,964
So, that was
an interesting story, I thought.

747
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:54,668
So, all three methods
require light.

748
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,470
A lot of people
will come up to me

749
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,572
and say, "Well,
I have an LED shop light.

750
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,174
Can I make it work?"

751
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,442
So, I went out,
and I bought an LED shop light.

752
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,578
It's actually sitting
in our booth here.

753
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:07,781
It uses 48 watts
of light or power.

754
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,050
It looks nice and bright.

755
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:12,519
So, I grew the same plant,
the same nutrients,

756
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,421
everything, side by side.

757
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:17,257
The one on the left
was under the LED shop light.

758
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:20,494
The one on the right is our,
under one of our Procyon lights,

759
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,696
which use a tiny bit
less energy.

760
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:25,199
But that's sort of
the misconception

761
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:28,068
is that people think, "Well,
I've got a south-facing window."

762
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:32,673
Well, the days are still short,
they're still cloudy,

763
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,242
and the windows block
75% of the light

764
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:38,111
hitting 'em anyways
with the low-E coatings on 'em.

765
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:42,216
So, you need light, and light is
the magic that didn't,

766
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,117
that enables us to do this

767
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:47,487
when 10 years ago, you were
not able to do this before.

768
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,356
So, that is the magic.

769
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,391
So, we're gonna talk
a little bit about light.

770
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,595
So, most of us know that you
need decent temperature,

771
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:57,631
humidity, and you need nutrients
and water.

772
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:00,133
But light is something that
we've always taken for granted.

773
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,237
We assume the Sun is gonna shine
and make us, you know,

774
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,939
grow our plants, but the
winters, that doesn't work.

775
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,975
In the summers, it's fine.

776
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:11,044
So, this is
a interesting graph.

777
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,781
So, in the middle, you have
what's called

778
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:18,185
the visual spectrum
that our eyes see.

779
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:21,955
So, our eyes are very sensitive
to yellow and green light.

780
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:25,859
And so when we look out,
everything looks green,

781
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:28,028
and because our eyes are
so sensitive to green

782
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:31,231
and plants reflect
some level of green light.

783
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,700
So, when somebody talks
about lumens

784
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,570
or talks about foot-candles,

785
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:41,041
they're actually talking about
how our eyes perceive light,

786
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:43,610
but plants perceive light
very differently.

787
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:44,945
In fact, they use light.

788
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,382
They need red light
in much higher intensity levels

789
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:51,518
than our eyes,
you know, are sensitive to.

790
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:55,055
So, the chart on the top,
which says PAR,

791
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:57,457
Photosynthetically
Active Radiation,

792
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:00,460
is the energy plants use
to grow.

793
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,664
So, that is the big difference
between somebody

794
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:07,000
talking about a grow light,
so-called grow light

795
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:10,204
that you're buying on Amazon
or Menards.

796
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,939
They're nice and bright
to your eye,

797
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,642
but they're not
necessarily bright to the plant.

798
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:17,845
So, it's sort of
an important thing,

799
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:21,281
but it takes some time
to figure that out.

800
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,184
So, PAR energy
that plants need to grow.

801
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:27,221
So, it depends on the stage
of plant growth,

802
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:30,190
and basically,
for seed starting,

803
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:33,660
you can go, get by
with 50 to 200 micromoles,

804
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,730
or microgreens
also are relatively low.

805
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:39,600
But if you want to grow
plants to full maturity,

806
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:43,237
you want between 200
and 500 micromoles.

807
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:45,806
The units are micromoles
per square meter per second.

808
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:48,742
So, it's basically the amount of
photons hitting a certain area.

809
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,712
But if you're producing
a fruiting or a flowering plant,

810
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:54,448
you want even higher,
400 to 1,000.

811
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:56,984
So, if you're growing tomatoes,
you get a little closer.

812
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,553
And that's how you basically get
that level of light.

813
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,956
As long as your light is able
to produce that level,

814
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:04,224
you can grow
pretty much anything.

815
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,526
You're not gonna grow
watermelon,

816
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,261
you're not gonna grow
cantaloupe,

817
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,963
but you can grow
most other things that way.

818
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,600
So, this is a chart that is
a really, really important one.

819
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,937
So, this is research done
by Professor Erik Runkle

820
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:18,338
at Michigan State.

821
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,909
And what he did is he used
the same intensity of light,

822
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,877
but he varied the colors.

823
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:27,114
And so what he found is
that, basically,

824
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,649
the colors that you use,

825
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:31,952
even though the intensity
is the same, completely changes

826
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,388
what the plant looks like
and how big it is.

827
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,723
So, it turns out
that what you want is

828
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,693
60% to 70% of the light
to be red,

829
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:44,865
10% to 15% to be blue, and 20%,
roughly, to be green.

830
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:49,503
If you do that, not only will
the plants look really good,

831
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,905
but they'll grow
incredibly well.

832
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:54,808
So, what we've done is we've
worked with the research

833
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,110
done at Michigan State
and Purdue

834
00:37:57,177 --> 00:38:01,014
and optimized our lights to
actually give you those ratios

835
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,616
of red to blue to green.

836
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:06,320
So, a typical light like a
shop light or even a grow light

837
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:10,057
that you'd go buy
on Amazon or Home Depot

838
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:13,460
would actually be the one
that says "typical white light."

839
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:17,130
So, you could see the plant can
be two and a half times smaller

840
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,032
for the same amount
of input energy

841
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,702
than you would get
if you have the optimal light.

842
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:24,571
So, this is a really,
really important observation.

843
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:27,941
And so we use that knowledge
to basically optimize

844
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,978
what we're actually
manufacturing.

845
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:33,146
So, this is a spectral graph.

846
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,349
And what this does is,
on the left,

847
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,351
you can see the amount of red
we have.

848
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,953
You have a little bit of blue
and a little bit of green,

849
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,655
and that's really what you want.

850
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:44,691
A very typical, 4,000-Kelvin,
for instance, light,

851
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:46,894
you could see they have
a big blue spike

852
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,896
because the actual LEDs
are blue,

853
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:51,565
very little red,
and a lot in that green area.

854
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:55,769
So, that's the difference
between a successful light

855
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:59,006
that you would use
for growing at home.

856
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,375
So, the last thing, and this may
not be as important

857
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:04,111
for those of us
that are growing in our homes,

858
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,213
but basically, the efficiency
of the light.

859
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,050
You know, we have a customer in
Minneapolis called Urban Greens,

860
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,219
and they have 1,500
of our lights.

861
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:14,888
It's really important for them
that the lights are efficient

862
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:17,891
because the electric bill
is a big deal to their cost.

863
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,027
So, we do put a lot of effort
into that.

864
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:23,330
It may not be as important for
what we're talking about today,

865
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:25,632
but in the long run,
it is important

866
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,468
for many other
commercial applications.

867
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:31,872
So, there's a lot of specs
that, you know,

868
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,140
we won't get into much detail,

869
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,142
but one thing
you want to make sure you do

870
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,745
is the light has at least
200 micromoles

871
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:41,982
of photons per square meter
per second, PPFD,

872
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,951
to grow your plants
to full maturity,

873
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:47,421
you want blue light to be
more like 10%, 15%,

874
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,156
60% to 70% red.

875
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:50,991
Minimize energy use.

876
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,961
People say, "Well, I want a
light that uses a lot of power."

877
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,662
Well, I actually say
the opposite.

878
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,065
I want low power,
but lots of good light.

879
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,335
And that's really important,
but most people haven't,

880
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,270
don't have that mentality yet

881
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:05,839
on terms of how
to selecting a light.

882
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,841
You want to look for
a really good warranty

883
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:11,712
to make sure that light is
gonna last you a long time.

884
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:15,282
Basically, a good quality
LED light should be,

885
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:19,686
10, 15 years, you should still
be able to use it.

886
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:23,457
So, you know,
I'm a big believer in things

887
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,826
that you can make
in the United States.

888
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:30,230
LEDs are global,
and they do last a long time,

889
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:34,201
but it's how you put it together
and how you select it.

890
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,638
So, I won't put a lot of effort
or time or discussion on this,

891
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:40,807
but there's, you know,
if you wanted,

892
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:42,776
we could spend an hour,
probably, talking about

893
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,578
how to pick a good LED light,

894
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,514
but we'll,
if there's questions on that,

895
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:49,550
please contact me later.

896
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:53,153
So, seed starting, so, one
of the things that I would say

897
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,289
50% of the customers
I talk to here

898
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:58,025
want to use the light
for seed starting.

899
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,326
Big savings.

900
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:02,396
You can actually now,
instead of paying $3, $4, or $5

901
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,864
for a little seedling,

902
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:06,300
you can literally start it
in your basement,

903
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:09,169
and it's quick, and it's easy,
and it grows really well.

904
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:11,238
And it's gonna be
a very robust plant.

905
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,540
And you don't even
have to hardy it off

906
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:15,943
like you do a lot of plants that
are grown under fluorescents,

907
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:17,945
because they're gonna be
a lot stronger

908
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:21,148
because they have
the right kind of lighting.

909
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:24,084
The quality of the light
makes a huge difference.

910
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:26,186
The plant will grow faster
and healthier.

911
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:30,290
I always say, if you're starting
with a good quality LED light,

912
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:33,026
start two weeks, at least, later

913
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:34,528
than you would have
with a fluorescent,

914
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,197
because a lot of times,
the plants get too big,

915
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,700
if you're not, you know,
if you're growing 'em

916
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:41,168
under a high-quality light

917
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:43,637
versus what you've
been used to doing.

918
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:47,140
So, that makes
a huge difference.

919
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:50,043
So, fluorescents, I would say

920
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,280
that fluorescents will probably
not even be available

921
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,883
other than for those
that were saved in our basements

922
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,352
for years
in the next few years.

923
00:41:58,418 --> 00:42:01,488
They contain mercury,
they're not very efficient.

924
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:04,925
You gotta
constantly replace the bulbs.

925
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,160
And why would you need
a fluorescent

926
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:08,795
for anything other,
I don't think

927
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,430
these are even fluorescent
in here anymore,

928
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:14,067
so everything
is really becoming LEDs.

929
00:42:14,134 --> 00:42:17,337
So, seed sources
for seed starting and growing,

930
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,206
you know, these are
just a handful

931
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:21,775
of the different customers
or the companies

932
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:23,110
that we've worked with.

933
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:24,344
Jung is a great one.

934
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:26,413
We work closely with them.

935
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,750
Seed Savers in Iowa is
also a really, really good one.

936
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:32,052
They have all organic seeds.

937
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,255
Johnny's in Maine,
especially for microgreens,

938
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:37,624
but they carry seeds
for everything.

939
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,493
Baker Creek Seeds.

940
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:43,964
I literally could probably put
a dozen more seed companies

941
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:45,699
onto this list.

942
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:49,169
Store 'em
in your refrigerator in a bag.

943
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,538
Keep 'em cool
so they don't get wet.

944
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:54,274
The humidity can, you know,
literally destroy the seeds,

945
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:57,578
but otherwise, seeds can last
for years and years.

946
00:42:57,644 --> 00:43:00,547
The other thing that I would say
is read the packet.

947
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:01,715
Look at the back.

948
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:03,617
So, they often
will tell you when to plant,

949
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:08,222
how to plant, how deep to plant,
how to store.

950
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:11,992
That is really a great starting
place for seed starting.

951
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:15,229
Most of you probably that
are gardeners know all of that.

952
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:17,464
So, it's just a little bit
of difference

953
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:20,100
with using LEDs to get started.

954
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:25,305
So, media, potting mixes,
are, or seed-starting mixes

955
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:30,744
are another type of media
that you can use.

956
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:34,147
I personally use coconut coir
and vermiculite,

957
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:37,851
just like I do
for growing all of the plants

958
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:39,586
that I want to indoors.

959
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:43,056
So, I literally use
the seed starting trays,

960
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,326
and I plant the seeds,
but then I use the nutrients,

961
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:50,130
the same nutrients that I use
in these jars

962
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:53,367
to keep the nutrients level
correct.

963
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:55,802
And they will grow
extremely well.

964
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:57,771
So, I don't,
and the other thing is

965
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,574
I found that the potting mixes
are expensive.

966
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:03,644
You know, you could literally
spend a few dollars,

967
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,147
you know, just for a small batch
of this potting mix,

968
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:10,284
whereas the coconut coir
is very, very inexpensive

969
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,019
to grow with.

970
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:15,222
So, moisture and watering.

971
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,424
Humidity domes
can help germinate,

972
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:21,662
but I actually don't use 'em,
other than for microgreens.

973
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,564
You can use 'em
if you have some issues

974
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,901
with the humidity levels being
really, really too low.

975
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:29,903
And then some people overwater.

976
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,841
If you overwater, you get
something called "damping off."

977
00:44:33,907 --> 00:44:35,876
But basically,
if your plant starts dying,

978
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,946
you're getting a fungus on it,
and it often,

979
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,448
you know, will be gone quickly.

980
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,784
So, I guess, really,
you want something

981
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,286
that the water will drain
through it

982
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,955
and go down into the tray

983
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:51,658
so that you don't have this
issue with the fungus on it.

984
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:53,360
Temperature and humidity.

985
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:56,630
So, basically,
lettuce will germinate

986
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:59,032
at very low temperatures.

987
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,034
And then you could see
the range of temperatures.

988
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:05,239
When you start getting into
peppers, tomatoes, and eggplant,

989
00:45:05,305 --> 00:45:07,641
they often may need a heat mat.

990
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,977
So, that's something
where, you know,

991
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:12,312
either if your humidity level
is too high,

992
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,248
that's where a dome will help,

993
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:16,483
or if your temperature's
too low,

994
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,385
then you may actually want
a heat mat

995
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:20,420
to help you get started.

996
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:22,322
There's an off-the-grid
greenhouse

997
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,559
that I've worked on
in Oregon, Illinois,

998
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:27,728
that doesn't have any heating
in it

999
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:31,198
and it doesn't have any power
coming to the building,

1000
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:34,635
and we're growing
all year long inside it.

1001
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:37,037
And so what we're finding is
certain types of plants

1002
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:39,540
will grow really well as long
as you have light over 'em.

1003
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:41,775
So, we use solar panels

1004
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:43,744
to charge up
a 48-volt battery bank.

1005
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,747
And those basically drive
the LEDs,

1006
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:48,882
and it uses passive solar

1007
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,552
to basically keep the building
from ever freezing.

1008
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:53,787
So, there are things
you can grow all year long

1009
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:57,624
without any electricity
and without any heat.

1010
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:00,994
So, but you've got to pick the
right varieties to do that with.

1011
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,997
So, heat mats, most of you
are probably familiar with 'em.

1012
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:07,067
I would say they're really
more necessary

1013
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:09,369
for tomatoes, peppers,
and eggplants.

1014
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,438
So, those are the three
varieties that need to be

1015
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:15,108
a little bit warmer
to properly germinate.

1016
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:17,177
And again,
I think we mentioned earlier,

1017
00:46:17,244 --> 00:46:19,112
when do you start seeds?

1018
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,981
So, I always say, you know,

1019
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:23,650
a lot of the back
of these envelopes

1020
00:46:23,717 --> 00:46:26,420
may say a date
or give you a date,

1021
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,488
but a lot of that
is based on the fact

1022
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:31,124
that you're using a fluorescent
to start with.

1023
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,793
But now
that you may be switching

1024
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,129
to a higher-quality light,
start two weeks later,

1025
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:37,865
otherwise, you
may be disappointed.

1026
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,933
That's the one story
that I've heard is, like,

1027
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,603
"Vic, I started too early,
and now my plants are too big,

1028
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,204
"and I can't, you know,
I, you know,

1029
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,806
"I don't know
what to do with 'em

1030
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:47,608
"because I can't put 'em
in the ground yet

1031
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,009
'cause it's still too cold out."

1032
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,711
So, that's one thing
I always say,

1033
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:52,212
start a little bit later.

1034
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,116
And I usually say, around here,
probably April 1

1035
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,051
is probably a good start date,
so that,

1036
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,687
I usually plant right around
May 15, so that gives me

1037
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:04,491
about five or six weeks
to get them going.

1038
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:06,360
So, quick summary.

1039
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:10,364
You can actually grow your
own food at home all year long.

1040
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,168
So, I hope some of you see that
that makes sense.

1041
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:18,272
Simple passive hydroponic
methods make it easy

1042
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,840
and, I would say, fun.

1043
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:21,241
So, those are the two things.

1044
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:23,710
You know, it's easy, it's fun,
and you can actually eat it.

1045
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:25,679
So, for me, I,
a lot of people say,

1046
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:27,781
"Well, will it grow flowers?"

1047
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:29,650
And the answer is yes.

1048
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:32,085
But I like things to grow,
to eat.

1049
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:35,789
And so basically that's
what I concentrate on.

1050
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,425
And I would say,
I would guarantee

1051
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:41,595
that anyone who wants to
can basically do this,

1052
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:44,431
and if for some reason,
they're struggling with it,

1053
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:46,867
call me and let me know,
and we'll walk through it

1054
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:49,236
and make sure you're successful.

1055
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:52,673
And again, I listen to all
people that I've talked to

1056
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,908
for years at the show here,
and it's,

1057
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:56,443
that's the most fun
of being here,

1058
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,911
is listening how happy they are

1059
00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:00,280
with being able
to do this all year long.

1060
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:05,452
So, but the key to all of this
is high-quality LED lighting.

1061
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,888
And the initial investment
is very reasonable.

1062
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,957
In fact,
if you're growing microgreens,

1063
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,326
usually, it will
pay for everything you need

1064
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,228
within a matter of three months.

1065
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:16,864
And if you're growing
lettuces and herbs,

1066
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,566
which have a little lower value

1067
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,768
of what, compared to what
you're paying for in the store,

1068
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:25,072
it may take six months,
but basically, this allows you

1069
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:27,674
to pretty much grow
anything you want.

1070
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:31,845
And again, I encourage you
to go on to our YouTube channel

1071
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:35,382
and effectively watch
the videos.

1072
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:38,986
It'll teach you how to do this,
and it'll give you what you need

1073
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:41,088
and the mistakes,
maybe, that you make.

1074
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:42,823
And we try to do videos

1075
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,492
on all these different types
of products.

1076
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:48,295
And then our website is
HappyLeafLED,

1077
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,764
and there's videos on there
and testimonials on there.

1078
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:53,000
So, there's plenty
of resources

1079
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,868
to help you get started.

1080
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,970
So, I think that's it.

1081
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:59,173
Thank you.
