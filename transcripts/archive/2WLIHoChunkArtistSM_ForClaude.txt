- Melanie Tallmadge Sainz:
Being creative

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,214
is such a healthy way
to engage in one's life.

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:19,152
I usually try to start my day
being creative, yeah.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,755
My name is
Melanie Tallmadge Sainz.

6
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,057
I am a creative maker
and artist,

7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,526
cultural arts presenter,

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,194
as well as the
founding director

9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:30,397
of Little Eagle
Arts Foundation.

10
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,133
Little Eagle
Arts Foundation,

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,169
sometimes we go
by the acronym LEAF.

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,338
We are a standalone,
Native-run, 501c3.

13
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,309
Little Eagle was
my father's Indian name.

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,281
Growing up, I was always
around Native art,

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,983
and it was just kinda,
through osmosis,

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,188
it was something that I was
always so inspired by.

17
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,290
You know, it's something
that we as Native peoples,

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,958
we've been using the quill
of the porcupine

19
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:01,628
long before the introduction
of the glass bead.

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,830
So, like, maybe your grandma
did cross-stitching

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,232
or needlepoint or embroidery.

22
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,102
She would probably use
a cotton floss, like a thread.

23
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,172
I substitute porcupine quills.

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,644
I just have always wanted

25
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,514
to capture the portrait
of people

26
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,516
that have been
really important to me

27
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,552
as a human being
and growing up.

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,856
To be able to take kinda those,
use of light and darks

29
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,424
in terms of the
tonal qualities

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,226
that you see in a face,

31
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,329
and adapt a whole range
of dyed quills

32
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,764
to match up those
tonal qualities,

33
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,166
and then to utilize
the quills

34
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,835
to kinda match up the
mosaic kinda qualities,

35
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,804
almost like pop art.

36
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,242
One of the places that
I get the most inspiration

37
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,210
is just opening
the garage door here

38
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,013
and walking amongst the land.

39
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,381
Doing sketches of,
you know,

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,452
the flora and fauna
in the area, or the landscape.

41
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,421
Sometimes that can
inspire me.

42
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,692
You can't get any closer to
the connection with the earth

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,361
than working in clay,

44
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,530
and I've been
all over the country,

45
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,798
and I've been to different
parts of the world,

46
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,467
Japan and Guatemala
and Spain,

47
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,635
and I'm always looking

48
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,104
for natural sources of clay,
you know.

49
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,641
Because the use
of clay is universal.

50
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,813
The thing I love
about our Native peoples

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,451
is they're always so willing
to share and advise.

52
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,253
You know, art has a way

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,790
of really bringing people
together.

54
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,393
Good things come
to those who wait,

55
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,062
and art, sometimes
it takes a little longer

56
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,797
than anticipated.

57
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,534
But I think it's worth it,
in my opinion.
