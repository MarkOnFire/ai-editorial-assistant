about this county park.

- Ann Grzywnowicz:
I think what makes it
the most special

333
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,125
is that
all of the statues

334
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,041
were created by one artist,
Fred Smith,

335
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,959
and he created them all
over a 16-year period,

336
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,667
and so he was working very hard
throughout those 16 years.

He was very inspired.

are featured in the park?

340
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,417
- He kind of took inspiration
from many different areas.

341

He really liked to focus on some
of the local people around,

national importance.

winters, the weather,
