1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,841
- Kai: This is how you play
Sushi.

2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,543
All right, are you ready?

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,777
- Kids: Yeah!
- Great.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,079
It's so easy.

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,515
All you have to do
is what I say.

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,517
So if I say, "One,"
you clap your hands.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,851
One.
[hands clapping]

8
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,019
One.
[hands clapping]

9
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,187
One.
[hands clapping]

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,355
Easy.

11
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,056
When I say, "Two,"
you say, "Sushi,"

12
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,892
and cross your arms
over your knee.

13
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,493
Two.
- Sushi!

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,161
- Yeah, two!
- Sushi!

15
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,396
- Very nice.

16
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,099
When I say "Three," you put
your hand in the air

17
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,467
and you say, "Waffles."

18
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,002
Three.
- Waffles!

19
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,436
- Three!
- Waffles!

20
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,238
- You can go,
get a little hip action.

21
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,406
Waffles!

22
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,574
Three.
- Waffles!

23
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,909
- Great, great, great.

24
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,611
When I say, "Four," you're gonna
look around for a door,

25
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,812
and you're gonna point at it,

26
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,015
and you're going to say,
"Point at the door."

27
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,217
So, four.
- Point at the door!

28
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,852
- Four!
- Point at the door!

29
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,654
- Four!
- Point at the door!

30
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,289
- Yes, when I say, "Five,"

31
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,757
you're gonna crouch down
a little,

32
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,092
you're gonna stick your hands
out for some jazz hands,

33
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,694
and you're gonna say,
"Showtime."

34
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,862
- Showtime.

35
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,330
- Five.
- Showtime.

36
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,932
- Yeah, that's all
we have to do.

37
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,767
Now, I'm gonna say them
out of order.

38
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,203
I'm gonna mix them up
and I'm gonna try to trick you,

39
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,139
so you have to pay
really close attention.

40
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,908
And if you get stuck,
you can look to your neighbor

41
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,577
and see what they're doing,
okay?

42
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,911
Ready?

43
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,313
One.
[hands clapping]

44
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,514
One.
[hands clapping]

45
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,316
Three.
- Waffles!

46
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,784
- Three.
- Waffles!

47
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,686
- Four.
- Point at the door!

48
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,454
- Four.
- Point at the door!

49
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,289
- Two.
- Sushi!

50
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,691
- Almost got you.

51
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,925
Two!
- Sushi!

52
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,327
- One.
[hands clapping]

53
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,962
One.
[hands clapping]

54
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,663
Three.
- Waffles!

55
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,398
- Five.
- Showtime!

56
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,566
- One.
[hands clapping]

57
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,734
One.
[hands clapping]

58
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,902
One.
[hands clapping]

59
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,103
One, one, one, one, one, one!

60
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,538
Oh, you shouldn't, thank you,
oh, stop.

61
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,706
Please stop, thank you.

62
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,342
And that's how you play Sushi!

63
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,177
Think your class can handle it?

64
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,979
You can even try adding
a number.

65
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,814
What if you said, "six?"

66
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,982
What would you add?

67
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,717
Good luck!
