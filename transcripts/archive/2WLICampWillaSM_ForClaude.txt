- Susan Schwaab:
When you're up in the air
and you're flying,

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,279
you don't think
about anything else.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,547
You're just flying.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,116
It's what you're doing
and right where you are.

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,352
And that's
a beautiful feeling.

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,187
So, there's
a whole host of things

9
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,390
that make flying
pretty amazing.

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,894
- Fareed Guyot: So, you see
the emergency exits?

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,931
Camp Willa is a program of the
Willa Brown Aviation Academy.

12
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,768
It is a five-day day camp
during the summer

13
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,503
where we introduce kids,

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,374
mostly from underserved
and underrepresented
communities,

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,009
to aviation,

16
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,078
and all the possibilities,
from just being an enthusiast,

17
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,415
enjoying aviation, maybe being
a recreational pilot,

18
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,684
all the way up to
making it a career option.

19
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,419
[upbeat music]

20
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,957
- Right now,
female airline pilots are 6%

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,960
of the airline pilot crew.

22
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,162
Pilots of color are 3%.

23
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,665
And it's just
such an awesome job.

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,334
I never knew about it,
you know, as a girl.

25
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,571
I didn't grow up working on cars
and being around airplanes.

26
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,874
Until I met someone
that took me flying,

27
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,309
it never occurred to me.

28
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,677
So, that's what we want.

29
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,579
We want them
to just know it's out there.

30
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,314
When you get your flight,

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,951
you'll see the world from
a totally different perspective.

32
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,087
- We have somewhere
between 18 to 22 campers,

33
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,655
and this is our third year.

34
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,791
So we give 'em presentations
about aerodynamics

35
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,227
and even the lights
they see at the airport.

36
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,996
And then we take 'em on
a one-on-one airplane ride

37
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,298
toward the end of the week,
and they're just like,

38
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,234
"Man, this is awesome!

39
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,568
I never thought of this before."

40
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,337
And that's pretty much
the same comment.

41
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,172
- Student: I thought
I would never do this,

42
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,740
but as y'all can see,

43
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,576
I'm gonna fly
this little whatever,
plane, jet, whatever this is.

44
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,479
I'm gonna fly it today and we
gonna have a fun time, right?

45
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,747
- Fareed Guyot:
That's right.

46
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,749
When they
come back from that flight,

47
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,253
we want to see
that "post-flight grin,"
as I call it.

48
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,989
And a lot of people say
that they just love
that "aviator grin."

49
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,390
They're like,
"Oh, that was great."

50
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,060
- Whew, we did it.
[laughs]                  - Yay.

51
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,896
- Susan Schwaab:
I think they have the feeling

52
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,865
that if they can fly an
airplane, what else can they do?

53
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,369
You know,
that's the goal of the camp.

54
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,672
To just show them the
opportunities that are out there

55
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,307
to give them confidence

56
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:24,278
and also to talk to 'em
about what it takes,

57
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,747
the discipline
and the schooling.

58
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,950
So, all of that,
it's just a nice package.

59
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,418
And this is called
the pitot tube.

60
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,222
If you fall in love with this
and you love it, do it.

61
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,757
It's gonna be a lot of work.

62
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,724
It's gonna be hard.

63
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,560
It's gonna take
quite a long time.

64
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,061
Don't do it
for the money.

65
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,130
Don't do it for the glamour.
[chuckles]

66
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,866
But do it because
you have a passion for it.

67
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,034
- You're doing great.

68
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,635
Would you like to try a turn?

69
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,205
I'm a flight instructor,
and I just want to teach

70
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,707
as many people as possible
about flying,

71
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,808
whether they wanna fly

72
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,677
or just about
flying and aviation

73
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,712
and how crucial it is
to our economy,

74
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,281
but also just
how enjoyable it is

75
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,784
and the community
around us is fun.
