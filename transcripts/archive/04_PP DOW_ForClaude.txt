00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,833
When we think of 1960s student
protest culture,

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:06,600
we tend to assume that students
were uniformly against the war in Vietnam.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,700
But for much of the 1960s,
that wasn't always the case.

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,333
In the early to mid 1960s,
most students at UW Madison either

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,800
didn't care much about the war in 
Vietnam, or favored total military victory.

6
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:21,400
All that would change by the decade's
end, when thousands of students

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,166
were regularly protesting
against American involvement in Vietnam.

8
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:26,566
So what happened?

9
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:31,633
A big factor was the now infamous
Dow Chemical protest in October 1967.

10
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,233
Student protesters
were attempting to discourage

11
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,633
and then physically block people
from interviewing

12
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:40,633
with Dow Chemical Company,
who had come to UW to recruit for jobs.

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,733
Dow chemical was manufacturing 
napalm, a kind of flammable gel

14
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:47,766
that was being used
by American forces in Vietnam.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,100
The student protesters were ultimately 
met with police violence,

16
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:55,833
as the police used batons and tear gas
in their efforts to disperse the students.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,133
This marked
the first time a Vietnam-related protest

18
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,133
was met with such violence
on a university campus.

19
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:05,833
Images and accounts of bloodied 
students and state-sanctioned violence

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,000
shook many people into taking a side.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,833
This, along with the nightly news
reports of the devastation in Vietnam,

22
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:14,933
would ultimately contribute
to growing anti-war sentiments

23
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:18,033
by many young people
at UW and across the nation.
