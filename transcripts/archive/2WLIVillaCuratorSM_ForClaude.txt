1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,873
- Angela Fitzgerald:
Phoenix S. Brown is a curator,

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,776
helping other people share
their story through art.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,378
- Phoenix S. Brown: As curator,
my responsibility

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,380
is to program
the gallery spaces.

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,750
I coordinate artists,
I develop exhibitions,

6
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,086
I help run creative programming

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,788
in response to the art
that's on the wall.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,056
Very powerful piece by...

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,727
- Angela: Phoenix works
in this space, Gallery 507,

10
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,329
at the Bronzeville Center
for the Arts.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,031
- This organization was started
by artists,

12
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,699
which is really exciting.

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,967
I'm also an artist,

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,437
so I love learning about how
artists make their work.

15
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,839
- Angela: This artistic hub,

16
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,108
located on Milwaukee's
north side,

17
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:46,647
is rooted in art, culture,
and African-American history.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,615
- Phoenix: Bronzeville
is a cultural overlay

19
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,684
of, like, a few neighborhoods
here in Milwaukee.

20
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,288
Black residents have been here
since the early 19th century,

21
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,223
so the neighborhood
is really known

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,293
for Black cultural production.

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,228
- Angela: In addition
to her work

24
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,531
in the Bronzeville neighborhood,
Phoenix has curated work

25
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:08,535
in some of Milwaukee's most
prestigious mansions.

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,337
- Phoenix: At the turn
of the 20th century,

27
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,039
this was considered
the Gold Coast.

28
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,374
There was a lot of wealthy
families building mansions

29
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,443
along this corridor.

30
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,213
This home was the homestead

31
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,114
of Sarah Ball Allis
and Charles Allis.

32
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,583
They were industrialists,

33
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,853
and Charles Allis was the
president of Allis Chalmers.

34
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,154
- Angela: The Allis mansion

35
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:31,225
is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places.

36
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,795
As curator, Phoenix would find
contemporary artists

37
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,966
searching for a temporary place
to showcase their work.

38
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,869
- The room that we're in right
now is called the French parlor.

39
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,071
On this wall, we have a lot
of French oil paintings

40
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,305
that are, like,
beautifully framed.

41
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,407
Everything is original
to the collection.

42
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,111
And then also in the space,
we juxtapose contemporary art

43
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,414
next to, like,
the historic works.

44
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,753
- I'll just hand you one, and
then I'll take the other one.

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,021
- Phoenix: And our previous
exhibitions

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,823
have kind of responded to, like,
people who identify

47
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,560
as LGBTQIA here in the community
and people of color,

48
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,862
so thinking about
critical issues of identity

49
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,065
and hierarchies of power
and feminism.

50
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,234
- Angela: When Sarah Allis
passed away,

51
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,204
she had one last wish
for her art collection

52
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,040
and this Tudor-style home.

53
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,808
- Phoenix: In the will,
she dictated that

54
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,277
whoever runs the home

55
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,414
must inspire, delight, and
educate with the collections.

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,651
- Angela: For three years,
Phoenix was that person

57
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,819
honoring Sarah's wish.

58
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,555
- Phoenix: This place
is special.

59
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,823
It's like a gem
of historic relevance

60
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,959
that I think people
often overlook,

61
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,129
and it holds a lot
of Milwaukee history.

62
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,430
- Angela: At the same time

63
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,100
Phoenix was overseeing
the art collection at the Allis,

64
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,871
she was helping reclaim another
piece of Milwaukee's past

65
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:54,174
a short walk away
at Villa Terrace.

66
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,946
- Phoenix: It was the original
home to Lloyd and Agnes Smith

67
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,381
of the A. O. Smith Company.

68
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,484
Villa Terrace was constructed
in 1924.

69
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,220
The inspiration
for the villa came

70
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,022
when the family went to Italy.

71
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,224
It kind of appears as though

72
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,660
that you may be on the
Mediterranean Sea.

73
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,530
- Angela: Preserving the
vestiges of power and privilege

74
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:20,734
was not lost on Phoenix
as she curated the mansions.

75
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,337
These are two homes that were
owned by white people.

76
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,239
So, like, finding ways to make
those accessible

77
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:29,676
to our largest populations here
is really important.

78
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,011
Welcoming communities in

79
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,880
that may have never felt
welcomed before

80
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,615
'cause it is intimidating.

81
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,150
You don't really know what's
possible for yourself

82
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,886
unless you see someone
that looks like you

83
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,320
doing the same thing.

84
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,123
And luckily in my life, I've had
people who are people of color

85
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,792
in these sorts of positions.

86
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,861
- Angela: Every place
Phoenix works,

87
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:52,199
representation and access are
at the center of her mission.

88
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,001
- Phoenix: They are the first
two Black men

89
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,503
to be on a baseball team
and be brothers.

90
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,771
This is important to me

91
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,440
'cause it feels like I am giving
a platform to people

92
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,276
that haven't had it in the past.

93
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,011
And sometimes, it's best
for people of color

94
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,512
to tell their own stories,
you know?

95
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,781
That's, like, a privilege
that we don't always get

96
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,516
in this sort of sphere.

97
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,385
I think it just really
emphasizes the impact

98
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,188
that he's had on the
Negro League baseball league

99
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,923
here in America.

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,192
And I think it's important
to keep telling these stories

101
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,294
and hold these stories so
Milwaukeeans in the future

102
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,464
are able to learn about
where we came from as a city.

103
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,667
- Angela: The art sphere
Phoenix creates

104
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,636
is welcoming for all
of Milwaukee,

105
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,872
whether that is at a
mansion museum

106
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,575
or in the heart of Bronzeville.

107
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,343
[Phoenix chuckles]
- I love curatorial.

108
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,078
Curatorial is amazing,

109
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,347
and it's a privilege to be
in these roles.

110
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,616
And I just love working
with artists.

111
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,151
It brings me joy.

112
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,552
But then also,
it's kind of like,

113
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,957
people just doing
really cool stuff. [laughs]

114
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,593
