00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,237
- Sarah Corso: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,573
Welcome, and thank you for
coming to tonight's Badger Talk,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,976
brought to you by UW Connects.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,677
My name is Sarah Corso,

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,946
and I'm a librarian
and access services manager

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,749
here at the Oak Creek
Public Library.

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,885
I'm pleased
to introduce our guest,

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,553
Dr. Thomas Beatty,

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,889
assistant professor
in the Astronomy Department

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,291
for the College
of Letters & Science

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,194
at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison.

12
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:30,230
The presentation he is giving
this evening is called

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,734
"How Can We Find Other Life
in the Universe?"

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,170
Dr. Beatty is from
Riverside, Connecticut,

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,039
and grew up sailing
off the coast of New England.

16
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,909
He has a bachelor's degree
from Harvard University,

17
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,978
a master's degree
in physics from MIT,

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,349
and a PhD in astronomy
from Ohio State University.

19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,685
Before moving to Madison,

20
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,854
he worked
as an instrument scientist

21
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,290
on the James Webb
Space Telescope,

22
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,825
where he helped build
one of Webb's cameras

23
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,529
and helped to operate it
once Webb reached space.

24
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,499
His research focuses
on measuring the atmospheres

25
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,102
of exoplanets--
planets around other stars--

26
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,471
to figure out
what they are made out of

27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,075
and what their climates are like
to understand how planets form

28
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,879
and to search for life
elsewhere in the universe.

29
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,349
He has also discovered
nine new exoplanets,

30
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,620
none of which he got to name
after himself, sadly.

31
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,190
Today, we are asking,
"Are we alone in the universe?"

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,094
This question has been asked
for over 2,000 years,

33
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,331
and now we possess the tools
and techniques necessary

34
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,233
to answer it.

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,202
Dr. Beatty will discuss
what we want to look for

36
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,439
on other planets
to see if there is life,

37
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,542
as well as how this search
has begun at UW

38
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,411
using current
and future telescopes.

39
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,014
Please join me
in welcoming Dr. Beatty.

40
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,316
[audience applauding]

41
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,688
- Thomas G. Beatty:
Thank you very much.

42
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,123
That was a very nice
introduction.

43
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,458
It's a pleasure to be here.

44
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,693
I actually, coincidentally,
am in the universe.

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,396
And, really, how can
we find life elsewhere,

46
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,133
and how are we trying
to approach this problem

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,436
at UW and, in general,
in the astronomical community

48
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,273
to try and solve this question?

49
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,176
And I like to begin
talks like this

50
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,411
with just sort of a picture
of the night sky

51
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,681
and the thought, the idea,
that in many ways,

52
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:31,118
astronomy is sort of, you know,
the second-oldest profession

53
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,120
in the world--
being an astronomer, right?

54
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,422
It's probably the oldest science
that we have

55
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,425
in the sense of
you could imagine people,

56
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,662
very early people in Africa,
just looking up at the night sky

57
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,031
and wondering
what is going on up there,

58
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,799
what's going on with the stars,

59
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,036
and that, fundamentally,
is what my job is.

60
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,637
What we do as astronomers
today is,

61
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,339
we're still looking up
at the night sky,

62
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,074
and we're still
trying to figure out

63
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,844
what's going on with the stars.

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,847
And, in particular,
I work on exoplanets,

65
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,515
so I look for planets
around other stars,

66
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,550
and we're trying to measure
these planets around other stars

67
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,353
and figure out if there's
planets like the Earth

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,222
elsewhere in the galaxy.

69
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,859
That question, the idea that
there might be another planet

70
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,862
like the Earth
somewhere up there,

71
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,331
probably--
it's a little bit fuzzy--

72
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,833
was probably first posed
by the ancient Greeks

73
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,436
about 2,500 years ago,
probably the first person

74
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,471
to, at least,
write that question down.

75
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,875
Maybe people
thought of it before that.

76
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,546
So we're really thinking today
very concretely

77
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,214
about how do we
answer this question:

78
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,616
Is there a planet like the Earth

79
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,084
somewhere else
in the universe?

80
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,086
And it's a question that people
have been wondering about

81
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,388
for over two millennia,

82
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,258
and we're very close
to actually answering it,

83
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,692
and that's the topic

84
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,529
of what I'd like to talk
to you about tonight.

85
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,664
So I wanna begin
by just talking

86
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,200
about what is an exoplanet,
right?

87
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,602
What does that mean when
I talk about an exoplanet?

88
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,337
What are those?

89
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,741
So in the solar system,

90
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,343
we have our planets
in our solar system.

91
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,579
We have all the planets
that go around the Sun,

92
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,247
so the planets
go around the Sun,

93
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,749
those are planets,

94
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,085
and an exoplanet
is simply a planet

95
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,055
that orbits a star
other than the Sun.

96
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,223
So just like the Sun

97
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,958
has a solar system
of planets around it,

98
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,994
there are other exoplanet
systems around other stars

99
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,731
elsewhere in our galaxy
that we know of.

100
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,534
In galactic terms,

101
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,539
most of the planets
that we are looking at

102
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,076
are very close by in the terms
of the universe, right?

103
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,813
All the planets that we know of
are within the Milky Way galaxy.

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,451
This is a nice map produced
by Professor Bob Benjamin,

105
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,320
who's at UW, right,

106
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,088
showing what
the Milky Way looks like,

107
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,090
so all the planets that
we're thinking about looking at

108
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,827
and know about
are within the Milky Way galaxy,

109
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,330
and they're actually
very close to the sun,

110
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,098
within the Milky Way galaxy,
right?

111
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:01,101
This red circle is
about the limit of detection,

112
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,171
so where we've seen exoplanets,
how far out we've seen them.

113
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,773
If I zoom back out
on the entire galaxy,

114
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,877
you can see we've actually been
probing a very small segment

115
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,679
just of our local corner
of the universe, right?

116
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,381
We now know of
a lot of exoplanets,

117
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,383
but all of them
are very close by

118
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,252
on an astronomical scale.

119
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,453
They're all within our galaxy,

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,823
and they're all close
within our galaxy.

121
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,226
All together,
over the last 25 years--

122
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,895
30 years now,

123
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,265
we've now discovered
over 5,000 exoplanets.

124
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,336
I think the count as of
this morning was 5,761, right?

125
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,740
And if you look
at this graph, right,

126
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,910
you can see there's actually
a lot of sort of features here

127
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,478
you could think
about teasing out.

128
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,214
So I've marked on this slide,

129
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,449
the capital J
is where Jupiter is,

130
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,119
and the capital E
is where the Earth is,

131
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,720
and you can see we have

132
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,756
a whole bunch of planets
that are like Jupiter,

133
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,958
we have a whole bunch
of planets that are like Earth,

134
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,560
and a whole bunch of things
in between,

135
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,762
and, in particular, we also have
a whole bunch of planets

136
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,431
that don't even really exist
in our solar system, right?

137
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,000
A lot of the ways that even
we astronomers conceptualize

138
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,570
what these planets look like
is by thinking about

139
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,739
how do they compare to a planet
in the solar system.

140
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,508
Are they, like, a hot Jupiter?

141
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,510
Are they a super-Earth?

142
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,911
Are they a warm Saturn?

143
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,079
We use words like that,

144
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,582
but there is a whole class
of planets,

145
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,283
like super-Earths
or sub-Neptunes,

146
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,285
that don't actually exist
in the solar system.

147
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,487
And so, by finding
all these new planets,

148
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,224
we're actually uncovering
new processes

149
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,392
and physics
that we didn't know about

150
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,229
before we knew
that these planets existed.

151
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,766
And this has been a lot
of the work of the last 30 years

152
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,336
in this field,
is finding new planets,

153
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,238
getting this number
to go from one--

154
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,507
the first one
was discovered in 1995--

155
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,710
getting it from
1 to 5,761, right?

156
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,580
That's taken a lot of work,
and it's taken over two decades

157
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:58,318
of people finding new planets
around other stars.

158
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:02,289
Most of these are discovered
indirectly, right?

159
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,492
We actually-- of those
over 5,000 exoplanets,

160
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,897
we only have direct images where
we can see them in a photograph

161
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,368
or an image for only a handful,
probably about a dozen.

162
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,237
Most of these, we never actually
see the planet directly.

163
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,840
Instead, what we see is,
we see the planet's effect

164
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,509
on the star
that it's orbiting, right?

165
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,880
So one way, on the left there,
one way that we see the planet

166
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,783
affecting its star is that
we can look at the star,

167
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,619
we can measure the velocity
of the star,

168
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,522
and we see the star moving
back and forth a little bit

169
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,193
because the planet as it orbits
the star is tugging on the star,

170
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,162
and the star itself
is moving just a little bit

171
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,198
as the planet orbits around it,

172
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,400
and so we can see
that motion of the star

173
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,669
with our telescopes, right,
so we see the star moving,

174
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,071
and we know it must be a planet
based on that motion.

175
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,373
We never actually see
the planet itself.

176
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,210
Another way we discover planets,
that's on the right,

177
00:07:56,276 --> 00:08:00,013
is, we look, and as a planet
goes in front of a star,

178
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,949
it will block out
part of that star,

179
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,750
and the light from the star
will go down.

180
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,453
So Jupiter going
in front of the Sun

181
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,722
would make the Sun get dimmer

182
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,592
by about 1%
for a couple of hours,

183
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,760
and then it would
go back up again, right?

184
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,495
And we can detect planets
that way.

185
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,232
Actually, that technique
has gotten--

186
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,434
We're all sufficiently good
at doing that

187
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:25,172
that I'm actually with a couple
of students looking,

188
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,008
trying to detect a new planet--
or confirm a new planet

189
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,576
from the roof
of the Astronomy Department

190
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,514
in downtown Madison
sometime next week.

191
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,983
So that sort of measurement
for a Jupiter

192
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,485
in front of a Sun-like star
has gotten relatively easy

193
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,387
with modern technology.

194
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,589
Planets like the Earth
is a lot harder, right?

195
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,293
The Earth is 10,000 times
less of a signal

196
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,462
that we have to measure, right,

197
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,233
but the real point
to just take away from this is,

198
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,035
we have a lot of ways
to detect planets.

199
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,837
We've found a lot,
and we know a lot

200
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,640
from just their masses
and their radii and their sizes

201
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,942
and where they are
relative to their stars,

202
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,945
but we still never actually
see the planet directly, right?

203
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,747
We just see what it does
to the star.

204
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,583
We don't have
a lot of information

205
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,586
about what is happening
on the planet itself.

206
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:16,023
And so if we're thinking about
detecting life on an exoplanet,

207
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,359
figuring out if it's habitable,
if it's like the Earth, right,

208
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,828
what we will start with
is something like this.

209
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,531
This is a simulated light curve,

210
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,533
so measurements
of the brightness of a star,

211
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,869
as a planet like the Earth
goes in front of it.

212
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,470
So if we were looking
at the Sun

213
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,072
and the Earth
passed in front of it,

214
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,273
this is what we would see.

215
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,675
It's a very small signal.

216
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,543
We'd have to measure it
from space.

217
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,946
And what we learn if we
were looking at the Sun is,

218
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,547
we could, you know,
learn that the planet

219
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,949
was about the size of the Earth.

220
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,183
We maybe could get a mass

221
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,785
by looking at the motion
of the Sun,

222
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,387
so we knew it was the mass
and the radius of the Earth,

223
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,990
and we know how far away it is

224
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,926
using things like Kepler's laws
and the orbital period.

225
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,528
But the important thing is,

226
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,763
if we were doing this
on the solar system,

227
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,632
we wouldn't just get
one planet like the Earth.

228
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,634
We'd get two, right?

229
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,236
If we were looking
at the solar system

230
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,105
with our current technology,

231
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,075
we would say the solar system
has two habitable planets

232
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,477
because we have the Earth
and we also have Venus,

233
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,313
and Venus is nearly the same
mass and radius as the Earth,

234
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,217
and it's closer to the Sun,
but it's not that much closer,

235
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,586
and the theory we have
about habitability

236
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,523
says that Venus
probably should be habitable.

237
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,124
There's a lot of other factors,
of course,

238
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,759
that have made Venus
not habitable,

239
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,028
but we don't fully
understand them yet, right?

240
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,963
So one of the tasks
that we have,

241
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,133
and this is what I do,
is trying to figure out, right,

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,204
if we have a planet like this,
how do we determine

243
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:40,874
if it's like the Earth--
that is, a nice beach vacation--

244
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:45,512
or if it's like Venus and it's
gonna melt your spacecraft

245
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,981
30 minutes
after you land, right?

246
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,283
This is actually true.

247
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,285
The only landers that we have
that have ever reached

248
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,354
the surface of Venus
are a couple of Soviet landers

249
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,190
that landed in the 1980s,

250
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,724
and they only lasted
on the surface

251
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,028
for about 30 minutes
before they got squished

252
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,730
by some combination
of crushed by the pressure

253
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,732
and dissolved
by the sulfuric acid

254
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,602
that's present
in Venus's atmosphere.

255
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,838
And actually,
a really fun story is,

256
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,439
we don't actually have
a very good measurement.

257
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,241
This isn't that funny,
this isn't that fun a--

258
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,442
It's a fun story for us.

259
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,579
It's not a fun story
for the scientists involved.

260
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,314
So we don't really have
a good measurement

261
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,249
of the surface of Venus,

262
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,452
like, what the, like, dirt is
in that picture,

263
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,421
because one of the--

264
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,624
So the first Soviet lander
that landed on Venus,

265
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,393
that had a camera, but
the lens cap didn't come off,

266
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,963
so they didn't get any pictures,
and so they said,

267
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,498
"Okay, for the next one,
we're definitely making sure

268
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,834
the lens cap is coming off,"
right, and it did.

269
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,536
This is where this picture
comes from, right,

270
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:45,506
so the lens cap comes off
as it's drifting down,

271
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,441
and we get these nice pictures.

272
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:49,243
But one of the next
experiments they had--

273
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,245
and, remember, they only have
about 30 minutes, and then

274
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,748
the whole thing is done because
the spacecraft has melted.

275
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,750
One of the experiments
they were gonna do was,

276
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,686
there was a spring-loaded arm
inside the spacecraft

277
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,889
that was gonna,
you know, a catch-release.

278
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,825
As the spring shoots the arm
out, it goes into the dirt,

279
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,227
and then they retract it back,
and they can get some dirt,

280
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,931
and they can analyze it,
but it's a one-shot thing.

281
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,133
You can't retract the spring,

282
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,035
you know,
once it's fired, right?

283
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,004
You fire it, you're done.

284
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,173
And so they're down,
they're all ready,

285
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,340
they've released the spring.

286
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,842
The arm shoots out,
and it shoots

287
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,912
directly into the lens cap that,

288
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,948
even though it popped off
about 500 feet up in the air,

289
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,083
has landed directly
next to the spacecraft

290
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,320
and directly where this arm
was about to shoot out into,

291
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,756
and so that is why
we don't actually have

292
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:40,694
a good measurement
of what Venus's surface is like.

293
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,996
But okay, so we can't do that
with exoplanets, right?

294
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,164
We can't go there.

295
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,900
We can't try and dodge
lens cap covers

296
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,435
to measure what
these planets are like.

297
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,205
We can't even see them
most of the time, right,

298
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,073
so we need to come up
with other ways

299
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,609
of figuring out
what they're like.

300
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,811
And so the main way
in which we do this is,

301
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,013
we look at their atmospheres
by watching

302
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,316
as transiting exoplanets--

303
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,419
Those are the exoplanets that
pass in front of their stars.

304
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,421
As they pass in front
of their star,

305
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,856
some of that light,

306
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,858
some of that starlight that's
getting blocked by the planet,

307
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,459
it isn't entirely blocked,
right?

308
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,894
It filters through the
outer edges

309
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,829
of the planetary atmosphere,

310
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:19,366
and that outer edges
imprints on that starlight.

311
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,101
The starlight keeps coming
to us on Earth

312
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,570
from the outer edges of the
atmosphere imprint on it,

313
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,771
and that is what allows us

314
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,074
to measure the atmospheric
composition

315
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,242
of these planets, right?

316
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,443
We never actually see
the planet.

317
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,612
We just see it pass
in front of the star,

318
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,248
but because of that
little fringe of atmosphere,

319
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,384
we can measure what's going on
in the exoplanet atmosphere.

320
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:42,055
And this was first done
about just under 20 years ago

321
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,459
for a planet called
HD 219--209458.

322
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:52,499
Most planet names
are complete telephone numbers.

323
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:53,901
They're named
after star catalog names.

324
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,903
Like I said, you never
get to name an exoplanet

325
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,204
after yourself.

326
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,641
You get to name it after
the star catalog that it's in.

327
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,042
But if you do this long enough,

328
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,844
you get to remember
the telephone numbers, as well,

329
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,513
so it was first done
on a planet called HD 209458,

330
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,948
it's well-known
in the community,

331
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,384
and now we've done it
for a whole bunch of exoplanets

332
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,556
using telescopes like Hubble
and things from the ground.

333
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,958
But the really exciting thing
is to do this

334
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,693
with the James Webb
Space Telescope,

335
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,695
and this is the new telescope
that was just launched

336
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,565
two years ago, and is really--

337
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,434
You know, saying it's
gonna usher in a new era

338
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,003
of, you know,
exoplanet atmosphere studies

339
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,105
is probably understating
what's about to happen

340
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,308
over the next couple of years.

341
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,946
So launch for James Webb
was Christmas Day of 2020

342
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,982
from French Guiana.

343
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,152
As was mentioned
in the introduction,

344
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,554
I worked on one
of the Webb instrument teams,

345
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,890
one of the JWST
instrument teams,

346
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,759
specifically
on a camera called NIRCam.

347
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,696
That's one of the 4 instruments
on the spacecraft,

348
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:59,366
and so all of us were online
to watch the launch.

349
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,369
Actually, what happened is,
I was at my in-laws in Chicago,

350
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:03,570
and I have two young children,

351
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:07,341
and so we did presents
for about an hour,

352
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,610
and then launch was at 6:15,

353
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,479
so we woke up at 5:00 A.M.,
did presents for about an hour,

354
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:16,617
and then we all went
and watched the launch for--

355
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:20,120
you know, in the middle
of Christmas morning.

356
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,989
And I will tell you,

357
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,126
my mother-in-law,
who's very nice,

358
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,862
she's a wonderful woman,
and you guys would love her,

359
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,267
but she also, you know,
she thought, she understood

360
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,637
how important this was to me
professionally, right?

361
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,906
Like, if this exploded
on launch,

362
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,009
it was unclear I was gonna
have a job the next day, right?

363
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,144
There was a lot riding on this,

364
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,880
but also her
conception of this was,

365
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,217
if the rocket ignited and we
were going, we were done, right?

366
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,252
And in reality, you know,

367
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,755
the rocket can blow up
at any time, right?

368
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:58,659
And once you get off-- actually,
the real sticking point

369
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,495
was as soon as JWST came
off the top of the rocket,

370
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,530
it was on battery power,

371
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,866
and the batteries last
for about 20 minutes,

372
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,968
and so it has to deploy
a solar panel

373
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,537
and start generating electricity
as soon as it can,

374
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,172
and if that solar panel
didn't deploy,

375
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,374
you had 20 minutes
to figure out what was going on,

376
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,576
and then you were done, right?

377
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,110
There was no way to recover it.

378
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,746
And one of the best things
I ever saw in my life was,

379
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,216
there's video feed
from the launch

380
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,519
of, you know, Webb detaching
from the upper stage,

381
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,621
and you could immediately see
the solar panel coming out,

382
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,223
and we were all
on the internal comms,

383
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,490
and you could
hear them reporting

384
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,192
that power was starting
to be generated,

385
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,094
and everybody started cheering
because we knew that,

386
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,363
you know,
the first hurdle was overcome.

387
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,031
But my mother-in-law,
who's a wonderful woman,

388
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,934
thought as we were, like,
30 seconds in and the rocket

389
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,769
was firing that, you know,
everything was great,

390
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,838
and so we're 30 seconds in
and the rocket's firing,

391
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,240
and she comes over,
and she's like,

392
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,407
"Thomas, you did it.

393
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:50,310
Like, it's all happening,
congratulations,"

394
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,646
and I just was like,
"Not now, Cindy."

395
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,715
[audience laughing]

396
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,484
But she's very nice.

397
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,454
So there's a couple
of exciting things about Webb.

398
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,257
One of them-- and this
still boggles my mind,

399
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,727
even having known this
for, you know, years, right--

400
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:11,098
is that Webb is about
three times as large as Hubble,

401
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,767
but the mirror
weighs half as much, right?

402
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,370
And the collecting area
you get from a mirror

403
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,472
is the area, right,
so if it's three times larger,

404
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,241
that means you get
almost 10 times as much light

405
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,676
in the same amount of time,

406
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,811
so it's about 10 times
more powerful than Hubble.

407
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,979
It weighs half as much.

408
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,581
It's really
an incredible machine,

409
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,518
and the amount of attention
to detail and design

410
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,987
that went into it
really just boggles the mind.

411
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,622
The other difference
from Hubble is that Webb

412
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,191
is an infrared telescope.

413
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:41,161
So Hubble observes
a little bit into the infrared,

414
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,163
but fundamentally
is an optical telescope,

415
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,998
but observed very close
to the wavelengths--

416
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,201
to the kind of light
that we see with our eyes.

417
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,635
And Webb's observes
very different wavelengths

418
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,638
and longer wavelengths,
the infrared, you know,

419
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:56,510
closer to the heat
that you see in images of heat.

420
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,012
So one thing this allows us
to do is it allows us

421
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,282
to probe deeper into
the atmospheres of exoplanets.

422
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,651
So this is a picture of Jupiter
taken in the infrared.

423
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,754
You can see the sort of bands
and clouds where, you know,

424
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,491
you maybe are used to seeing
in optical images of Jupiter.

425
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,228
Here's the Great Red Spot,
just for reference, right,

426
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,263
that sort of dark,
circle-ish thing.

427
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,365
The bright parts here

428
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,934
are really hot parts
of Jupiter, right?

429
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,703
What that means is,
those bright parts are

430
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,371
you are seeing
through the clouds

431
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,107
into the interior of the planet,
where it is hotter.

432
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,976
So the darker parts
are the upper clouds

433
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,378
that usually that's what we see
when we look in visible light

434
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,080
and hotter and deeper,

435
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,115
we can actually see
with these infrared images,

436
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,251
and we usually can't see that
in the optical.

437
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,453
We also see different molecules
in the infrared.

438
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,054
We get to see a lot of methane.

439
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:45,058
We get to see a lot of ozone
and water and carbon dioxide,

440
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,060
which we couldn't really
see easily,

441
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,663
particularly in
exoplanet observations.

442
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,999
As a little bit of color,

443
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,035
so launch for Webb
was Christmas morning,

444
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,137
and then we all spent

445
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:01,108
the next six months traveling
out to Baltimore one week--

446
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:04,478
a little over a week a month
for six months straight

447
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,613
to operate the telescope
during commissioning,

448
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,915
because it launches

449
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,117
and then it needs to be
checked out before NASA will,

450
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,252
you know, accept it
as an operating observatory.

451
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,054
So, as some local color,

452
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,056
here's what my office
looked like

453
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:19,193
for most of those six months
during commissioning,

454
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,761
helping to run the telescope.

455
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,429
The really helpful thing, right,

456
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,798
is that most of this
is color-coded, right?

457
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,201
It turns out that there
are actually very few people

458
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,369
that know what
all those numbers mean,

459
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,537
right, not even me.

460
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,639
I knew my part,
but most of these,

461
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,976
what was happening, like,
other people understood.

462
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,478
It was sort of a fascinating
project that no one person

463
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,247
can really hold it all
in their head,

464
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,115
except there was one guy, right?

465
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,018
The real job that we all had
was to look at these screens

466
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:49,122
and if anything turned red, we
were gonna call Carl, right,

467
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,659
'cause Carl knows
what all these numbers mean

468
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,295
and knows if they turn red,
what to do about it,

469
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:59,166
or at least he knows
who to talk to, right?

470
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,236
I'll also say that we--

471
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,238
most of the shifts,
they were eight-hour shifts,

472
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,939
and we were there
most of the day.

473
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,274
We did have to observe.

474
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,076
We had to be there overnight
some weeks,

475
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,578
which I felt was particularly
unjust for a space telescope

476
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,181
where you don't actually
usually have to be up overnight.

477
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,816
The one nice thing is,

478
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:19,653
we actually ended up watching
a fair amount of movies,

479
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,356
and this is a photograph of--

480
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,791
So we were all
in a room called Science--

481
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,995
the Science Instrument Room,
the SI Room,

482
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,796
and right next to us
in a separate room

483
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,598
was Flight Operations,
Flight Ops.

484
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,568
This is a photograph
of all the Flight Ops desks.

485
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,236
They were the people
who actually sent commands

486
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,105
to the spacecraft.

487
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:42,776
And you will notice,
if you look very carefully,

488
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,945
right up here at that image,

489
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:49,316
Flight Ops is currently
watching Olympic curling

490
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:52,286
on the big screens
at the front of the room, right?

491
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,888
So most of the movies
we watched were actually stuff

492
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:56,557
that Flight Ops set up
and put on,

493
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,825
and they also get
to choose the movies,

494
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,228
and they had a very
interesting--

495
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,597
I really wanna know
who was in charge of this

496
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,199
'cause we spent
about a week working through

497
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,634
all the <i>Princess Diaries</i>
movies.

498
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,504
Then we did really trashy
sci-fi movies.

499
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,906
Have you guys ever seen
<i>Moonfall?</i>

500
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,475
Like, the moon comes alive
and crashes into the Earth.

501
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,678
Yeah, that's what we watched.

502
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,380
It was not what
I would have expected

503
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:25,052
for a bunch of NASA engineers
in the other room.

504
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,322
Okay, so that's a little bit
of color from commissioning,

505
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,658
but to get back to the serious
part of the talk, right,

506
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,661
how can we use JWST
to search for life, right?

507
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,431
Now that we have this machine,
this observatory in space,

508
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:41,768
we want to use it to search
for life with its giant mirror.

509
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,504
How do we do that?

510
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,006
So one thing is that often

511
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,876
when we think about other life
in the universe, right,

512
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,813
a lot of what we think about is
other intelligent life, right?

513
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,649
Like, we're thinking about
some sort of, like,

514
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,685
face-sucking alien that's gonna,
like, read your mind

515
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,523
or, like, you know, the alien
from <i>Aliens,</i> right?

516
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:06,026
But there's other kinds of life
out in the universe, right?

517
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,495
And when we're talking about
in the astronomical context

518
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:11,698
searching for life, we're not
just meaning intelligent life.

519
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:15,102
We also mean plants and bacteria
and animals and, really,

520
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,405
any kind of life,
any kind of life out there

521
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:22,476
that would be something
like life on Earth.

522
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,379
So what that means is that
a lot of people

523
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,481
spend a lot of time
thinking about

524
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,050
what, exactly,
do we mean by life, right?

525
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,785
Like, what does that
actually mean?

526
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,453
Like, what is that?

527
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,656
And I'll say it's a topic
of a lot of debate.

528
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,491
I've gone to a lot
of conferences where people

529
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:40,294
spend a lot of time discussing
exactly what it means.

530
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,197
My personal favorite
definition--

531
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:44,798
Well, I've written it
on the slide, right?

532
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:45,966
It's, life is some sort

533
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,635
of self-organized
chemical structure

534
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:52,139
that alters its environment
and can reproduce.

535
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,307
To me, that seems like

536
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,043
a pretty general,
basic statement

537
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,744
that tries to be pretty agnostic

538
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,847
about what, exactly, life is,
right?

539
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,448
So we're not just looking
for intelligent life.

540
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:05,385
We're looking for just life as
a general category of objects.

541
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:08,121
On Earth, all of the life
on Earth

542
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:11,859
is based fundamentally
around DNA, right,

543
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:16,363
which is some assembly
of hydrogen, oxygen,

544
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,899
nitrogen, carbon,
and phosphorus, right?

545
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:22,302
The backbone of most of these
molecules are carbon molecules.

546
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,972
That's why we say that
life on Earth is carbon-based.

547
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:27,307
It's why organic chemistry
exists as a subfield.

548
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,877
Organic chemistry
is just carbon molecules

549
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:32,946
and carbon chemistry, right,
because it's a fundamental part

550
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:36,917
of all of our lives
of everything on Earth.

551
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:41,021
And life on Earth also requires
liquid water, right?

552
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,657
The reason for that is that
all the chemical reactions

553
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:47,127
that happen in your body need
some sort of liquid suspension

554
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,962
for it to occur in, right?

555
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,631
It's hard to get
chemistry to happen

556
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,099
just dry on the floor.

557
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,768
We need some liquid
to allow things to mix,

558
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:57,137
and you can dissolve a lot
of things in water, right?

559
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:59,640
Water is sometimes referred to
as the universal solvent.

560
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,875
So life on Earth,
we need liquid water.

561
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,244
We need a lot of carbon,
oxygen, nitrogen,

562
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:06,547
maybe a little bit
of phosphorus.

563
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,982
Okay, so what about life
on other planets, right?

564
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,984
If we think about what
life looks like on Earth,

565
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:13,187
then what does that tell us
about where do we look

566
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,255
for life on other planets?

567
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:18,725
Well, first thing is,
we need an ocean, right?

568
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,527
If we want to find life
like the Earth,

569
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,230
we need to have liquid water
present on the surface,

570
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,232
enough liquid water for it
to be a fundamental part

571
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:28,402
of the biology,
just like it is for us.

572
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,138
It's actually
an interesting point

573
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,773
about the Earth's oceans, right?

574
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,175
And it's actually a very fine
point that a lot of people

575
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,678
are thinking about as we think
about oceans on other worlds.

576
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,479
'Cause if you think about it,
if Earth had

577
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,149
a little bit more water,
just a little bit more water,

578
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:44,651
the surface would be entirely
covered by ocean, right?

579
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:45,819
There'd be no land.

580
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,621
It would just be water
all the way down.

581
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,189
Well, until you hit
the sea floor.

582
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:50,991
And if we had
a little bit less water,

583
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:52,259
there wouldn't be any oceans.

584
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,161
We'd be something like Mars,
where there is water,

585
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:55,829
but it's frozen
into the polar icecaps,

586
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,397
or it's in ice underground.

587
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,900
It's not just standing water
on the surface.

588
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,903
So Earth, at least right now,
seems to be

589
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,206
a pretty finely balanced
midpoint

590
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,909
between those two extremes,
and it seems very convenient

591
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,711
that we happen to live
on the one planet

592
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:14,181
that just happens to hit
that exact point.

593
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:15,983
Now, maybe that's reading
too much into it, right?

594
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,150
We only have one example.

595
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,352
Maybe we're gonna go out there,

596
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:19,953
and we're gonna discover
tons of ocean worlds,

597
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,955
and it's gonna be great,
or maybe we're gonna discover

598
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,424
tons of life that lives on ice
and melts it--

599
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,360
or I don't know what, right?

600
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:28,028
But just something
to think about.

601
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,830
But the fact that we have
oceans on Earth

602
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:35,335
is actually very coincidental,
seems to be very finely tuned.

603
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:36,837
Another thing we also need is,

604
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,972
we need the right temperature,
right?

605
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,374
We need
the right amount of water.

606
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,642
We need the right temperature,
right?

607
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,044
If Earth gets too hot,
if it moves in a little bit

608
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,480
closer to the Sun, all the water
boils off into steam.

609
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,782
If it moves too far out,
it all freezes,

610
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:52,186
it turns into ice,
and we're a giant snowball.

611
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:54,188
So one of the fundamental
things we wanna look for

612
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:57,124
when we're looking for
potentially habitable planets

613
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,325
is we wanna look for planets

614
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,561
that are at the right distance
from their stars,

615
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:03,363
that are in the habitable zone,
or the Goldilocks zone,

616
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,200
the right temperature
so that liquid water can exist

617
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:09,203
on the surface of these planets.

618
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,438
And we actually have
a bunch of these, right?

619
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,807
These are actual real planets.

620
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,309
The images are not real, right?

621
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,977
These are all artists'
conceptions,

622
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:20,447
but these are all actual planets
that we have detected

623
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:23,050
and are about the size
of the Earth

624
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:25,018
and are at the right distance
from their stars

625
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,955
to support liquid water
on their surfaces, right?

626
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,423
We actually know
about a whole bunch

627
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,258
of potentially habitable planets
that we could go

628
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,594
and search for life on them.

629
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,829
So, okay, so we've detected
a whole bunch of planets.

630
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,231
We have this nice
light curve, right?

631
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:38,565
What happens next?

632
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:40,767
How do we figure out
if we have a beach vacation

633
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,303
or if we have Venus, right?

634
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,439
Now that we know
these planets are out there,

635
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:47,107
how do we look
at their atmospheres

636
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:50,310
and figure out if they
actually might have life?

637
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:52,479
Well, we primarily wanna look
for three things

638
00:26:52,546 --> 00:26:53,647
in the atmosphere.

639
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:56,783
So first, we wanna
look for water, right?

640
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,318
We wanna confirm that there's

641
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,820
some sort of water
in the system.

642
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:01,488
Well, it's the right temperature
for liquid water,

643
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:06,326
but we don't know if liquid
water is there until we see it.

644
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,595
We also want to look
for oxygen, right?

645
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:10,797
20% of the air you're breathing
right now is oxygen.

646
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:13,534
It's a major component
of our atmosphere on Earth.

647
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,935
And we also wanna look
for methane,

648
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,604
but probably not
too much, right?

649
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:22,209
It's one of the major biological
products from life on Earth.

650
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,711
The main biosignature, right,

651
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:27,981
thing you would want to look for
in an atmosphere, is oxygen.

652
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,518
It's often considered
a primary biosignature,

653
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:36,590
and the reason for that is that
without life on Earth,

654
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,458
the level of oxygen in our air

655
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,894
would be about a million times
lower, right?

656
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:42,262
So when the Earth first formed,

657
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,566
there was almost zero oxygen
in the atmosphere of the planet,

658
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:48,569
and the only reason why the air
you are breathing right now

659
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:51,939
is 20% oxygen
is because life evolved

660
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:56,810
and started photosynthesizing,
so the fact that 1/5 of our air

661
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:59,379
is composed out of oxygen
molecules is solely due

662
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:00,547
to life on Earth.

663
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:01,748
If all the life on Earth

664
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,383
suddenly blinked out
of existence tomorrow,

665
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,185
all the oxygen would be gone
from our atmosphere

666
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:07,754
within probably
a couple thousand years,

667
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:10,123
very quick
on an astronomical time scale.

668
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,993
So if we were looking
at an exoplanet

669
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,761
and we saw some water
in the atmosphere

670
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,496
and we saw oxygen,

671
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,300
I mean, there's probably
a couple more steps,

672
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,002
but you could probably
think about writing

673
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:25,239
your Nobel Prize acceptance
speech at that point, right?

674
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:28,575
It's a really strong signal
that we've got

675
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:31,345
a good, promising candidate.

676
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,146
One of the best candidates
to look for this,

677
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,749
a lot of people are spending
a lot of time looking at this,

678
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,051
is a system called TRAPPIST-1.

679
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,620
These are a whole bunch
of planets,

680
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:42,155
and a bunch of them
are in the habitable zone,

681
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,790
so it's a very small star.

682
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:44,958
They're all very close in,

683
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:47,160
but they're all
in the habitable zone.

684
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:51,598
Two of these have already
been looked at with James Webb.

685
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:54,034
I was actually involved
with looking at--

686
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:58,272
the team that looked at
the innermost one, TRAPPIST-1b,

687
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:01,341
where we measured what it
looked like for the first time,

688
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,177
and, unfortunately,
the answer was,

689
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,846
it looks like
a bare rock in space,

690
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,448
that the atmosphere has been
completely blasted off.

691
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:11,785
I was actually sitting with the
guy who was analyzing the data.

692
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:13,520
The whole observation
was designed to take,

693
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,155
like, five separate transits,

694
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:17,257
and we were gonna have
to add them all together

695
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:19,893
before we thought we were
gonna get anything,

696
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,095
and I was sitting next to him
when he first downloaded

697
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,565
the first data from the
first observation,

698
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:28,268
and you could just see it,
like, in the first one.

699
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,270
And we both looked
at each other, and we're like,

700
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:33,607
"Well, that is not
really the answer we wanted,"

701
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,709
because it means
it was a very hot rock,

702
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,711
the fact that we could see it
the first time.

703
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,814
So actually, it's telling us
a lot about how planets

704
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:43,984
lose atmospheres if they're
very close to their stars,

705
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,219
and then the second one,

706
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,888
TRAPPIST-1c, is
more Venus-like, it turns out,

707
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,724
from other Webb observations,

708
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:54,761
but there are a lot of people
looking at E and F and G to try

709
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:58,398
and get much finer observations
of their atmospheres.

710
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,701
So there's a lot of people
looking for Earth-like life.

711
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,036
Another thing we can do
is look for life,

712
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:05,205
but maybe not
quite as we know it, right,

713
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,673
not quite like the Earth.

714
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,075
And so I mentioned
that the Earth--

715
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,476
We seem to be very finely tuned

716
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:11,845
in terms of having
land and an ocean, right?

717
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:14,581
What if we looked not
at planets like the Earth,

718
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,416
but what if we looked
at water worlds,

719
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,051
giant water worlds

720
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:22,556
that are somewhere in between
the Earth and Neptune?

721
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:25,392
So these are called
hycean planets.

722
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,194
This was sort of
a category of planets

723
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,563
that was suggested
a couple of years ago,

724
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,965
and the idea is that it's
not a planet like the Earth.

725
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:34,067
It's probably about
five or even ten times

726
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,669
more massive than the Earth,

727
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:38,172
much larger,
but there's a lot of water,

728
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,540
and there's a hydrogen envelope,

729
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:41,742
a hydrogen atmosphere
that insulates that water,

730
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,744
and so you can have
a liquid water ocean

731
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,346
at the right temperature,
at about room temperature,

732
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,415
and you could
maybe have volcanism

733
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:49,883
or something going on
underneath,

734
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,685
and so you could have
a liquid water ocean

735
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,687
at the right temperature
with energy being put into it,

736
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:58,859
and you could have life present
on these planets, right?

737
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:00,727
That wouldn't be life
like the Earth.

738
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,596
It may not
even be intelligent life,

739
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:04,064
but it would be life, right,

740
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:05,799
and that would be
very exciting to find,

741
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,801
and these are
much bigger planets,

742
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:13,340
and so they're much easier to
measure the atmospheres for.

743
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:18,879
And so actually,
at University of Wisconsin,

744
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:22,082
we actually have time
on a telescope out in Arizona.

745
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:25,752
We get about 20 nights a year
on the WIYN telescope,

746
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,888
and one of the things
that I do is

747
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:32,860
I use some of that time
to look for planets like these,

748
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:36,230
and I actually have a student
working with me right now

749
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,865
who's working on this.

750
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:39,600
He's actually--

751
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,936
Pretty excitingly, he's actually
found two of these this spring

752
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:46,573
where we're starting to write up
that paper right now, right?

753
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,143
Two new planets in this category
that this fall,

754
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,745
we're gonna apply
for James Webb time

755
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,948
to try and look at what
the atmospheres are like, right?

756
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,683
We're actually--

757
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,819
Well, Arizona
is two hours behind us,

758
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:00,921
so they're probably opening up

759
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,322
probably in about
an hour from now

760
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:03,924
to start observing tonight,
and they're gonna be

761
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,560
observing again for us tonight,
as well, right?

762
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,730
So we're actually
doing this search tonight

763
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:12,733
to look for planets like these.

764
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,068
And the exciting thing is,

765
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:18,338
is that, because
these are so large,

766
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:19,907
they're actually pretty--

767
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,542
the atmospheres
are pretty detectable

768
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,310
with James Webb observations,

769
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:26,813
so JWST in one to four
transit observations,

770
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,250
which is a pretty reasonable
request to ask for time

771
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,986
on the telescope,
could look at these planets

772
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:36,156
and could detect
signatures of life

773
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,692
in the atmosphere, right?

774
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:43,397
And this is actually something
that's happening, right?

775
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,867
These two have
both been observed, right?

776
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,770
This one, the results
were announced last fall.

777
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:52,005
This one, the results were
announced last spring.

778
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:53,807
Top one hasn't
been looked at yet,

779
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,742
but there's a lot of people
putting in proposals.

780
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,578
We're putting in proposals

781
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,413
and getting time
to look at these planets,

782
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,048
and we're finding new ones

783
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:03,217
to try and find life
on these planets,

784
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:07,354
and we think we have a pretty
good shot if it's there.

785
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:09,723
The really fun part
is gonna be

786
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,793
once we get something
that we think might be life

787
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,397
because I've been describing
to you how we need to understand

788
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:18,966
the biosignatures
in the atmosphere:

789
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,367
We need to look for water;

790
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:23,437
we need to look for oxygen,
maybe a little bit of methane--

791
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:27,307
and what's gonna happen
if we do this successfully is,

792
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,475
we're gonna get something

793
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,877
that looks like an atmosphere
like Earth,

794
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:32,679
and then we're gonna have
to figure out if all those gases

795
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:34,114
and things we see
in the atmosphere

796
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,149
are produced by life
or if they're produced

797
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:39,253
by things like volcanoes
or geologic processes.

798
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,489
And figuring that out is gonna
require not just astronomers

799
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,925
and people who know
how to operate JWST

800
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:47,327
and know how to measure
exoplanet atmospheres.

801
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:49,096
We're gonna need
planetary scientists.

802
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:52,065
We're gonna need geologists,
biologists,

803
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,801
ocean scientists,
everybody, right?

804
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,604
All these other bits
of the puzzle that we all need

805
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:00,641
to get together and figure out
what's going on,

806
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,210
and that's the idea
behind this thing

807
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:06,480
called the Wisconsin Center
for Origins Research, WiCOR,

808
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:10,350
that is, hopefully,
starting this fall.

809
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,619
We're provisionally starting--

810
00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:14,254
We're provisionally
a center right now,

811
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,123
but we're hopefully
officially gonna be a center

812
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,059
this coming fall
that is specifically designed

813
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:21,495
to do just that, to get all
these different people together

814
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,598
from all these different
departments at UW-Madison

815
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:26,800
to start talking and figure out

816
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,535
how can we plan
for detecting life

817
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:30,604
and how can we design
observations

818
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:31,772
that are gonna do it?

819
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,140
And once we've done it,

820
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,642
how do we prove that it's life
in a way that's convincing

821
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,611
to the rest
of the scientific community?

822
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:40,347
And it's a project that's
gonna be extremely difficult,

823
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,983
and it's gonna require
a lot of different people

824
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,819
all working together, sharing
their own specialized knowledge,

825
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,355
but we think it can be done.

826
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,591
Okay.

827
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:53,660
I like this flowchart.

828
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:58,298
Usually, actually, when I show
this slide,

829
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:00,133
I don't really
have much to say here.

830
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,568
I just sort of like the way

831
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:04,438
it schematically lays out
what's going on.

832
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:07,140
It actually reflects a lot
of my thinking on this as well.

833
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:10,077
I will say, my particular
favorite is that

834
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:11,478
the successful detection of life

835
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:14,448
is just labeled by "champagne,"
right?

836
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:17,117
Right, this is the basic outline
of what we need to do.

837
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,819
We need to find planets.

838
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,821
We need to figure out
if they're like the Earth.

839
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:23,223
We need to run through a bunch
of tests in the atmosphere

840
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,626
to see what's in it,
and at the end of the day,

841
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:28,128
hopefully, we'll work our way
down to champagne

842
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,797
and then have to start talking
to the geologists

843
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,332
and the oceanography people

844
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:36,403
to figure out if this
is actually feasible.

845
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:43,277
Okay, so I'm gonna end
with this picture again, right?

846
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:47,114
So, as I mentioned
at the start of the talk,

847
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:50,117
you know, people
have been thinking about

848
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:52,152
is there life elsewhere
in the universe, right?

849
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:55,088
The question "Is there a planet
like the Earth somewhere else?"

850
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:58,659
for at least 2,500 years, right,
over 2,000 years,

851
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,661
probably more than that, right?

852
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,196
That's a pretty--

853
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:03,697
I can imagine somebody
asked that question

854
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:05,666
a very long time ago.

855
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,968
And even in the
astronomical community,

856
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:11,171
in exoplanets, people have spent
the last three decades,

857
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,840
even since we knew
about exoplanets,

858
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:14,908
looking for planets
like the Earth,

859
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:17,978
and we're starting
to find them.

860
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:21,849
And one of the big revolutions
in astronomy is,

861
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:24,151
the search for biosignatures
and the search for life

862
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,054
has progressed from something
that, you know,

863
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,890
nobody really takes seriously
to something that

864
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:33,560
a lot of people are trying
very hard to do successfully,

865
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:37,097
and it's an incredibly
exciting time

866
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,499
to be a part of astronomy,
right,

867
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:42,503
'cause, like, the stuff
that we are doing at UW,

868
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,238
you know, we're
assembling this team

869
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:46,173
that's gonna
hopefully do this.

870
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,009
We're observing tonight,
like I said, to try and find

871
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,812
new planets that we can look at
with instruments

872
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:55,215
like the James Webb to try
and find life elsewhere.

873
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,783
Like, the hunt is on,

874
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,152
and it's happening now
as we speak, right?

875
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,621
Like, people are doing it.

876
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:03,423
This isn't some future thing
maybe in a couple of years,

877
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,759
we could think about, you know,

878
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:07,327
looking for life
on other planets.

879
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,897
People are actively
searching right now,

880
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:11,398
and if it's out there

881
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,901
and if it's on some of these
big, sort of, hycean planets,

882
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,103
I think we have
a pretty good shot of doing it

883
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,337
in the next 10 years.

884
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:21,542
Probably earlier than that--
by 2030, I bet, right?

885
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:24,611
That means that we are
right on the edge of answering

886
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:29,183
a question that people
have thought of for 2,500 years

887
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,351
and wondered
about the answer for.

888
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,620
And so it's a very exciting
time to be in astronomy,

889
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:35,822
and it's a very exciting time
to think about finally knowing

890
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:38,358
the answer to that question
after over two millennia

891
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:41,528
of people wondering about it,
and it's, you know,

892
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:45,065
it's why I get excited about
going in to work in the morning.

893
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,000
It's also why I like
giving these talks, right,

894
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:49,670
to tell you guys about that
and hopefully get you excited

895
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:54,474
about how really close we are
to actually doing this.

896
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:58,478
You know, I said it's gonna be
very hard, right?

897
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:00,881
It's very difficult
observations.

898
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:03,083
It's a very complicated
analysis problem,

899
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,686
and it's gonna be
a pretty subtle chain of logic

900
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:07,788
that's gonna get us there,

901
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,656
but, you know,
I think it's gonna be

902
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:14,528
probably one of the most
complicated and difficult

903
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,433
but probably greatest,
you know, scientific endeavor

904
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:23,537
that astronomy has done for
the last couple hundred years.

905
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,906
So, hopefully,
we're gonna get to champagne

906
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:28,775
in the next couple of years,
and if we do, I will come back

907
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:32,446
and tell you guys all about it
in another Badger Talk.

908
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:34,848
So thank you,
and I'll take questions.

909
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:37,184
[audience applauding]

910
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,624
Uh, yeah?

911
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,360
- Audience Member 1: Is it
possible that some of the moons,

912
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:50,597
both within our solar system
and outside, could contain life?

913
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,799
- Right, so is it possible
that some of the moons

914
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,935
in our solar system or outside
could contain life?

915
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:59,473
Yes, and, actually,
the planetary science community

916
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,476
is very excited about going out

917
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:05,479
to the moons of Jupiter
and Saturn, as well.

918
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:08,882
So there's one mission
called Europa Clipper

919
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,518
that is launching in six months
that's gonna travel

920
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:13,887
to Jupiter's moon Europa,
and Europa is very exciting

921
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:18,358
'cause it's covered
in a surface of ice, right?

922
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:21,962
It's cold enough that ice
on Europa is like rock on Earth,

923
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,364
so the surface is solid ice,
solid water,

924
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,466
and then the mantle,
what we have for lava,

925
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,136
is just liquid water,
so it's liquid water ocean,

926
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,305
and there seems to be
volcanoes underneath.

927
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,675
We know that 'cause we can see
ice volcanoes on the surface,

928
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:36,577
so it seems like
it's a liquid water ocean

929
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:39,713
and there's volcanoes
adding energy into that system,

930
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,216
and so it's very possible
there's life there,

931
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,484
and so there's Europa,
there's Enceladus,

932
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,620
which is around Saturn,
is another exciting one,

933
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,856
and Titan around Saturn
is in many ways

934
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,791
actually pretty similar
to early Earth

935
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:53,827
before life evolved,
or Archean Earth, actually.

936
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:55,796
That's very early life on Earth,

937
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:58,031
when we had a lot of methane
in our atmosphere,

938
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:01,735
and so all three of those,
people are spending

939
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:03,904
a lot of time thinking about
and developing missions for

940
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,973
to try and find life,

941
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,976
and people have been
searching for moons

942
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:11,745
outside the solar system,
moons around exoplanets,

943
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:14,081
and there's been a couple
of tentative detections,

944
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,582
but nothing quite yet.

945
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:17,184
But people are thinking
about that as well.

946
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,753
So, yeah, moons in the
solar system, people are--

947
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,755
the planetary science community
is thinking about that a lot

948
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:23,557
and actually getting
stuff out there

949
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:26,360
'cause Europa Clipper
will launch soon.

950
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:27,861
Uh, yeah?

951
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,364
- Audience Member 2: What future
telescopes are being planned

952
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,299
that you can get
a closer look at these?

953
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,434
Is there any
in the works right now?

954
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:37,137
- Yeah, so what future
telescopes are being planned?

955
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:40,741
So the next big NASA
telescope mission

956
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:42,776
will be something called Roman,

957
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,612
which is launching
in '26 currently.

958
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,851
That's more of a exoplanet
detection and population survey

959
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:52,719
than a characterization mission.

960
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,589
Probably, there are a couple
of other missions

961
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:57,090
that are gonna launch
that will do

962
00:40:57,157 --> 00:41:00,427
exoplanet atmospheric
characterization,

963
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:03,897
but they're not gonna greatly
exceed JWST's capability.

964
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,066
The next big thing that
everybody is thinking about

965
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,868
is a mission that
right now is called

966
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:12,606
the Habitable Worlds Observatory
that, you know,

967
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:17,511
is currently scheduled
for 2035 for launch,

968
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:19,913
but put your own handicap
on that.

969
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,549
It's probably later than that,
but that is the idea.

970
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,118
We're gonna put a very large,
you know, eight-meter mirror

971
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:27,521
in space, and that will be,
in principle, able

972
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:29,489
to directly image planets
like the Earth

973
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:32,492
and actually measure
the atmospheres directly.

974
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,294
We don't need to do it
indirectly by waiting

975
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:37,130
for planets to pass
in front of a star.

976
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:40,567
So Habitable Worlds Observatory,
HabWorlds,

977
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,803
if it launches,
should be able to do this.

978
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,471
But that's another
good point, right?

979
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:46,406
HabWorlds, like, is just--

980
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:48,976
It's just an engineering problem
right now, right?

981
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,512
It's an engineering, and it's
a "convince the Congress

982
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:54,581
to give NASA enough money
to build it" problem, right?

983
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:57,417
We could do this very quickly
if we wanted to.

984
00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:59,620
It's just, we need to do
a couple of engineering checks

985
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:00,787
and stuff, right?

986
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,155
This is no longer
science fiction.

987
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:03,557
This is like,
"Let's go to Congress

988
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:05,359
and ask for money to do it."

989
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:07,761
- Audience Member 3: You said if
all life on Earth died...

990
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:08,929
- Mm-hmm.

991
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,697
- That within
a couple thousand years,

992
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:12,299
the oxygen and the atmosphere
would be gone.

993
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,500
- Thomas: Yeah.
- Why?

994
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:14,902
What would it make it go away?

995
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:17,638
- Right, so why does the oxygen
disappear if life disappears?

996
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,007
So oxygen, I mean,
it's sort of the reason why

997
00:42:20,073 --> 00:42:21,341
it's so fundamental to life,

998
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:24,745
'cause oxygen is
incredibly reactive with stuff.

999
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:29,349
So oxygen, it will disappear
into rocks through rust.

1000
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,985
It will, you know, go into--

1001
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:36,823
Sort of like acid rain,
it will go into the water.

1002
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,360
And it'll go into the seafloor
in, like, lime or something.

1003
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,730
It just gets absorbed
into rocks and water

1004
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:46,567
and geologic processes
very quickly.

1005
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,769
- Audience Member 3: So it's not
that it would be--

1006
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:51,171
like, just drift away or be
blown away by the solar wind.

1007
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,373
- Oh, no, yeah, so it doesn't
escape from the Earth.

1008
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,575
It doesn't--
It still stays here.

1009
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:55,976
Just, it's gonna go
into the rocks.

1010
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:57,578
We're gonna turn into Mars,
effectively.

1011
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:59,479
We're gonna turn into
a rusty red planet

1012
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:03,016
if all the life disappeared,
yeah.

1013
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,184
Yeah?

1014
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,786
- Audience Member 4:
So how many times

1015
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:07,187
do you have to observe
an exoplanet

1016
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:10,958
before you actually confirm that
you think it's an exoplanet,

1017
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:13,994
and how do you track its
location so that in the future,

1018
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,730
you can have the Webb
check back?

1019
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,665
- Right, so how many times

1020
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:21,134
do you have to look
at an exoplanet to confirm it,

1021
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:24,071
and then how do we track it
so we can look at it later?

1022
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:27,608
So confirmation
observations are--

1023
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,881
So actually, the planets
that I'm working on

1024
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,949
with a student right now
are probably a good way

1025
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:38,886
to explain what the process is.

1026
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:41,321
So there's a NASA mission up
right now called TESS,

1027
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:44,157
which is just scanning
the sky for new exoplanets,

1028
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:45,559
and so it finds
something that looks

1029
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:46,727
like a transiting exoplanet,

1030
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,529
like a planet going
in front of its star.

1031
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:50,497
It's measuring the brightness
of all the stars,

1032
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:52,566
but one of the problems
is that there's,

1033
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,968
for lack of a better word,
a lot of things that go

1034
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:57,738
bump in the night that look
like planets but are not.

1035
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:01,074
There's a lot of things
like stars and other, you know,

1036
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:03,944
things that aren't planets that
can mimic those transit signals.

1037
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:06,747
So we get a lot of candidates
and then we have to refine that,

1038
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:11,018
so we look at it with
telescopes like WIYN, right,

1039
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,420
that we have in Kitt Peak
to look for the star moving,

1040
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,422
and if we see the star moving,
that tells us

1041
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,991
the mass of the object,
and so we get a good mass.

1042
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:20,994
Usually, we'll look at it with
bigger telescopes on the ground

1043
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:22,596
to make sure it's happening
on the star

1044
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:24,998
we think it's happening on.

1045
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:27,000
And so that's most
of the confirmation process.

1046
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,403
If you can see the planet
go in front of the star,

1047
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:32,139
if you can measure the mass
from the star

1048
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:35,275
wobbling back and forth,
and if you can demonstrate

1049
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,278
that there's no nearby star that
you're getting confused with,

1050
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,247
then you're pretty much there,

1051
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:42,950
and you know there's
a planet around that star.

1052
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:47,855
And as a part of that,
we generate what's called,

1053
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:50,724
you know, an ephemeris
for the planet, you know,

1054
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,560
a prediction
for when transits will occur.

1055
00:44:53,627 --> 00:44:55,229
And for the first
couple of years,

1056
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:57,564
those are probably good
to a couple of minutes,

1057
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:00,167
but over time, those will drift,
and some of the planets

1058
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:01,768
that were discovered
10 years ago,

1059
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,203
we don't actually
know the transits

1060
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,906
to better than half an hour
or maybe even hours.

1061
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:09,543
So for JWST observations,
you need to know it to minutes,

1062
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,046
and so there's actually efforts
that a lot of people work on,

1063
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:15,249
that a fair number of people
work on to go back

1064
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:18,552
to older planets and
look at them again to get more,

1065
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,854
sort of reset that drift
on the clock

1066
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:22,890
and figure out
when it's gonna happen

1067
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:26,994
to refine the ephemerides
so we don't lose 'em

1068
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,429
and we still know exactly
when they're going to transit.

1069
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:34,001
So it's a lot of people working
to do both parts of that.

1070
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,704
Uh, yeah?

1071
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:40,374
- Audience Member 5: In the red
ring on the map

1072
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,511
of the Milky Way, like,
where you found the planets,

1073
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:47,514
how far away
are we talking about

1074
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:48,882
as far as, like, light-years,

1075
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,685
and how far back in time
are we looking?

1076
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:55,322
- Right, so how big
is that red ring in light-years,

1077
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:57,724
and how far away are we looking?

1078
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:01,461
So most of the planets that
we know about are probably--

1079
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:04,531
I'm doing a conversion
in my head

1080
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,901
'cause most of us,
a lot of astronomers

1081
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:09,770
use parsecs
instead of light-years.

1082
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,939
Yeah, if you guys ever
wanna be cool

1083
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:13,240
at an astronomy party--

1084
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,442
I don't know why you'd be
going to an astronomy party,

1085
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:19,980
but if you want an invite,
I think Mary has my email.

1086
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,982
Yeah, talk about things
in parsecs.

1087
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:24,651
That's how you know
you're on the in-crowd.

1088
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:29,389
So probably out to about
500 light-years, I'd say,

1089
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:33,060
most of the detections, which
means that most of the planets

1090
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:36,563
we're seeing only about
500 years back in time,

1091
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,900
which, on an astronomical scale,
is pretty small.

1092
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,702
Most of them are actually
even closer than that,

1093
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:44,104
probably within
50-ish light years,

1094
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:46,073
so not very far away.

1095
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,876
The time scales here,
there's one planet we know of,

1096
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:50,878
actually, that's decaying
onto its star.

1097
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:53,514
Like, the orbit is shrinking
and it's falling onto its star,

1098
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,048
and it's happening
incredibly fast,

1099
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,583
which means in 3 million years,

1100
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,619
it's gonna hit
the surface of the star.

1101
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:02,322
So 3 million years is
incredibly fast for astronomers.

1102
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,490
Yeah?

1103
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:05,759
- Audience Member 6: So how big
is it in parsecs?

1104
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:09,897
- It's probably
about 200 parsecs, 300 parsecs.

1105
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:12,599
I guess that's a little bit
more than 500 light-years.

1106
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,802
Yeah, about 200 parsecs,
I'd say.

1107
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,039
There's stuff much further out,
but most of them are centered

1108
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:20,774
closer than that.

1109
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:22,743
Yeah?

1110
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,745
- Audience Member 7:
Is AI going to be able

1111
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:26,580
to help you in your search?

1112
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:29,917
- Is AI gonna be helpful
in this search?

1113
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:32,119
It's funny you ask that
'cause I actually was just part

1114
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:35,656
of a very big proposal
to do just that.

1115
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,793
So there's a bunch of ways.

1116
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,296
I think the thing that got me
really excited--

1117
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:46,033
and this maybe
is a little inside baseball--

1118
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:49,136
but one of the fundamental
limitations we have

1119
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:50,604
is that we have to compute--

1120
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:51,972
We get the observations

1121
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,774
and then we need to compute
atmosphere models, right?

1122
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:55,576
We get the data,
but to actually figure out

1123
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:58,045
what's in the atmosphere,
we need to compute models.

1124
00:47:58,111 --> 00:47:59,780
We need to run
these complicated--

1125
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:02,683
We effectively need to run
a weather model on a computer,

1126
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,518
and we need to do that
a million times

1127
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:07,020
to try and run
all these different parameters.

1128
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:09,923
And so the sorts of systems
I'm working on

1129
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,893
typically take
one to two to three weeks,

1130
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,729
two to three weeks
to run on a computer.

1131
00:48:15,796 --> 00:48:18,498
And that's on, like,
a supercomputer--

1132
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:22,169
it's actually at Arizona State--
but it takes a long time to run,

1133
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,972
and so one of the things
we're particularly looking at

1134
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:27,407
is how can we use AI
to speed up that process

1135
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,610
'cause that's only
a one-dimensional model.

1136
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:33,380
We're not doing any sort
of latitude/longitude modeling.

1137
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:35,315
We're just doing straight
up and down,

1138
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,918
and running it out to a
3-D model, like we would have

1139
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:41,688
on the Earth, would take--
you know, it would take months

1140
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:45,359
to run one of these things,
and we'd need to run 10,000.

1141
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:49,963
So one thing that
I'm interested in looking at

1142
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,599
is how do we use
AI machine learning

1143
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:55,936
to try and speed that up
and get it to run faster,

1144
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:58,939
but right now,
that's just an idea.

1145
00:48:59,006 --> 00:49:01,909
Nobody's actually done it yet.

1146
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,044
Yeah?

1147
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:06,613
- Audience Member 8: Do you
anticipate getting

1148
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,019
beyond the infrared look and
closer to the microwave look

1149
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:16,924
as far as the radio waves?

1150
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,627
- Yeah, so are we
thinking about moving

1151
00:49:20,694 --> 00:49:22,663
into, like, microwave
or radio waves?

1152
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:25,732
So there are people, actually,

1153
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,068
who do that now,
but they don't--

1154
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:32,039
They use radio and microwave
and millimeter waves to--

1155
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:33,607
They don't look at planets,

1156
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:35,509
but they actually look
at protoplanetary disks,

1157
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:38,879
so the stuff that forms planets,
and there are beautiful images

1158
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,548
taken by an observatory
called ALMA

1159
00:49:41,615 --> 00:49:43,483
which just started operating
a couple years ago

1160
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,754
in northern Chile to observe
protoplanetary disks,

1161
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,990
and you can see--
Actually, it's amazing.

1162
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:53,493
Guys, just Google search, like,
"ALMA protoplanetary disk."

1163
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,229
Remember that
and Google search it

1164
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:58,031
'cause it's, there are
these disks of material,

1165
00:49:58,098 --> 00:49:59,633
and then you can see
there are rings.

1166
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,034
There are gaps in the disks.

1167
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:03,036
Those are planets that
are forming that have sucked

1168
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:05,239
all that material
and that ring onto them.

1169
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:06,406
Like, that's Jupiter

1170
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:07,808
that's pulled all that
material onto it.

1171
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,009
And you can't see the planet,

1172
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,611
but you can see all
the gas missing

1173
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,412
where the planet
must be forming.

1174
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:14,047
And it's these amazing images--

1175
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:16,817
There's a woman,
actually here at UW,

1176
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:20,821
Coco Zhang, who does this,
so that's a big part

1177
00:50:20,888 --> 00:50:22,890
of understanding
planet-formation processes.

1178
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:25,092
That's a whole 'nother thing
that I could talk forever about,

1179
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:26,960
is trying to figure that out,
but, yeah,

1180
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:28,962
that's a big part of it as well.

1181
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:32,432
All right,
oh, we got one more, yeah?

1182
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:33,834
- Audience Member 9:
I was wondering,

1183
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:35,836
on the original red disk

1184
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,706
that it said, out of
the 5,761 exoplanets

1185
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,011
that have been discovered,
what is the percentage

1186
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:47,147
of systems that you scanned
that actually come up back

1187
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:50,017
and have an exoplanet
within there?

1188
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,319
- Oh, so, yeah,
so how many stars

1189
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:54,521
do we need to look at
before we find a planet?

1190
00:50:54,588 --> 00:50:59,826
Yeah, so that was my PhD
thesis, was finding exoplanets

1191
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,563
and running
a planet-detection survey.

1192
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:04,298
That's why I'm
particularly bitter

1193
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,934
about not being able
to name them after myself,

1194
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,603
because it was specifically
my PhD--

1195
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,805
I actually asked my PhD
advisor if we could do this,

1196
00:51:11,872 --> 00:51:13,273
and he just was, like,

1197
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,343
"Under no circumstances can you
name this after yourself."

1198
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,314
So the answer is,
we probably looked at...

1199
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:28,255
We looked at about 10,000 stars
before we found one.

1200
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:33,493
But, right, but there's a lot
of what are called

1201
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,929
observational biases
that go into that, right?

1202
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:39,299
So that doesn't mean that one
star out of 10,000 has a planet.

1203
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:42,536
It just means it's very hard
to find transiting planets

1204
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,238
'cause we were looking
for very big ones,

1205
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:45,639
which are pretty rare,

1206
00:51:45,706 --> 00:51:47,574
very close-in ones,
which are pretty rare,

1207
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:49,376
and they needed to go
right across the star,

1208
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:51,578
which is pretty rare, right,
so there's a lot of things

1209
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:53,514
working against us
when we do that search.

1210
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,049
When people have tried
to correct for that and say,

1211
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,519
"Okay, we saw one out of 10,000,
but, you know,

1212
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,187
"we're only gonna see
one out of ten

1213
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:02,656
just because
of the angle probabilities,"

1214
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:04,558
what's the actual rate?

1215
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:08,929
Our actual guess for, say,
how many habitable,

1216
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:12,032
Earth-like planets
are around an average star,

1217
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:16,937
the current best guess
is about one-half to two,

1218
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:20,674
meaning that we think that,
on average,

1219
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:24,478
every single star like the Sun
has a planet like the Earth

1220
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:27,147
pretty close to its
habitable zone, right?

1221
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:29,449
It seems like
planet formation happens,

1222
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:31,051
and it happens all the time,

1223
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:34,188
and it goes, and it makes a lot
of planets around most stars.

1224
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:38,325
So it's hard to find them,
but that's sort of because

1225
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:42,863
they're hard to find,
not because they're rare.

1226
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:46,567
- Audience Member 10: What would
make that job easier?

1227
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:49,937
- What would
make that job easier?

1228
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,472
Uh... bigger telescopes.

1229
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:56,076
Well, no, actually, you know
what would make the jobs easier?

1230
00:52:56,143 --> 00:53:01,148
If the stars cooperated,
'cause, man, let me tell you,

1231
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:06,954
like, the Sun, so to detect
the Earth around the Sun,

1232
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,790
the velocity you're measuring
is about this fast, right?

1233
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:12,292
I am walking at
about two meters per second,

1234
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:13,727
one meter per second.

1235
00:53:13,794 --> 00:53:16,730
That's about how much the Earth
makes the Sun move in speed,

1236
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:18,365
but you're measuring this speed

1237
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:20,534
over the course of a year,
right?

1238
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:24,137
The surface of the Sun
is burbling all the time.

1239
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,873
It's just sort of flexing
a little bit

1240
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:28,575
from solar flares
and all sorts of things, right,

1241
00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:32,379
and the Sun is doing its own,
like, processes inside it.

1242
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:34,381
And so the surface is moving,
and you can imagine

1243
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:36,917
that measuring the whole Sun
moving at this speed

1244
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:40,220
is pretty difficult if the
entire surface is just flexing

1245
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,723
and wringing and bending
underneath you.

1246
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:45,559
So if I could have
anything in the world,

1247
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:48,362
I would tell the stars
to just stand still

1248
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:51,765
for, like, two years so we can
measure them exactly,

1249
00:53:51,832 --> 00:53:54,568
and then if we could
figure that out,

1250
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,470
then we could do it,
and, actually,

1251
00:53:56,537 --> 00:53:58,338
the sort of less joking
answer to that is,

1252
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,140
there's actually
a lot of people working on ways

1253
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:04,111
to try and, like, separate
those two signals

1254
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:06,113
and get down to the level
where we can measure

1255
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,514
a planet like the Earth,

1256
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:12,886
but it's a difficult problem
to try and separate that out.

1257
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:14,521
Yeah?

1258
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,023
- Audience Member 11:
When you actually

1259
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,991
designed the camera...
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1260
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:19,626
Well, helped design, yeah.

1261
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:22,029
- Audience Member 11: Did it
have a lens cap on it?

1262
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:23,630
- Did the camera
have a lens cap?

1263
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:25,365
It did not, no.

1264
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,534
Actually, the thing that
was gonna really get us

1265
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:29,837
was the sun shield on Webb

1266
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:33,574
because the whole thing,
it needs to deploy out.

1267
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,842
Well, I can't have--

1268
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,844
If you look at it, a picture,
there's the mirrors,

1269
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,045
and underneath that,
there's this big--

1270
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,880
it's almost
a tennis court-size thing,

1271
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,215
and that's what shields it.

1272
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,150
All the cameras
need to be kept very cool,

1273
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:45,018
like -200 degrees.

1274
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,321
And so if the Sun
is shining on it,

1275
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,689
you can't keep it that way,

1276
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:51,091
so the sun shield is there
to block out all the sunlight,

1277
00:54:51,158 --> 00:54:53,293
but the problem is, the
sun shield is very thin Mylar

1278
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,461
that rips very easily.

1279
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:56,296
It's designed to be deployed.

1280
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:59,099
It's, like, six layers that all
pull out and then separate,

1281
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:01,435
and it's designed
to be deployed in zero G,

1282
00:55:01,502 --> 00:55:03,003
so it's very thin Mylar

1283
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,605
that's designed
to be deployed in zero G.

1284
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:08,909
It's very hard to test on Earth,
and I remember being in meetings

1285
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:12,212
where they were trying to test
it in Long Beach, California,

1286
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:14,248
where the telescope
was assembled,

1287
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,083
and they'd say, "Oh, yeah,
they tried another test,

1288
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:17,518
"and just all the cables, like,

1289
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:18,886
"jumped out of
their cables trays,

1290
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:21,021
and it stopped, like,
halfway through,"

1291
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:23,223
and you could just see people
around the table be like,

1292
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,591
"What are we doing," right?

1293
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,294
And the woman in charge of
NIRCam, when I worked for her,

1294
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:28,629
I still remember her saying--

1295
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:30,330
She saw this, right,
and was like, "Look.

1296
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:32,900
"Nothing that any of us
do right here

1297
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:35,335
"is gonna affect what happens
with the sun shield, right?

1298
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:36,737
"There's a lot
of very smart people

1299
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:38,505
"who know exactly
how important this is,

1300
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:40,707
"who are working very hard
to make sure it works right

1301
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:43,243
"the first time because
we only get one shot at it,

1302
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,345
"and it's not
worth worrying about.

1303
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:48,715
None of your worrying is gonna
affect what they do," right?

1304
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:51,518
And one of the nice things
about Webb was,

1305
00:55:51,585 --> 00:55:52,986
over time,
it was pretty delayed,

1306
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:54,655
but one of the nice things
was that

1307
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,456
one of the reasons
it was delayed is 'cause

1308
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:58,759
everybody wanted to make sure
it worked the first time,

1309
00:55:58,825 --> 00:56:00,427
and it did.

1310
00:56:00,494 --> 00:56:01,728
It was pretty amazing.

1311
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:04,331
There was pretty much no
problems during commissioning.

1312
00:56:04,398 --> 00:56:06,834
Sun shield deployed
the first time, no problem.

1313
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,870
It still sort of amazes me
that we didn't actually hit

1314
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,939
some sort of major problem
during that whole process,

1315
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:17,144
but it all worked the first time
just like it should've.

1316
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:20,547
All right, well, thanks, guys.

1317
00:56:20,614 --> 00:56:21,715
This was fun.

1318
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:24,151
