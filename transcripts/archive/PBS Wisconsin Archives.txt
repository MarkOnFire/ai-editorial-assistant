At PBS Wisconsin. We believe the value of our programs doesn't end when the credits roll. Preservation is part of our mission, and thanks to generous donations like the one from Andy Anderson, we've been able to preserve some of our earliest educational programs. These programs, many of which were originally recorded on 16mm film, are now over 70 years old and rapidly deteriorating.

By digitizing and restoring these historic broadcasts, we ensure that future generations can access the knowledge, creativity and culture captured in these early productions. Our archives are more than just old footage. There are a living record of Wisconsin's educational legacy.
