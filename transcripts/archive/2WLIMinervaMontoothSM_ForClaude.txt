1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,305
- Minerva Montooth: They all
studied Frank Lloyd Wright.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,707
It was really a school.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,244
That's what Mr. Wright
started it as.

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,913
- Angela Fitzgerald:
Meet Minerva Montooth.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,882
She is 101 years old.

6
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:20,454
And yet, the most surprising
thing about her is not her age.

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,889
It's her address.

8
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,957
- I think I lucked out.

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:28,061
- Angela: Minerva lives at
Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,330
in Spring Green, Wisconsin.

11
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,599
And as one of the last
living apprentices

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:36,637
who worked alongside Mr. Wright,
she is surrounded each day

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,906
by the memories
of their time together.

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,073
- Margo: Daddy's smiling.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,543
There's a picture
of you and Mrs. Wright.

16
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,878
- We were all apprentices.

17
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:49,716
I remember very well
helping build the theater,

18
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,519
which is where Mr. Wright
suggested we had our wedding,

19
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,254
which we did.

20
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,590
- Angela: Minerva met
Frank Lloyd Wright

21
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,659
and his wife, Olgivanna,

22
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,929
through her childhood friend
and eventual husband,

23
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,797
Charles Montooth.

24
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,333
- Charles was
a very good architect.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,235
I didn't know what
an architect was.

26
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,804
You know, a farm community,

27
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,474
they just all built their houses
themselves. [chuckles]

28
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,010
- Angela: Minerva grew up
on a dairy farm.

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,314
She and her sister graduated
top of their class,

30
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,816
guaranteeing scholarships
for college.

31
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,553
It didn't take long for her
to seek new horizons.

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,488
- I went to Chicago,

33
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:33,026
so I worked for the Encyclopedia
of Britannica doing research.

34
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,896
And then I got bored with a
little city like Chicago.

35
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,098
I wanted the big lights.
[chuckles]

36
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,067
So I went to New York.

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,474
I was the specialized librarian
for the advertising agency.

38
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,911
My office was right over Fifth
Avenue, and I just looked down,

39
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,613
and there was the whole city.

40
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,949
And so it was a
pretty glamorous job.

41
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,951
- Angela: Minerva's career
took a turn

42
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,622
when she followed her sister
for a trip out to Arizona,

43
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,158
where an old childhood friend,
Charles Montooth,

44
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,328
had been studying
under Frank Lloyd Wright.

45
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,866
So began years of visiting
Charles in the desert.

46
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,304
- Charles had been asking me
to marry him for five years.

47
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,607
And so, anyway,
I finally said yes.

48
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,314
- Angela: Minerva's shy
outer shell began to melt away.

49
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:32,186
- I mean, my sister and I
were so shy, twin sister.

50
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,055
I tell you, it was
pathological shyness,

51
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:40,260
but I got over it in one day,
meeting Mr. and Mrs. Wright.

52
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,998
- Angela: To escape the
hardships of winter,

53
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,368
the young aspiring architects
studying in Spring Green

54
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,904
would caravan to Arizona.

55
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,107
Charles and Minerva had their
home base in the desert,

56
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,744
where Minerva raised
three children.

57
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,415
- Minerva: We lived for 10 years
in a little house

58
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,052
that Charles built,
which was so cute.

59
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,390
He built it by hand,
all glass doors.

60
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,460
At first it was very small,
and then just gradually

61
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,662
he would add bedrooms.

62
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,098
So it got to be a
five-bedroom house,

63
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,401
I think, when we had
three children.

64
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,973
- Angela: Minerva played an
increasingly important role,

65
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,343
not only in her own family,
but to the Wrights

66
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,145
and eventually their foundation.

67
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,283
Having Mr. Wright speak to me
on a very familiar level,

68
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,554
I mean, we just were friends
for the moment we met.

69
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:44,625
- Angela: In 1959, Olgivanna
assumed the role of president

70
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:50,364
of the Foundation, and Minerva
began to serve as her assistant.

71
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,200
- Assistant to Mrs. Wright,
that's what she called me.

72
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,368
She was like Mr. Wright.

73
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,037
She had an idea,
and she wanted it right now.

74
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,339
I was there for 25 years.

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,377
- Angela: Between Taliesin West,
Spring Green,

76
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,413
and sometimes
international business.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,815
- We went to South Africa.

78
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,685
And Europe many summers.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,224
- Angela: Decades later, Minerva
is the last living fellow

80
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,594
that spent time with the
original apprenticeship.

81
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,096
- Minerva: Absolutely incredible
that I was ever here,

82
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,698
that I was ever married
to Charles,

83
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,768
that I was ever with Mrs. Wright
so long,

84
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,102
and that I'm here still.

85
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,639
It's just, all of it
is unbelievable.

86
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,709
- Angela: And going
to great-grandma's house

87
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,245
is a little extra special.

88
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,914
- I'm in awe that I live here.

89
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,283
Really, I can't believe it.

90
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,452
And I'm very thankful
for all of it.

91
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,321
