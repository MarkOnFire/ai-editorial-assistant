1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,237
- My name is Lucy Wu.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:04,404
I play the cello

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,907
and I am a junior at
Whitefish Bay High School.

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,642
[applause]

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,778
- Announcer: And now Lucy Wu
is taking the stage.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,946
[orchestral music]

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,949
- This is my second time
in the Final Forte.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,220
The first time playing with an
orchestra is very daunting.

9
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,122
But after a while, you realize

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,125
how everyone behind you
is there to support you.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,160
[orchestral music]

12
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,564
I've gotten to play
with three more orchestras

13
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,799
since playing
with the Madison Symphony:

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,535
the Milwaukee Symphony
Orchestra,

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,403
the Chippewa Valley
Symphony Orchestra,

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,040
and the Oistrakh Symphony
of Chicago.

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,411
My quartet at the Music
Institute of Chicago's Academy

18
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,415
had a very successful year
and won many national titles.

19
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:52,419
I love chamber music because it
is all about working in a team.

20
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,621
- Good, good, good, good.

21
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,223
- I will be playing the
third movement

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,458
of the Dvorák Cello Concerto.

23
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,028
This piece is definitely
the most intense piece

24
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,663
I've ever played.

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,567
I've really enjoyed learning
how to approach that.

26
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,968
- Stefan Kartman: Here we go,
boom!

27
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,937
- I've been studying
with Dr. Stefan Kartman

28
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,907
for over seven years,
which is a long time.

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,510
I really enjoy studying
with him.

30
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,813
I think he always has
super inspiring ideas.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,416
- Okay, you need
to make us dream a little bit.

32
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,618
- Lucy: We go beyond playing
the notes in tune

33
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,453
and with good tone.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,623
We go into what kind of story
you want to tell with this.

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,992
- I can tell that you have
a big task ahead,

36
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,661
and that's exactly what you want
at the beginning.

37
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,396
- Lucy: Although my parents
aren't musicians,

38
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,131
we all love music.

39
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,168
My sister is a violinist.
[sister laughing]

40
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,003
She's very good.

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,738
[sister talking]

42
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,674
- Oh, yeah, it's like,
F C minus...

43
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,109
My mom is a math professor,

44
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,112
so I grew up
under her instruction.

45
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,447
- What the interval is, right?

46
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:57,184
The interval is, in theory, AB.
- Lucy: Oh, yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,921
It's definitely helped me
with math at school.

48
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:04,191
I started working at Mathnasium
last September.

49
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,425
Hi, Ruby.

50
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,294
And I really enjoy it.

51
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,129
Let's do two more, then.

52
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,465
I primarily work with
elementary school kids.

53
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,134
And they are just the
sweetest people ever.

54
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,603
It's also very rewarding
to witness their growth.

55
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,572
Oh, that's perfect.

56
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,241
[cello and piano music]

57
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:26,013
I think music is all
about storytelling.

58
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,248
The story with Dvorák
third movement

59
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,450
is definitely a great narrative

60
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:34,421
of a hero's culmination
of their journey.

61
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,291
I really enjoy playing it.

62
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,026
[ending note]

63
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,062
[applause]
