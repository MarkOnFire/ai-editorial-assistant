00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,136
- John McGivern:
I am in a city in Wisconsin

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,404
that is surrounded by water,

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,040
and it's a hub for shipbuilding
on the Great Lakes.

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,775
[bright music]

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,744
- Announcer: We thank
the underwriters

6
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,112
of <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i>

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,249
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

8
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,084
- There's no place
like Oconomowoc.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,119
Explore, play, shop, stay.

10
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,787
Visit Oconomowoc!

11
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,092
- Your community's
best selfie spot is Your-Type!

12
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,827
? ?

13
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:30,464
- You'll find your bright spot
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,100
- My father taught me that
to make great bakery,

15
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,735
you have to do it the right way.

16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:39,706
O&H Danish Bakery,
where kringle traditions begin.

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,778
- Yes, Greendale
is beautiful on the outside,

18
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,915
but it's what's inside
that counts.

19
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,518
Who doesn't love opening
a door to their happy place,

20
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,489
whether it's indulging
your sweet tooth,

21
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,758
winding down,

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,863
or exploring your creative side?

23
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,499
Come on in!

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,368
You just gotta see Greendale!

25
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,438
- The Wisconsin Northwoods
are calling.

26
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,106
One word, one place.

27
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,842
Minocqua.

28
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,911
- Announcer: <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i> is grateful

29
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:21,415

34
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,132
Thanks, underwriters!

35
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,436
? 'Cause these are
our Main Streets ?

36
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,372
? Something 'bout
a hometown speaks to me ?

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,308
? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

38
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,713
? The heart and soul
of community's right here ?

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,916
? On these Main Streets ?

40
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,687
- John: I'm in Sturgeon Bay,
and with a population

41
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,789
of just under 10,000 people,

42
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,760
it is the largest community
in Wisconsin's Door County.

43
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,428
This city on the east side
of Wisconsin

44
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,164
is about three hours north
of Milwaukee,

45
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,168
right in the middle
of Door Peninsula,

46
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,969
and it's surrounded by water.

47
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,173
It's split in two by a bay
of the same name, Sturgeon Bay,

48
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,675
and you have Lake Michigan
on the east

49
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,711
and the bay of Green Bay
on the west.

50
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,247
Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.

51
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,083
The city of Sturgeon Bay
is on both sides

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,251
of the bay, right, Emmy?

53
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,886
- Emmy Fink: It is;
so first,

54
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,155
what was established was
the community of Graham,

55
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,557
on the east side of the bay.

56
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,127
That was in the 1850s,
and settlers came from Europe,

57
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:44,331
Scandinavia, but it officially
became Sturgeon Bay in 1883.

58
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,333
- How did the other side
of town come about?

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,135
- Emmy: So that area was known
as Sawyer.

60
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,937
- John: Okay.
- Emmy: And the only way

61
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,538
to get there was
on a toll bridge,

62
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,773
which was also a railroad.

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,008
Well, in time, the friends
on both sides of the bay

64
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,543
decided to just merge together,

65
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,011
but they liked that
Sturgeon Bay name,

66
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,213
so they kept that.

67
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,448
- Really a beautiful area,
but the problem:

68
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,883
hard access to Lake Michigan.

69
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,552
- It's hard to imagine,
but the bay did not go

70
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,588
through to Lake Michigan,
so, just think,

71
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,623
these ships had to make
this dangerous journey

72
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,625
up through the top
of the peninsula

73
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,661
and back down, which that area
is known as Death's Door.

74
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,263
- Had you heard
of Death's Door before?

75
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,932
- Only because they're
a distilling company,

76
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,335
but, you know, you do
a little history, and...

77
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,136
- You know.
- Now I know, but, yeah,

78
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,072
then the canal was built.

79
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,473
They brought it over
to Lake Michigan,

80
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,575
and it really put
Sturgeon Bay on the map.

81
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,776
- John: And just look around.

82
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,879
You can tell that it's still
a working waterway.

83
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,146
- Emmy: Absolutely.

84
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,249
It's all maintained
by the Army Corps of Engineers,

85
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,284
and there is such a story here,

86
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,019
such a legacy
behind shipbuilding,

87
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,722
and they are so proud
of that shipbuilding legacy

88
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,023
on the Great Lakes.

89
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,625
- So much to learn.
- It's beautiful.

90
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,026
- John: Let's learn more,
Emmy, okay?

91
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,628
- Emmy: Okay.

92
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,229
- John: We couldn't come
to Sturgeon Bay

93
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,397
without talking
about shipbuilding.

94
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,598
- Justin Slater:
Fincantieri Bay shipbuilding.

95
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,000
- John: Fincantieri
is what I heard.

96
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,401
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

97
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,802
- John: Where are we
going first?

98
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,804
- Justin: Today, we're gonna
go up to the top

99
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,072
of our large gantry crane.

100
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,675
We call it Big Blue.
- John: Why do you call it that?

101
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,677
'Cause it's blue, right?
- Justin: It's big and blue.

102
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,879
And it's used in the process
of building the ships here

103
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,047
and supporting
our repair process.

104
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,782
- Oh, hello!
- So.

105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,617
- You have a graving dock.

106
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,419
You also have a floating dock,
you told me.

107
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,421
- Justin: Yeah, so--
- John: And the floating dock,

108
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,589
what's the difference?

109
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,191
- Justin: So a graving dock
is built

110
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,458
below the surface of the water.

111
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,994
The floating dry dock
is filled with water, sinks,

112
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,162
and then pumped out.

113
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,764
- Can we talk history
about this place?

114
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,667
- Justin: Bay Shipbuilding
started life in 1902

115
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,268
in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

116
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,337
- John: Okay.
- Justin: In 1968, the ships

117
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,173
were getting too big
for the river that they were on,

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,509
so they moved
the shipbuilding facility

119
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,977
up here to Sturgeon Bay,

120
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:41,381
and then in 2008,
Fincantieri purchased Bay Ship,

121
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,985
Marinette Marine,
and a couple of repair yards

122
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,753
and formed
the Fincantieri Marine Group

123
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,988
in the United States.

124
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,190
- John: Can I get on a ship?
- Justin: Certainly.

125
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,992
We're able to go
on the <i>Herbert Jackson</i> today.

126
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,393
- John: What's the
<i>Herbert Jackson</i> do?

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,995
- Justin: So it is
a bulk carrier.

128
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,396
It operates here
on the Great Lakes.

129
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,599
It came in for some repairs.
- Man: We made it.

130
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,800
- John: Wow, this thing's huge.

131
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:00,968
What does this carry?

132
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,402
- Man: This carries
mainly iron ore.

133
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,271
- John: How many people
work on this thing?

134
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,806
- Man: Twenty-five.
- John: Twenty-five.

135
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:06,974
- Man: Thirty.

136
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,141
There's Cole.

137
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,943
- John: Hey, my name's John.
- Cole: Cole.

138
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,745
- John: Good to meet you.
- Cole: Likewise.

139
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,547
I'm the officer in charge
of the navigational watch.

140
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,715
That's my official title.

141
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,916
- That's your chair
right there?

142
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,317
- Yep.
- Where do you nap?

143
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,485
How are you?

144
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,686
I'm John, good to meet you.

145
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,488
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the captain?

146
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,656
How long you been captaining?

147
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,857
- Three weeks.
- Three, what?

148
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,259
- Three weeks ago.
- What the--

149
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,261
- What's going on here?
- Man: I know, John.

150
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,863
- John: It's a good gig, huh?
- Cole: It is, great gig.

151
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,665
- John: Thanks for talking
to me, you guys.

152
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,667
- Captain: Thank you.
- John: Have a good season.

153
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,269
- Captain: Thank you.
- John: Thank you.

154
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,070
- Emmy: Have you noticed
a theme around town?

155
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,272
Nope, they're not sturgeon;
they're bass.

156
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,439
Bass around the bay.

157
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,242
There are 27 of these fish
all around town.

158
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,144
If you would like
to lure one in yourself,

159
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,812
go on the online auction.

160
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,682
It actually benefits
the local art programs.

161
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,151
- People in Sturgeon Bay
are committed to being awake.

162
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,720
There are three coffee shops
on this block alone.

163
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,256
It's called Little Seattle.

164
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,993
To Little Seattle here
in Sturgeon Bay.

165
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,396
- John: So Waterfront Mary
is who?

166
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,997
- Patti Hanson: Our daughter.
- Your daughter?

167
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,799
- Our youngest daughter,
we named it after her.

168
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,201
- Was she like,
"Well, thank you?"

169
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,635
Let's talk about
what goes on here.

170
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,504
- Jon Hanson: We have
a restaurant, full menu,

171
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,506
plus we do a fish boil
six nights a week.

172
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,907
- Six nights a week.
- Yes.

173
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,709
- John: You couldn't have
a more beautiful spot.

174
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,910
When did you take this place?

175
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,112
- Jon: We bought it in 1992,
and we opened it

176
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,480
about six, seven months
afterwards.

177
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,383
- Patti: We picked Sturgeon Bay
for obvious reasons,

178
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,651
and we've never left.

179
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,653
- Jon: 'Cause it's such
a fantastic place to live.

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,255
- John: We're here
for a fish boil,

181
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,457
just so you know.
- Emmy: ? Yes, we are. ?

182
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,625
- John: We're very excited.

183
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:32,793
So let's talk process.

184
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,961
What's gonna happen?

185
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,562
We have a big pot
of boiling water.

186
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,964
- Mike Jensen: Yes, sir.

187
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,566
So what I'll do is I will go
grab the potatoes and carrots.

188
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,368
- John: Okay.
- Mike: Drop 'em in there,

189
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,970
put one pound
of sea salt in it,

190
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,171
let it cook for 10 minutes.

191
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,772
- John: What kind of potatoes
are they?

192
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,374
- Mike: Baby reds.
- John: Baby reds.

193
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,176
- Mike: Yep.
- And why don't you put

194
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,344
the onions in now, too?

195
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,145
- Those will be coming
in about three minutes.

196
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,047
Onion in for another 10 minutes.

197
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,117
- I feel like we're doing
<i>Survivor</i> or something.

198
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,552
- Mike: Yeah, kind of.

199
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,153
- And you can tell
it looks good?

200
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,421
- Yeah, it's looking great.

201
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,156
Everything's moving around,
water's good.

202
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,526
- Here goes the cod.
- Here it goes.

203
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,728
- You're the cod people.
- We are the cod people.

204
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,329
- Do they do cod
at other places?

205
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,331
- No, we are the only ones
in Door County

206
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,499
that actually do cod.

207
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,700
That'll go in for 10 minutes.

208
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,102
Let her cook for a little bit.

209
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,104
I'll ring a bell,
and then the show goes on.

210
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,338
[bell ringing]

211
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,074
Come on down for the fish boil!

212
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,843
Welcome to Waterfront Mary's,
folks.

213
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,444
I'm Mike, I'll be your
boil master tonight.

214
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,712
How is everyone?

215
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,115
- John: And what do you then
throw on to flame it?

216
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,316
- Mike: Kerosene.
- John: Kerosene.

217
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,352
- Mike: Two, three.
[fire whooshes]

218
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,988
[cheering and applause]

219
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,457
- John: So then that's all
served on one platter?

220
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,893
- Mike: A plate will come out
with potatoes, carrots, onions.

221
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,495
- John: Okay.
- Mike: Marble rye bread,

222
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,263
lemon, melted butter.
- John: Uh-huh.

223
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,098
- Mike: And then when
you're done with that,

224
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,266
then we'll bring you out

225
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,035
the Door County
cherry pie a la mode.

226
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,436
- There you go.
- Hey, guys.

227
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,271
- Wow!
- We're very excited.

228
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,806
- Emmy: It looks fantastic.

229
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,775
Mmm, poor man's lobster.

230
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,377
- Poor man's lobster.
- Emmy: I love the idea of cod,

231
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,980
and I love that this is
the only place that they do it.

232
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,248
This is delicious!

233
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,784
Mike did a great job.
- John: Emmy's packing it on.

234
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,352
Are there seconds?

235
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,754
[Emmy and John laughing]

236
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,325
There are three lighthouses
in Sturgeon Bay.

237
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,628
Two can be seen from the
north entrance to the canal.

238
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,131
This one right here is like
the postcard of Sturgeon Bay.

239
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,901
It is the North Pierhead Light,

240
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,503
and it's one of the most
photographed things

241
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,738
in all of Door County.

242
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,640
That is the Canal Station
Lighthouse,

243
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,208
so different than its neighbor.

244
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,811
This is what I really think of
when I think of a lighthouse,

245
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,412
and the third one's
on the opposite end

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,882
of the peninsula,
the entrance to Sturgeon Bay.

247
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,618
It's called
the Sherwood Point Lighthouse.

248
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,154
So Sherwood and Canal
are only open one time a year.

249
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,423
That's during
the annual Lighthouse Walk.

250
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,426
It happens in June,
but you can't get in that house.

251
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,594
Why?

252
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,996
Because that's a private house.

253
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:54,201
Somebody bought that lighthouse
at an auction for $44,000.

254
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,537
I paid more for my Volkswagen!

255
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,272
I did.

256
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,507
There is a whole lot
of history right here

257
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,009
on the waterfront
in Sturgeon Bay.

258
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,177
- There is.

259
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,811
So we're at the Door County
Maritime Museum.

260
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,313
Ten floors to explore,

261
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,714
and I'm telling you,
I don't think

262
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,716
I've ever seen
a vertical museum.

263
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,718
- John: Vertical, yeah.
- Emmy: I mean, every floor

264
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,920
is gonna be a new story.

265
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,721
- John: Okay, I'll start
at the tenth floor.

266
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,323
I will do all
of the even floors.

267
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,125
You will do the odd floors.
- But why?

268
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,293
You're the odd one.

269
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,460
I'll take even.

270
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,062
- No, no, no,
I'll do the even.

271
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,230
She just called me odd.

272
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,199
No, come on, come on.

273
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,800
- Kevin Osgood:
This is the highest

274
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,236
indoor observation point
in all of Door County.

275
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,438
- John: Floor 10,
and if you were to say this

276
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,240
is what floor 10's about,
what would you say?

277
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,842
- Kevin: The working waterfront
of Sturgeon Bay.

278
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,443
You see it moving,
you see the ships,

279
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,679
you see the pleasure craft,
you see the hotels, everything.

280
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,480
You start at the top,
and then you start

281
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,049
to descend back through history
and learn

282
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,650
how we got where we are today.

283
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,253
- Here we go.
- Absolutely.

284
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,554
Where it all started.

285
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,424
- Kevin, So this floor is
all about the peninsula.

286
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,759
- Kevin: The whole area was
carved out by glaciers.

287
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,561
- Emmy: 400 million years ago.

288
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,029
- This has been here so long,

289
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,032
and we're so lucky to have it,
and we need to take care of it,

290
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,034
and that's the message we
want everyone to take away.

291
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,036
- Emmy: I love it.
- Kevin: This is 8.

292
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,571
This represents
the people of the peninsula,

293
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,673
and almost 80%
of this floor focuses

294
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,942
on the Native Americans that
first came here

295
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,611
and hunted here and lived here.

296
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,479
- John: This really honors that.

297
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,281
- And it also shows
what happened,

298
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,716
how things transitioned.

299
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,018
This one starts where
the previous floor leaves off.

300
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,287
- Emmy: Mm-hmm,
I absolutely love maps.

301
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,689
- You're looking at a map
that was done in the 1850s,

302
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,225
so a lot of it was
just guesswork.

303
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,560
So lighthouses were
really important

304
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,829
because the charts
were really not that helpful,

305
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,865
so you needed to know
where you were with lighthouses.

306
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,667
After navigation,
there was commerce, right?

307
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,269
- John: Yeah.
- Kevin: The major industries

308
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,870
that were here, you know,
the fur trade,

309
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,573
limestone quarries, logging,
even ice harvesting.

310
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,742
- And commercial fishing,
which still goes on.

311
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,977
- Commercial fishing,
yes, absolutely still goes on.

312
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,279
- And tourism.

313
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,281
- Kevin: All the resources that
were here for trade,

314
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,683
how do you get it to the cities
around the Great Lakes?

315
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,618
So shipbuilding
with wooden ships was first,

316
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,321
easily transitioned
to metal rivets and welding,

317
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,789
and then World War II
came along,

318
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,324
and this became a boom town.

319
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,960
At one point during the war,
they were turning out

320
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,930
a new ship every five days
from shipyards in Sturgeon Bay.

321
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,765
- What a beautiful legacy.

322
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,667
- Kevin: This floor is all
about recreational boating.

323
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,570
It's been a part of life
in Sturgeon Bay

324
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,737
from the earliest days.

325
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,972
- John: Kayaks and paddle boats.

326
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,373
- Kevin: And canoes.
- John: Canoes.

327
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,576
- Kevin: You can see
<i>Life</i> magazine did a big spread

328
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,345
on recreational boating here.

329
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,180
- We're bringing
everything full circle

330
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,649
on this floor because
it's the web of life.

331
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,052
- Kevin: This is all the life
that's in the water here.

332
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,887
- We're gonna learn
about this fish right here.

333
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,055
- The lake trout.

334
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,723
These are the invasive species.
- Emmy: Wow.

335
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,625
- Kevin: And then there's
introduced species.

336
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,827
One of those-- salmon.

337
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,762
- I'm learning so much.

338
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,364
- Kevin: This is
where the shipwrecks are,

339
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,700
and Door County's
300 miles of shoreline

340
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,202
has more than
250 shipwrecks around it,

341
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,804
and you know what
the number-one reason is?

342
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,038
- Fierce storms.

343
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,074
- Human error.
- Human error.

344
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,242
- Kevin: Human error.

345
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,743
Now you're sinking,
you're on the bottom.

346
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,278
[John laughing]

347
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,982
The message on the first floor
sort of summarizes everything.

348
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,552
All the industry,
all of our tourists, everything.

349
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,455
You either come here or work
here because of our connection

350
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,858
to the water,
and we have to take care of it.

351
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,994
- Did you know there were
tunnels built

352
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,565
underneath the street
all over downtown Sturgeon Bay?

353
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,433
Why were these tunnels built?

354
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,169
[playful music]

355
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,104
- Beneath 3rd Avenue,

356
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,239
there was a series
of underground tunnels

357
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,341
that carried steam.

358
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,744
Were you thinking
Prohibition tunnels?

359
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,615
Not everything in this state
is about booze, people.

360
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,217
- John: Let's first talk
about the building.

361
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,952
Historic building built when?

362
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,721
- Reagan Smoker: 1884.
- John: On 3rd Avenue.

363
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,824
- And this used to be
Cedar Street.

364
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,626
Hence, Cedar Crossing.

365
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,061
- John: I was wondering.

366
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,263
Was this your business before
you came here seven years ago?

367
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,132
- So I was in retail management.

368
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,634
I came from the East Coast,
big city.

369
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,837
Came back to where
my grandparents grew up.

370
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,005
Came for the summer, loved it,

371
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,741
and this was a great opportunity
to kind of come back

372
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,910
and slow things down
in a different way for me.

373
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,079
My uncle and I,
he was truly talking

374
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:02,216
about something that he wanted
to do when he retired.

375
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,384
- John: Take over?
- Reagan: 2017 is when

376
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,555
we took over, and we gave it
a little fresh space

377
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,257
to the restaurant
and to the bar.

378
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,059
- You have a bar,
you have a restaurant,

379
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,660
you have an inn,
you have a bakery.

380
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:14,828
- Reagan: We do.

381
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,630
- John: And do you run
all of it?

382
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:17,798
- Reagan: I do, yes.

383
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,600
We have a lot
of amazing people in here.

384
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,201
It is not just me.
- John: Okay.

385
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,771
She really likes you guys.
[all laughing]

386
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,240
So there's nine rooms.
- Yeah.

387
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,841
- John: But before they
became nine rooms,

388
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,643
were they apartments up there?
- Reagan: There were.

389
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,044
The shopkeeps lived upstairs.

390
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,580
We definitely wanted to freshen.

391
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,182
- John: Yeah.
- Reagan: We just wanted

392
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,050
to make it homey, the doilies.

393
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,452
- John: Doily,
it brings the image.

394
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,686
We're going into the restaurant.

395
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,688
If it's packed out,
how many people are in here?

396
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,891
- Reagan: So we have, between
the restaurant and the bar,

397
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,792
we're gonna have about
80 people in our building.

398
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:49,530
Frank is our "deer" friend.
[laughing]

399
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,331
- John: Ta-da!

400
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:52,499
It's pretty cool!

401
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,101
I know what you're thinking.

402
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,903
It's a little over-the-top
with that wallpaper.

403
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,471
I don't care; I love it.

404
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,473
- Reagan: This is a great
building to celebrate in.

405
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,176
I feel like that's what
we really like to do here.

406
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,511
It's the little things in life,
but what we do is

407
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,914
just give people a smile.

408
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,483
- Sturgeon Bay has
two downtowns,

409
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,585
the east side and the west side,

410
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,021
and you can get to both
by the historic steel bridge.

411
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,391
It opened in 1931,
and there was an effort

412
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,127
to demolish this bridge,
but local musicians

413
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,696
and their friends,
such as Jackson Browne,

414
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:23,864
came together
for something called

415
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:27,167
the Steel Bridge Songfest
in 2005,

416
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,770
and they saved this bridge,

417
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,905
and they continue
that effort to preserve

418
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,408
this historic architecture.

419
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,044
[funky blues guitar music]

420
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,747
She's a singer/songwriter,
she's a teacher.

421
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,349
How are you?
- Cathy Grier: I'm great.

422
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,517
Nice to meet you.

423
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,918
- I'm really excited
to meet you.

424
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,119
How did this happen for you?

425
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,521
- Cathy: As a songwriter,
I heard

426
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,157
about the Steel Bridge
Song Festival in 2016,

427
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,492
and so I drove all the way
from New York City

428
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,928
out here for a week,
and while I was here,

429
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,396
somebody said,
"You're gonna move here."

430
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,198
And then I looked around
at the real estate,

431
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,800
and I said, "Maybe I will."
[both laughing]

432
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,768
- John: There you go.

433
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,837
- ? The right track ?

434
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,273
- If I were to ask, like,
how do you describe

435
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,441
yourself as a musician?

436
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,911
- Cathy: Eclectic, feeling,
heartfelt advocate

437
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:14,314
of doing music
to help people bridge

438
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,651
ignorance, hate,
love, all those things,

439
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,020
and I think as long
as you open yourself up

440
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,723
and ask questions,
you can agree to disagree,

441
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,659
but we can always find
that one common thing.

442
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,060
- John: Blues,
do you love blues?

443
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,696
- Cathy: Yeah,
that's my main focus,

444
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,467
but I don't think of myself
as a true blues player.

445
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:38,539
I am blues in heart and soul,
and I love the blues style.

446
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,841
[cheering and applause]

447
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,677
[blues guitar music]
? Oh... ?

448
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,179
- So being from New York,

449
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,915
does this at all feel
like home to you,

450
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,082
or is it really different?

451
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,485
- Cathy: So I was
in New York City for 20 years,

452
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:54,054
but before that, I was
in Paris and South of France

453
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,056
for almost 10 years,
and I've traveled so much

454
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,059
in my life that I'm home
wherever I make my community.

455
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,460
- John: Yeah, yeah.
- Cathy: Yeah.

456
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,062
I just happen to love what I do,

457
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,664
and I happen to be
a performer, so...

458
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,465
- John: And don't you feel lucky
doing it?

459
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,633
- Cathy: Absolutely.

460
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,535
Sometimes, I call people
out of the audience.

461
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,237
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

462
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,638
- Yeah.

463
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,173
[cheering and applause]

464
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,875
- And I have a cigar box.

465
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,277
I go out in the audience,
and sometimes I take it off

466
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,479
and hand it to people
and ask them to play it.

467
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,281
- John: Here you go.
- Cathy: Yeah.

468
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,683
[playing blues]

469
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,351
Yeah, you got it.

470
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,520
Oh, yeah!
[chuckles]

471
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,723
- Oh, yeah.
- Cathy: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

472
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,458
[applause]

473
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,195
- The Holiday Music Motel
is quite the landmark

474
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,364
because of its retro decor.

475
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:41,235
It was the first motel built
in Door County in 1952,

476
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,036
so every room looks different.

477
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,139
It has its own collection
of mid-century modern furniture.

478
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,942
We're talking lampshades,
bathroom tile.

479
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,111
You name it, they do it right.

480
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,880
Especially artists
and musicians,

481
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,248
they love to come here.

482
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,484
Apparently, they really
channel their creativity.

483
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:58,886
- It wouldn't be
a main street

484
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,053
without a little shopping.

485
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,855
Oh, wait, you don't know
what you're looking for?

486
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,091
Well, have I got
the place for you.

487
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,293
3rd Avenue, the Marketplace.

488
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,861
They've got everything.

489
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:09,930
[gasps]
Resort wear!

490
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,666
You do know what you're
shopping for,

491
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,434
and it's for your kids?

492
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,969
Oh, no, oh, your grandkid?

493
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,771
Well, then you gotta come
to the Dancing Bear

494
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,673
'cause you'll find it in here.

495
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,142
I am sitting in front
of my favorite shopping.

496
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,411
It's like this
thrift consignment shop,

497
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,014
where talk about finding
anything and everything.

498
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,749
Like this.

499
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,652
Like, this is for sale,
this great little bench.

500
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,821
I just don't know if there's
room in the crew van.

501
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:39,226
Gail, would you mind sitting on
the roof of the van?

502
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,961
- Again?

503
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:44,031
- John: We're
at Door County Forgeworks.

504
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,199
You're a forger.

505
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,366
- Ric Furrer:
Blacksmith, usually.

506
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,869
Blacksmiths
historically were making tools

507
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,804
for the village
that they lived in.

508
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,105
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,774
- So what's a forge?

510
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,976
- Ric: Forge is the item
that does the heating.

511
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,311
Think of it like an oven.

512
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,979
- John: And what do you forge?

513
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:01,648
- People ask me mostly
for swords and knives,

514
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,518
so that tends to be
what I focus on now.

515
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,919
- John: Can we take a look?

516
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:07,521
- Ric: We have pieces that
I've made.

517
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,922
Here, pull that one out
of there.

518
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,724
- John: Can I?
- There's a chef's knife.

519
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,125
- Wow, I love the design.

520
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,293
It's really cool.

521
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,761
So will this ever be used?

522
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,630
- I hope so.
- By you?

523
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,166
- Well, I'd rather sell it.

524
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,534
- You would?
- But--

525
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,403
- So this is what we have here!
[both laughing]

526
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,439
- So here is a kitchen cleaver.

527
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,040
- There you go.
- Look at this!

528
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,208
This is gorgeous.

529
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,376
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

530
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,978
- You are gonna
experience a little bit

531
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,579
of hot reality here.
- I can't wait.

532
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,781
You have a look
in your eye of pity for me.

533
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,350
Do you know?
[Ric laughing]

534
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,521
- I forge, mostly
now, it's pattern-welded steel

535
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,023
because that's what
people ask me to do.

536
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,158
- It's cooking!
- It is warm.

537
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,927
So what's happening
is the water is

538
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,062
boiling out of the borax.

539
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,430
- John: Borax.
- Ric: Yeah.

540
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,967
And it chemically cleans
the steel.

541
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,402
- John: That looks like cotton.

542
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,538
- Ric: It is,
but it can withstand

543
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,940
a tremendous amount of heat.

544
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,009
- John: What does somebody
who learns

545
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,045
that art of blacksmithing,
like, what do they--

546
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:06,880
is there
a path they usually take?

547
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:10,717
- Ric: There are apprenticeships
that were historically done.

548
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:13,420
That's changed a little bit now.

549
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:17,057
There are blacksmith programs
at universities now.

550
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,458
- Can I get it?
- Yes.

551
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,860
- I'm bringing it over.
- Yes.

552
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,396
- John: Oh, my God,
look at this thing!

553
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,131
Is there something
you'd rather make?

554
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,967
- Ric: Well, I have projects
that I enjoy doing,

555
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:31,805
but I really enjoy the idea
of the next project,

556
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:34,107
not the reality
of the current one.

557
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,843
- My heart--

558
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,979
My heart is...

559
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,682
- Ric: Blacksmiths
do the heavy, hot work...

560
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,850
- John: Yeah.

561
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,785
- Ric: Because the
resulting piece is black.

562
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,019
There are whitesmiths.

563
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,555
They're the ones
that do the finish work.

564
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,592
Lather, rinse, repeat,
that's all it is,

565
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,161
but we'll probably
do that two more times,

566
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:57,097
and then I'll take over
under Baby Hugey there.

567
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:58,265
- John: Okay.

568
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,767
- Ric: And that hits
three times a second

569
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,402
with about 80 tons of force.

570
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,670
- John: You do it.

571
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,305
[hammer striking]

572
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,708
- Ric: So that's kind of what
you're gonna end up with

573
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,076
with that cherry handle.

574
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,677
- John: Very cool.
- Ric: Yeah.

575
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,079
- John: Yeah,
there's some steam, right?

576
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,247
- Ric: That's smoke.

577
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,015
Lift it up,
there's your quenched knife.

578
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,283
So that's hardened.

579
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,485
So there's your...
- John: Oh, my God, look at me!

580
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:19,653
- Nice!
- Yep.

581
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,854
- It looks good, doesn't it?

582
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,422
- That'll work well
in a kitchen.

583
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,025
- Whenever I hear
the word "forge" now,

584
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,426
you are what I will think of.

585
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:27,828
- Aww.
- Just so you know.

586
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,429
This is what a forge guy
looks like.

587
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,999
[both laughing]
- John: Oh, you're good.

588
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,467
- Here's my Sturgeon Bay tip.

589
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:36,336
We found this adorable
chapel-turned-restaurant

590
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,105
called Dromhus.

591
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,707
Now, it means "dreamhouse"
in Swedish,

592
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,010
and you know what sounds
dreamy to me in Swedish?

593
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,912
These meatballs.

594
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,515
Mm, dreamy!

595
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,152
- John: This has gotta be
a very important building

596
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:54,388
because it originated
on this side of town,

597
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,556
which is the west side,

598
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,558
and then they moved it
to the east side

599
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,227
and moved it back
to the west side to save it,

600
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:01,962
to preserve it.

601
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,630
What is that building?

602
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,432
- You know,
you could've just asked me.

603
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,767
I have the answer.

604
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,802
It's the Door County
Granary Building.

605
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,205
It was built in 1901,
and the reason

606
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,242
it's so special is because
it's one of the last remaining

607
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,213
wooden granary elevators
on the Great Lakes.

608
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,849
Pretty special.
- So smart.

609
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,051
Emmy Fink.

610
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,687
It's an orchard.

611
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:27,855
It's called Robertson Orchard.

612
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,590
It began in 1879.

613
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,460
I was raised on--
in a neighborhood

614
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,028
in the city of Milwaukee,

615
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,030
so if I ask you a question
that you're like,

616
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,933
"You've gotta be kidding me,"
I just don't know, okay?

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,902
How many different types
of cherries are there?

618
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,504
- Kris Robertson:
You gotta be kidding me.

619
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,872
[John laughing]

620
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,874
- John: How many generations
have been farming this land?

621
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,909
- Kris: My son Skipp
is a fifth generation.

622
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,511
- John: He's the fifth.
- Kris: Yeah.

623
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,045
- Let's talk about
the responsibility

624
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,382
of the fifth generation
running the orchard.

625
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:56,550
Do you feel it?

626
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,951
- Skipp Robertson:
I feel it, John.

627
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,119
- Do you?

628
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:00,521
So were you raised on this land?

629
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,922
- I was.
- Yeah.

630
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,290
So you know cherry farming, huh?

631
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:05,259
- Yeah, I've been here
for 67 years.

632
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,262
- I have been here
since I was born.

633
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,163
- I see that Skipp
has some kids,

634
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,700
so I'm sure there's generations
to come, yes?

635
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:14,868
- Kris: Yep.

636
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,470
- Do you believe that
this will continue?

637
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,472
- If they like it.
- If they like it.

638
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,640
Apples is what I hear,

639
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,475
but cherries is really
kind of your focus, yes?

640
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,643
- Cherries, yeah.

641
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,811
- Montmorencys and Balatons

642
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:26,813
are the two types
of tart cherries that we have.

643
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,515
- Lindsey Robertson: Using those
more for baking,

644
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,584
for pies, those kind of things.

645
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:31,752
- Skipp: And in reality,

646
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:32,953
it should really be called
semisweet.

647
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,055
- So then we have
25 different varieties

648
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,290
of sweet cherries.

649
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,158
- Sweet cherries more
for eating

650
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,827
right off the tree or, you know,
having a snack at home.

651
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:43,230
- John: He said as a kid,
he liked the sweet cherries,

652
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,432
but not anymore.
- He used to sit on the shaker.

653
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,234
His teeth were just black
from eating cherries, stained.

654
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,435
- Is that right?
- Yep.

655
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:50,537
- We haven't even touched
on your apples yet.

656
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:53,140
- Skipp: We have apples as well.
- John: What kind of apples?

657
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,043
- Lindsey: Ginger Gold,
Redfree, Zestar,

658
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,544
Honeycrisp, Cortland.

659
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,745
- Cortland, Wealthy.

660
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,848
- Jonamac, Idared.
- Paula Red.

661
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,216
Did you say McIntosh?

662
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,218
And we have three different
varieties of pears, as well.

663
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:06,520
- Did you know what you
were getting into?

664
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:08,322
- I did know what
I was getting into.

665
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,924
- Oh, good.
[all laughing]

666
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,759
- They need some time,
don't they?

667
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,561
- Ah, they need
a little bit of time.

668
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,463
I'd probably, say,
give it three more weeks.

669
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,498
Tart cherries
are self-pollinating.

670
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,667
Sweet cherries need to have
a cross-pollinator with it.

671
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,169
- So this guy's smaller,
it seems.

672
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,504
Why?

673
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,906
Is it because it's younger?
- If we let a sweet cherry

674
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,708
just keep growing,
it'll get over 30 feet tall.

675
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,376
- Yeah.
- And the same thing

676
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,544
with the tart cherries.

677
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,812
I grew up here.

678
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,581
To me, I didn't realize
how good I had it as a kid,

679
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:36,783
being able to walk out
of the house,

680
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,453
go right out to the tree, grab
something that looked riper

681
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,489
than the rest,
and eat it and enjoy it.

682
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:45,025
- John: The apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

683
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,661
You've heard that before, right?

684
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:50,964
- Of course I have.
[John laughing]

685
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:53,901
- John: Good job.

686
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,969
- I am always up
for an active adventure,

687
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:58,272
and here
at Potawatomi State Park,

688
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,606
they have everything.

689
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:03,177
You can rent bikes, kayaks,
paddleboards, you name it.

690
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:05,913
It also is the start
of the Ice Age Trail.

691
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:08,315
It's a thousand-mile journey
following

692
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,751
the last continental glacier
in Wisconsin.

693
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,419
Such an awesome place.

694
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,021
Put it on your bucket list.

695
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,756
[upbeat music]

696
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,524
You know,
with our Wisconsin roots,

697
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:19,326
we've made so many trips
up to Door County,

698
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:21,728
but when I'm driving up
and I see the Sturgeon Bay sign,

699
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,197
I always think, "the beginning!"

700
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:25,199
- Well, that's funny
because I have come up here

701
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,733
where Sturgeon Bay
was the beginning,

702
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,068
the middle, and the end.

703
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,037
I mean, I really love
this community.

704
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,039
- All right, I'm coming
with you the next time.

705
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,207
- Good, let's do it!

706
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:34,608
No kids though, okay?
- Emmy: Okay.

707
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,809
- John: Don't bring the dog.

708
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:38,545
? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

709
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:41,415
? The heart and soul
of community's ?

710
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,818
I'm gonna be very, um,
there for you.

711
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,687
- God, don't!

712
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,388
That throws me off every time.

713
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:49,890
- Raah!

714
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:53,827
- We are here at Potawatoma--
Potawatoma--Potawatoma--

715
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,195
I can't do it!

716
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,597
- Go in that li-lighthouse.

717
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,764
La la la hoo!

718
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,933
- Kevin: No, I don't wanna walk
with John.

719
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,335
[all laughing]

720
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,936
- Taking one for the team again.

721
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,239
- Woman: Get outta here.

722
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:09,543
- Announcer: We thank
the underwriters

723
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,911
of <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i>

724
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:14,047
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

725
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,883
- There's no place
like Oconomowoc.

726
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,918
Explore, play, shop, stay.

727
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,586
Visit Oconomowoc!

728
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:23,891
- Your community's
best selfie spot is Your-Type.

729
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,626
? ?

730
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:29,263
- You'll find your bright spot
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

731
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,899
- My father taught me that
to make great bakery,

732
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,534
you have to do it the right way.

733
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,505
O&H Danish Bakery,
where kringle traditions begin.

734
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:43,810
- Yes, Greendale
is beautiful on the outside,

735
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,713
but it's what's inside
that counts.

736
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,317
Who doesn't love opening
a door to their happy place,

737
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:54,288
whether it's indulging
your sweet tooth,

738
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,557
winding down,

739
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:01,662
or exploring your creative side?

740
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,298
Come on in!

741
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:07,167
You just gotta see Greendale!

742
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,237
- The Wisconsin Northwoods
are calling.

743
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,738
One word, one place.

744
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:12,940
Minocqua.

745
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,341
?

746
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,710
- Announcer: <i>John McGivern's</i>

00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,200
- They can tell
who the new guy is.

754
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,802
Take a look at the boots.

755
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,737
I still have my price tag on.

756
