00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:03,633
Bob Ross may be public television's
most famous art teacher

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,700
but did you know Wisconsin Public 
Media was a pioneer of arts instruction

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,233
decades before he and his fabulous
perm became a household name?

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:15,000
In 1931, Madison's public 
radio station WHA

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,033
launched the Wisconsin 
School of the Air.

6
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:20,066
The broadcasts were made to serve schools around the state. 

7
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:25,066
Weekday programs covered topics like state history, music,
nature, literature, and more.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,200
In 1936, the Wisconsin School of the Air
debuted the show Let's Draw!

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,300
hosted by James Schwalbach.
The program was meant to introduce

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,066
students to the creative visual arts
and inspire their imaginations.

11
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:39,933
During its run from 1936
to 1970, tens of thousands

12
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,500
of students across the state
tuned in to segments like the following.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,066
That gay little tune boys and girls

14
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,333
is the one that you're going
to look forward to each week

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,666
because it says “Let’s draw!”

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,766
In the mid-1950s the series was
also aired on WHA-TV.

17
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:58,866
Perhaps unsurprisingly, both Let's Draw
and the Joy of Painting emphasized

18
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:02,400
an approach that favored individual
expression and having fun with art.

19
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,866
Isn't that fantastic?

20
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:08,633
Today, PBS Wisconsin Education
continues the tradition of providing quality, fun

21
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:13,333
and free educational content for 
students, parents, and educators everywhere.
