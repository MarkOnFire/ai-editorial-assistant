1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:04,004
- Furs have always
been a fashion item.

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,540
They've always been used
for trim and coats,

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,110
but especially
these days for hats.

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,146
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,151
- Taylor Bailey: I'm so bored
by my fashion choices lately.

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,354
- Kacie Lucchini Butcher: Well,
why don't you take a look

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,955
at some of the
stuff in my closet?

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,957
I have been eyeing up
that new handbag you got.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,694
Maybe we could do a trade.
- Hmm, that's a good idea.

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,862
- It goes pretty deep.

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,430
You're gonna have
to probably dig.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,598
- You're not kidding.

13
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,634
When was the last time
you cleaned this thing?

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,538
- Okay, all right, it's been
a while, don't judge me.

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,773
- Wait, I think
I found something.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,608
How do I get out
of this thing?

17
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,011
- Ugh, hold on,
I'll come get you.

18
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,746
Well, all right.

19
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,449
- Taylor?

20
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,185
- Back here!

21
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,557
Girl, you really gotta do
something about that closet.

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,993
- Maybe it needs, like,
a shoe rack or something.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,295
- Hey, what's that?

24
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,398
- Wait, is that a fur trader
and his wife?

25
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,133
Wait, did we travel
back in time?

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,235
Is this the wardrobe
from Narnia?

27
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,937
- I don't know about all that.

28
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,139
- Well, I mean, it does look
like they have clothes

29
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,640
and maybe they'll barter.

30
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,642
You were looking for new stuff.
- Yeah, I was.

31
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,810
I don't know.

32
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,213
Let's check it out.
- All right.

33
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,514
- Taylor: Hi.
- Kacie: Hi.

34
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,682
- Ah, bonjour, madames.

35
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,018
Je suis Paul l'Avanture,
voyageur extraordinaire,

36
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,520
and I speak English.

37
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,122
- Great, could you repeat
that in English?

38
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,959
- Yes, my name
is Paul l'Avanture.

39
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,126
I'm a voyageur.

40
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,162
That's my profession,
and I speak English,

41
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,897
but you got that part.
- Great.

42
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,100
- And this is my wife,
who is Mukwawagikwe.

43
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,602
- Boozhoo.
- Kacie: Bonjour.

44
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,803
- What do we have here?

45
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,204
You guys have
a lot of things.

46
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,372
Are you selling things?

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,774
- We have a trade blanket,
we are trading.

48
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,276
The Native people
had a forest full

49
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,378
of fur-bearing animals.

50
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,248
And we, the Europeans
wanted those furs,

51
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,884
bring 'em back to Europe
and convert them to money.

52
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,953
- The North American fur trade
refers to the exchange of goods,

53
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,456
including animal furs,
between Europeans

54
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:03,790
and Indigenous peoples.

55
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,360
Native peoples had been
using and trading furs

56
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,830
amongst themselves for thousands
of years in North America.

57
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,665
In the area that
became Wisconsin,

58
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,901
this included the
Menominee, the Ho-Chunk,

59
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,070
Ojibwe, Potawatomi,
and Dakota, among others.

60
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,805
With the arrival of Europeans,

61
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,475
the trade became
a global exchange.

62
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,444
The French, Dutch, British,
and others were keen

63
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,014
to trade with Native partners
across the Atlantic.

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,683
Exchanging goods for furs
and animal skins

65
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,119
may seem like a
simple transaction,

66
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,488
but this was a big deal
for the development

67
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,690
of how Native peoples
in the Americas

68
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,625
interacted with Europeans.

69
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,128
Eventually, the trading
of furs would be connected

70
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,130
not just to clothing
and fashion,

71
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,332
but to global
and local politics,

72
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,134
cultural
and social interactions,

73
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:51,572
labor, religion, and
unfortunately, colonialism.

74
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,707
Why did the
Europeans want furs?

75
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,108
- Well, for a couple of reasons.

76
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,744
Number one, furs have always
been a fashion item.

77
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,147
They've always been used
for trim and coats,

78
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,784
but especially these days
for hats.

79
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,086
- Oh, very fashionable.

80
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,090
- Beaver fur, just the fur,
was made into the hats,

81
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,927
which were so fashionable,
in London and Paris.

82
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,331
And these furs,
these skins would be

83
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,567
stripped from the animal
by the Native women.

84
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:25,172
They'd be dried and scraped,
so they wouldn't rot

85
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,307
during the journey that
might take two years

86
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,276
to get back to Europe.

87
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,444
And the inner fur,

88
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:34,114
the beaver wool
underneath these guard hairs,

89
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,750
would be pressed into a felt

90
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,087
that was made into these
wonderful hats.

91
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,589
And in return,
the Native people

92
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,424
wanted these things
that they couldn't find

93
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:48,495
in their own environment or make
with their own technology.

94
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:54,268
Steel knives, steel axes, brass
kettles, and cloth especially.

95
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,671
Blankets and cloth
to make clothes.

96
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,875
- There is a long history of
humans using fur for clothing.

97
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,711
Animal skins were probably
some of the earliest garments

98
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,048
worn by humans tens
of thousands of years ago.

99
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,651
But by the 1600s and 1700s,

100
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,654
as the North American fur trade
was really getting started,

101
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,657
furs in Europe
were more of a luxury item.

102
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,860
This was in part because
people had hunted many small,

103
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,497
fur-bearing animals almost to
extinction in parts of Europe.

104
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:27,134
The result was that furs
had become very expensive.

105
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,536
The high cost of furs
made them a status symbol

106
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,871
in European fashion.

107
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,706
They were something that
showed off a person's wealth

108
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,842
or their high social standing.

109
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,610
Fur could be used
to trim a garment

110
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,879
or processed into something
like a hat.

111
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,113
- But animal furs and skins

112
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,115
could be about more
than just fashion.

113
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,451
The thick hides of animals
like deer and bison

114
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,019
could be made
into tough leather belts

115
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,289
that were used in the machines
of the early industrial period.

116
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,258
All this meant that
animal skins and furs

117
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,927
were a highly-sought commodity
by European traders

118
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,662
in North America.

119
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,999
- Most of the fur trade
in terms of European money

120
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,734
was in textiles.

121
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,871
- Wow.
- You look a little cold.

122
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,272
- Yeah, you know what?

123
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,573
- I could tell.

124
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,775
- We were just talking about
how I needed new clothes.

125
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,777
- Well, we have
something for you.

126
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,513
- Great.

127
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,616
- Ooh.

128
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,318
- A blanket coat called
a capote.

129
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,454
Would you like to try it?
- Taylor: Yes.

130
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,356
Oh, this is very
heavy material.

131
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,524
- It's a blanket.

132
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,158
- Taylor: Ooh.

133
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,661
- I kind of like that blanket
that doubles as a coat.

134
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,730
- Oh, and it has a hood.

135
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,833
- You've seen these kind
of coats occasionally.

136
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,801
You just cut up a blanket.

137
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,970
You line up the
stripes the right way,

138
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,139
and make a coat out of it.

139
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,942
- How do I look?
- Kacie: Girl, I love it!

140
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,945
- It looks much better
than what I had, right?

141
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,947
- Yeah, and now we'll
give you a good price.

142
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,616
Let's say five beaver,
you can have the whole coat.

143
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,186
- And where did the
glass beads come from?

144
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,687
- Well, they come from Europe.

145
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,523
Now, the Native people
were used to making beads

146
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,859
of bone, stone, teeth,
and shell,

147
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:02,095
but these are glass beads, and
they shimmer in the sunlight.

148
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,397
- I like that.

149
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,199
- And they're new and they're
different, and therefore

150
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,034
they are fashionable.

151
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,538
- All human beings everywhere
in the world like to look fancy.

152
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,540
- I can agree with that.
- Yeah. [both laugh]

153
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,577
- Did the women need the beads?

154
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:22,716
Not any more or less than the
men, but that's fancy.

155
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,118
- Kacie: Yeah.
- It became an exchange

156
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,087
also of the culture.

157
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,257
Occasionally, they would
stay in the village.

158
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:34,928
Among the French fur traders,
there were many families

159
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,998
where a ceremony was performed,

160
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,870
which resulted in the couple
being married.

161
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,773
Many of the voyageurs, rather
than going back to Montreal,

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,775
would stay in the villages.

163
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,845
And their children
were called Métis,

164
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,182
which is the French
word for half.

165
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,751
The term "métis" refers to
the ethnicity and culture

166
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,287
that developed around the
children of European traders

167
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,855
and Indigenous women.

168
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,025
Métis people used elements from
both their parents' cultures,

169
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,860
like parts of their
different languages.

170
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,696
They also adopted new cultural
elements for themselves,

171
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,100
like a type of woven belt
called a ceinture fléchée

172
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,369
that reflected their
fur-trading roots.

173
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,906
Métis people became a key part
of the North American fur trade.

174
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,875
They supplied trading posts
with goods, provided food

175
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,212
like pemmican, a type
of dried beef to travelers,

176
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,347
and worked as clerks
for trading companies,

177
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,349
among other types of labor.

178
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,351
Despite their rich history
and traditions,

179
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,354
Métis people have struggled
for official recognition.

180
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,490
The Canadian government
didn't recognize them

181
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,459
as an Aboriginal group
until 1982,

182
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,763
and the U.S. still
doesn't recognize them.

183
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,399
Well, I don't have
anything to trade you for,

184
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,202
so I think I'm gonna have
to give the coat back.

185
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,970
- Well, but do
come back sometime

186
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,372
with some beaver,
or marten, or otter.

187
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,942
- This has been really cool,
but we need to get back

188
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,109
to the 21st century.

189
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,277
- Yeah.
- Back?

190
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,280
It is the 21st century.
- What?

191
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,482
I thought this was the 1790s.

192
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,553
- No, no, we're in a park
in Madison, Wisconsin.

193
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,222
And we two are historians who,

194
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,325
our hobby is reenacting the
history.

195
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,193
- Oh!
- Oh!

196
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,128
That makes a lot more sense.

197
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:19,633
- Wow, I guess your closet
wasn't a time-traveling closet.

198
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,235
- Well, I'm kind of
bummed about that.

199
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,237
- Wait, why do you
reenact the history?

200
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,838
- Paul Rogovich: Well,
for a few reasons.

201
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,074
Number one, we're passionately
interested in this time

202
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,576
and place in the fur trade.

203
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,645
And you learn by doing.

204
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,413
We learn the crafts,

205
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,249
we learn how to make
the right clothes,

206
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,252
and we just have
a very good time with it.

207
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,653
- Dale Rogovich: The right food.

208
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,055
- The best part is that we meet
the most wonderful people,

209
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,357
the people who come visit us,

210
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,093
and also the people who
participate in these things.

211
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,899
As you know, curious people
are the most interesting people.

212
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,700
- Oh, I don't know, Kacie.

213
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,869
I think I do like my clothes
just fine.

214
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,673
- Yeah, but how many closets can
take you to the fur trade era?

215
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,609
The North American fur trade
played a major role

216
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,712
in the history of European
and Native interactions.

217
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,282
This trade of goods
led to exploration,

218
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,151
political alliances,
new cultures, and more.

219
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,388
Unfortunately, what started out
as a more even exchange

220
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,356
between Europeans
and Indigenous people

221
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,793
would eventually devastate
Native populations,

222
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,462
as more and more settlers
took their lands

223
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,164
and erased their presence.

224
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,800
As important as furs were,
other goods and materials

225
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,869
have also been crucial
for shaping the history

226
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,572
of the Great Lakes area
and Wisconsin.

227
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,241
See if you can find out what
else was traded and exchanged

228
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,578
in the region, both by Native
peoples before Europeans arrived

229
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,847
and in the centuries since then.

230
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,850
Doing so is a reminder that the
movement of goods and peoples

231
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,619
is as old as humanity itself.

232
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,622
- Each of the partners
of the trade thought

233
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,858
that they were getting
the better deal.

234
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,960
These people,
who wanted nothing

235
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,529
but the animals running around
in the forest,

236
00:09:55,596 --> 00:10:00,033
brought colored beads, images of
the flowers that we live with,

237
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,769
and the plants and the trees.
