- Arne Martinson: There are
thousands of different types

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,939
of mushrooms in Wisconsin.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,742
It's an incredibly diverse area.

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:09,910
My name is Arne Martinson.

6
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:14,781
I am a amateur mycologist
from northern Wisconsin.

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,620
A mycologist is someone
who studies mushrooms.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,388
Beautiful <i>Amanita muscaria.</i>

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,857
This is kinda, like, the most
famous mushroom in the world.

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,059
This is the mushroom emoji
in your phone.

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,227
I love mushrooms.

12
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,631
I've spent the better part
of my life studying

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,268
and trying to understand them
better.

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,607
My property is a great spot
for mushrooms.

15
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:41,775
Welcome, everyone.

16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:42,976
I will be your guide today.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,178
What is a mushroom?

18
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,347
Mushrooms are the fruiting body
of fungi,

19
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,485
so they're essentially just
the reproductive part of fungi.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,554
And, of course,
there's many delicious ones,

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,855
many poisonous ones.

22
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:59,493
Now we can get in the woods
and find the good stuff.

23
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,332
Some of 'em turn bright colors
when you cut 'em open,

24
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,501
some of 'em bleed milk

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,238
and all sorts of crazy,
crazy features.

26
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,882
- Forager 1: Wow!
- Forager 2: Oh, that's pretty.

27
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,917
Is that a...?
- Arne: It's a web cap,

28
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,652
a <i>Cortinarius.</i>

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,888
These are cool.

30
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,623
These are little coral mushroom.

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,791
They're beautiful,

32
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,259
and they come in all
different colors.

33
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,760
- Forager 3: Love the
coral mushrooms.

34
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,495
They're so cool.

35
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,497
- I have a hundred favorites.

36
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:42,669
The amethyst deceiver is a
beautiful purple mushroom

37
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,905
that only stays purple
right after the rain.

38
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,507
It's one of those things that
people think

39
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,009
is in the rainforest
or in a far-off place, but no.

40
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,879
There's, all these things
are right here in Wisconsin

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,046
and they're incredible.

42
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,216
You know, there's so many
vibrant colors

43
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,986
and things that you would not
expect to find

44
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,589
in amongst the leaves
in the Northwoods.

45
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,124
This way, sorry for the mud.

46
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,093
It won't be that bad.

47
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,229
This is one of what we call
the waxy caps,

48
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,430
and it's not eaten at all.

49
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,299
In fact, this one's
a PYP mushroom.

50
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,901
So, make you "Poop Your Pants."

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,269
You don't want this mushroom.

52
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,538
But all the waxy caps
are super florescent,

53
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,608
brightly colored, orange
or yellow or red.

54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,812
We're about to be moving
into sort of a rare environment

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,980
for this area,

56
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,650
which is a cedar hemlock
swamp environment.

57
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:34,188
And so we'll see really
unique mushrooms there.

58
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,126
There's a moment where it just
kind of clicks for 'em,

59
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,427
where they realize, like,

60
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,964
"Oh, I've ignored an
entire kingdom on this planet."

61
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,533
And suddenly, they open their
eyes and it's really wonderful.

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,069
- Forager 3: [gasps] Whoa!

63
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,971
- Arne: Oh, here we go.

64
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,472
These are parrot mushrooms.

65
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:57,878
And if you guys like, we can
take a photo of them real quick.

66
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,815
So that is the black parrot
mushroom,

67
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:06,386
and super sought after by
mushroom nerds for its beauty,

68
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,289
and rarely seen because it's
so hard to see 'em.

69
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,958
There's always a surprise.

70
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,326
Every single day,
I find something

71
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,461
that just blows my mind
out in the woods.

72
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,196
It's very cool.

73
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,465
[blue jay calling]

74
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:23,170
This is a fantastic example of
the eastern destroying angel.

75
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,373
But this is one of only two
deadly mushrooms

76
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,574
we have in Wisconsin.

77
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,044
And if we extract it kinda
carefully from the base,

78
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,646
you can see...
- Forager 4: Whoa!

79
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,282
- Arne: ...this beautiful,
beautiful mushroom.

80
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,750
- Forager 5: Oh, my gosh!

81
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,585
- Arne: Isn't that just,
like, gorgeous?

82
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,953
Extremely poisonous though,

83
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,490
so we can leave it behind.
[chuckles]

84
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,096
I had someone the other day
tell me

85
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,833
that they never looked
at mushrooms until my class,

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,902
and now it's all they do
out in the woods,

87
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,171
and they saw a salamander
for the first time.

88
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,407
Ooh, you got a little newt,
look at that!

89
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,608
Beautiful.

90
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,510
This is a salamander or a newt.

91
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,512
Have any of you never seen
one of these before?

92
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,314
- Forager 5: I've never seen
one of these.

93
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,816
- Forager 6: Never seen one.
- Forager 5: Really?

94
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,153
- We talk about the plants,
the wildlife.

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,458
You really get a sense of,
you know, the whole ecosystem.

96
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,528
I just love every minute
in the woods.

97
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,831
It's a dream job to be able
to be in the woods

98
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,268
and to be showing people things
that fascinate me.

99
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,737
I love watching people
experience things

100
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,140
that bring me joy as well.

101
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,442
