- Angela Fitzgerald:
In a sunny Milwaukee loft,

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,374
a class learns new ways to move.

[upbeat disco music]

00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,777
- Terrence Clark:
We advertise ourselves

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,646
as a fitness class.

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,085
But it's really about the
culture, promoting the culture.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,722
We exist to promote Black
culture roller skating.

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:26,693
We exist to teach it to people
that don't know about it.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,230
So that's how Roll Train
got started.

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,635
- Angela: Roll Train
is a roller dance studio

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,838
and organization headed
by Terrence Clarke

12
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,174
and partner Ellen Fine.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,376
- Terrence: Here, we're gonna
teach you how to do it,

14
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,046
how to balance yourself, how to
fall, you know, how to get up.

15
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,682
- Angela: For Terrence,
skating's been an interest

16
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,384
since childhood.

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,187
- Terrence: Johnson's Skate
Palace was on 76th Street.

18
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,557
A lot of times, we didn't have
a ride to the skate rink,

19
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,959
so we would skate all the way
to the rink

20
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,629
and then we'd have to skate
all the way home.

21
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,798
[bright brass music]

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,634
- Angela: But he also knows

23
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,703
the Black culture
skate tradition

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,006
goes back much longer
as a pastime.

25
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,175
And passion.

26
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,376
- Terrence: Skaters have been
skating

27
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,112
since way before the
civil rights movement.

28
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,881
- Angela: During the
civil rights movement,

29
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:24,318
roller rinks were one more
white-dominated space

30
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,353
to fight to integrate.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,923
But the joy that Black skaters
found couldn't be stopped.

32
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,025
- Terrence: And it's always been
like a stress relief,

33
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,994
a way to express themselves,

34
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,296
a way to connect
with community.

35
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,299
- Angela: And it's been a way
to express a unique style.

36
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:43,403
- Terrence: It's a style that
nobody else gave us.

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,838
It's a style we created.

38
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,740
This is really like an art form.

39
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,943
? Whoa, I feel good ?
[funky music]

40
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,346
- Angela: At the heart
of Terrence's skating

41
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,681
is what's called JB style,

42
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,519
named for the dance moves
of musician James Brown.

43
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,188
- Terrence: JB is a lot
of footwork, a lot of stunts.

44
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,824
? Like this ?
[upbeat music]

45
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,427
- Angela: Different
skate communities

46
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,031
have evolved their own ways
of moving.

47
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,600
- Terrence: Every city has
their own little thing.

48
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,203
St. Louis, Atlanta, Detroit.

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,005
- Angela: The different forms
are shown off

50
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,806
at huge skate parties.

51
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,408
- Terrence: People from all
over the country

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,243
are going to these parties.

53
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,546
You go to these parties,
it's nothing but love.

54
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,549
? No one can stop this, stop
this, stop this, stop this ?

55
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,384
- Angela: Back home
in Milwaukee,

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,486
getting respect for these
skating styles

57
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,122
has once again been a challenge.

58
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,858
At Red Arrow Park, Roll Train
led the charge

59
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:41,261
to open up the ice rink
to off-season skating.

60
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,996
- So for 10 years,

61
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,332
going back and forth
with the county,

62
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,901
just to open the gates
so we can skate there.

63
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,504
And they kept giving us many,
many excuses.

64
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,339
- Angela: At last,
Roll Train succeeded

65
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,875
and the gates were opened.

66
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,311
[upbeat funk music]

67
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:02,115
- Terrence: Finally, we got it
activated for roller skating.

68
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,218
That was a long fight.

69
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,453
- Angela: Just one more way
for Roll Train

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,658
to preserve and promote
Black culture roller skating.

71
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,395
- Terrence: A lot of our skaters
at Roll Train are not Black,

72
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:20,000
but they see and they feel
what skating does for them.

73
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,639
We've gotten lots
and lots of stories

74
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,042
about how since they've come
to the class, you know,

75
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,644
their life has changed.

76
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,380
- Angela: Changing lives
and sharing his culture

77
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,716
keep Terrence rolling along.

78
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,553
- As long as I don't stop
moving, I'm gonna keep skating.
