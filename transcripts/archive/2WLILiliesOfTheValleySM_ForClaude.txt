00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,410
- Nancy Jorgensen:
It was May 1977

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,447
when my grandmother, Nana,
led me to her basement,

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,382
past the black iron
cook stove,

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,385
then the shelves of
home-canned beans and beets.

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,787
I sniffed the stale scent
of Wisconsin wood fires

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,490
and the mustiness
of potatoes in storage,

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,360
odors familiar to me
since childhood.

9
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,995
"Come see the lilies,"
Nana said,

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,696
as she leaned
the screen door open

11
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:34,368
and planted one leather shoe
into her shady backyard.

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,370
I was 22 and just married,

13
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,139
but Nana's gardens
still felt like home.

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,607
"Bring that shovel,"
she said.

15
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,010
"We'll dig some
for your new house."

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,312
Nana cultivated
other species too.

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,015
Phlox, daffodils,
violets, pansies.

18
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,384
She coaxed each
into a vibrant melody

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,053
until her country yard
trilled with color.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,588
Every year a new song,

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,792
but her refrain always
lilies of the valley.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,261
Four decades later,

23
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,730
Nana's darlings transform
my spring landscape

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,332
from a dirt
and grass hoedown

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,734
to a frothy white minuet.

26
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,403
Nana has been gone
many years,

27
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,706
but her lilies
still sing and sway.

28
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,076
Nurseries call them
a high-maintenance plant,

29
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,779
but Nana considered their
spreading a virtue.

30
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,914
Their duty in life,
like hers,

31
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,950
to place roots,
scatter beauty,

32
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,286
and pass gifts
onto a new generation.

33
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,789
Lilies of the valley
thrive in shade.

34
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:32,092
As a woman of the 1920s,
so did Nana.

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,396
Her list of chores cast
long shadows over each day.

36
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,867
Wife and mother was not her
first choice of vocation.

37
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,936
Many years ealier,
she dreamed of an education

38
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,038
and a life devoted
to healing.

39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,875
"I always wanted to be
a nurse," she said.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,811
Instead, she lived like
neighboring farm wives,

41
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,346
in her husband's shadow,

42
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,216
reflecting warmth
and light toward him.

43
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,486
Like Nana, lilies
of the valley rise early

44
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,055
and bloom in the dawn
of summer.

45
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,458
Slender columns strut low
to the ground,

46
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,294
each boasting up
to a dozen tiny flowers.

47
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,364
Pure white,
only millimeters across.

48
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,900
Lilies of the valley
symbolize rebirth,

49
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,869
purity, youth,
and happiness.

50
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,306
But Nana delivered them
to the grave of her son,

51
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,408
a sailor in the U.S. Navy,

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,912
and later her husband,
who died at only 59.

53
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,146
And then another son,

54
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,515
whose heart suddenly
gave out.

55
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:33,153
In life's valleys, her
lilies intoned a requiem.

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,955
My 30-something daughters

57
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,391
inherited Nana's love
of gardening.

58
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,493
Gwen,
a professional athlete,

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,662
sows kale,
plants parsley,

60
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,097
and nurtures her bed
of mint.

61
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,465
Elizabeth buys seedlings

62
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,700
from her
high school students,

63
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,936
who grow them in biology.

64
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,138
For my daughters,
planting is play.

65
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,739
The stakes are low.

66
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,509
If their gardens produce,
they make a caprese salad

67
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,879
or add chives to lettuce
from the farmer's market.

68
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,214
They have none
of Nana's worries

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,015
about climate's
uncontrollables,

70
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,451
like rain, sun, drought,
cold, or heat

71
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,088
that could result
in hungry children.

72
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,095
Two generations
on either side of me,

73
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,231
relishing the wonder
of a seed,

74
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,732
the beauty in a bloom,

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,235
the gratification
of growing.

76
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,937
Nana's gardens
became her vocation.

77
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,173
She buried regrets
and tended her plants

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,376
as she would've
tended patients.

79
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,045
My daughters garden
at their leisure,

80
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,014
free to pursue
their callings:

81
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,550
teacher and writer,
professional athlete,

82
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,186
or nurse,
if they so choose.

83
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,389
