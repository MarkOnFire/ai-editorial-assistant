00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:04,379
The Wisconsin Historical Society
painting is a copy of the most famous

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,797
image of George Washington.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,592
That painting was done in 1796
by the artist Gilbert Stuart.

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,846
Stuart painted Washington from life
three times during the period

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,849
from 1795 to 1796.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,519
This was toward the end of 
Washington's second and 
final term as president.

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,772
The second of these paintings
ultimately resulted in this portrait.

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,860
It is arguably the most famous
and recognizable image of any figure

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,278
from American history.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,990
It's sometimes called the Atheneum
portrait because for many years

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,868
it was owned by the 
Boston Atheneum Library.

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,204
Lots of artists made copies of 
Stewart's paintings over the years,

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,459
including Thomas Sully, who painted
the one in the Historical Society.
