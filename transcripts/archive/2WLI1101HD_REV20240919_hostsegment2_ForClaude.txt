1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:04,083
- I am enjoying
the sights, sounds, and tastes

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:06,834
here at
the Zócalo Food Park.

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,750
[energetic instrumental]

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,500
Before digging in,
I sat down to chat

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,709
with co-owner
Jesus Gonzalez

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:17,500
to learn more about how
the idea of this food park

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,792
was cooked up.

8
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,083
- Jesus Gonzalez: I decided
to start a little food business

9
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:21,999
out of a food truck.

10
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:23,458
And through that first year
of being open,

11
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,709
I started to meet other
food entrepreneurs in our city.

12
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,250
[clapping high five]

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,999
And I realized
there is a vibrant community,

14
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,875
but we just don't have
this location, this plaza

15
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,709
where we can all
come together and grow.

16
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:37,375
- Angela: That seed of an idea
grew into a thriving business,

17
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:41,709
uplifting food entrepreneurs
while building community

18
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,999
in this historic neighborhood.

19
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,709
- We're in Walker's Point,
which is--

20
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:49,208
To me, it's almost like
the Ellis Island of Milwaukee

21
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,834
because there's been
so many immigrant groups

22
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,000
that have come through
this neighborhood.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,542
Most recently, we've had
an influx of Hispanics

24
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:57,709
come into this neighborhood,
Latinos.

25
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:00,625
- So, can you tell us about
that incubator space model

26
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,333
that you all use?

27
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,250
- Nowadays, if you
wanna start a restaurant

28
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,999
or a food concept,

29
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,999
you're looking almost
at about half a million

30
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:10,083
to a million of investment
to go that route,

31
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,583
but if we can provide
someone a food truck,

32
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,542
they can start their business
for about

33
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,250
anywhere from
$20,000 to $40,000.

34
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,917
- Big difference.
- Big difference, right?

35
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,709
So, it just, it opens up
the playing field.

36
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,709
- So, that increases access,
like you said, to ownership,

37
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,999
having your own.
- Absolutely.

38
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,208
- So, is that reflected,
that spirit,

39
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,166
in the diversity
of the participants you have

40
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,166
within this food truck park?

41
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,709
- Definitely; I mean,
we have such an array

42
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:35,750
of diverse offerings.

43
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,750
It's the fabric that makes
this country, right?

44
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,999
I mean,
this is Milwaukee.

45
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:41,917
When you come to the Zócalo,

46
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,999
you see the different faces
that makes Milwaukee
"Milwaukee."

47
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,792
- Woman: [Inaudible],
por favor?

48
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,917
- Angela: It was time
to celebrate

49
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:52,083
the different flavors
of Milwaukee.

50
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,291
- We're here for a pickup.

51
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,583
- Angela: Starting off with...
pizza.

52
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,083
- Nice and crispy.
- Angela: Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:58,999
- Great mushrooms.

54
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,667
It's awesome!
- This is really good.

55
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,083
- The arroz con gandules,
which is very traditional,

56
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,999
the pernil,
and then, the tostones.
- Mmm!

57
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,291
So, do you eat everything
together or...

58
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:09,999
Is that the intention?

59
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,834
- Listen, it's all fair game.
[Angela laughing]

60
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,709
- I just wanna say
compliments to the chef.

61
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,208
- This is our Sandu,
our incubator for the year.

62
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,125
- Oh, really?
Very nice.

63
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,208
- Let's take the first bite

64
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,542
- It's delicious
without being, like,

65
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:31,125
overpowering
with the spiciness level.

66
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:31,999
Very, very good.

67
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,875
- Ernesto: I can eat this
all day.
- Mm-hmm!

68
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,959
Okay, so we have some delicious-
looking Mexican street corn.

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,792
- Mexican street corn, yes.

70
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,709
This was actually prepared
by my mom.
- Aw!

71
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,542
Mm, this is good.

72
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,291
Shout out to your mom.

73
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,125
Very, very good.

74
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,375
Thank you for the introduction
to all the amazing foods

75
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,583
you all have here at Zócalo.
- Thank you!

76
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,375
I'm glad you came by,

77
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,083
met all these cool
food entrepreneurs,

78
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,500
and hopefully,
you come back soon.

79
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,208
- Absolutely,
definitely coming back.

80
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,291
- Cool, awesome.
- Thanks.
