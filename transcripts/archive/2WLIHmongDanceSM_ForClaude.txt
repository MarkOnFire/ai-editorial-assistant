When I was four years old,
I started Hmong dancing.

And I just
never stopped dancing.

Hmong dancing is really defined
by where we came from,
different regions.

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,208
So, there isn't a specific type
of Hmong dancing,

21
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,792
but it was inspired by,
like, Thai and Lao dancing.

22
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,083
So, if you notice,
in traditional Hmong dancing

23
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,375
that sometimes
our hand movements

24
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,750
are similar
to Thai and Lao dancing.

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,083
But then, we also incorporated
Chinese dancing

26
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,250

One of the main people that

00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:28,458
is definitely my dad

in Hmong community.

And then, when I turned 13,
my dad passed away.

37
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,999

always telling us, like,

I think that when you
Hmong dance so much,

45
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,999
you really
learn the language,

46
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,875

to appreciate

that people
put into music

and perform in those dances.

as when the song's talking about

"Oh, we used to
live like this."

53
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,291
And then, we, as the dancers
reenact those movements.

54

So then, we can see
how our parents once lived.
