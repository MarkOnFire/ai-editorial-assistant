PBS Wisconsin Education

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,071
leverages the power
of public media

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:07,708
to spark curiosity and ignite
learning in Pre-K settings

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,543
through 12th grade.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,945
Educational media can help
build skills

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
that students need
to be successful.

7
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:18,452
PBS KIDS content and activities
enhance school readiness

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,021
and support children to reach
their full potential

9
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,090
in school and in life.

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,793
We also deliver award-winning
educational media

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,464
for elementary through
high school classrooms.

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,666
Our media is aligned
to state standards,

13
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,902
and our locally-produced content
is designed

14
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,205
for and with Wisconsin
educators.

15
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,909
We offer powerful and practical
professional learning

16
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,413
to support educators in
activating all PBS resources,

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,249
and we empower students
to make their own media

- Narrator:
Electa Quinney was heartbroken

24
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,943
to leave her home.

25
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,712
She was barely
ten years old,

26
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,281
and she
and five other Mohican girls

27
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,084
were going far away to school.

28
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,686
It would be a long time

29
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,822
before they would
see their families again.

30
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,524
But they knew that education

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,660
was their best chance
at surviving.

32
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,329
To understand why,

33
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:40,367
we have to go back to the years
before Electa was born.

34
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,102
[dramatic music]

35
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,711
Electa and her family
were Mohicans.

36
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,114
The Mohicans lived
in a thriving community

37
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,184
in the state
now known as New York.

38
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,919
But by the 1700s,

39
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,022
more and more European invaders
were coming to America

40
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,658
to seize land and resources.

41
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,661
Colonization, war,
and European diseases

42
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,498
decimated the Mohican
populations and homelands.

43
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:15,836
In order to survive, the
Mohicans were forced to move.

44
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,504
In the 1730s,

45
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,707
they decided to live alongside
some English colonists

46
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:25,812
and form the town that became
Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

47
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,814
There,
the Stockbridge Mohicans

48
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,651
raised families,
farmed and hunted,

49
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,420
and participated
in town life.

50
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,589
When the Revolutionary War
broke out,

51
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,525
the Stockbridge Mohicans
fought alongside the colonists

52
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,527
against the British.

53
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,463
The American colonists promised
to let them keep their lands

54
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,300
in return for this service.

55
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,102
But after the war,
they broke this promise

56
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,838
and forced
the Stockbridge Mohicans

57
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,540
off their land
and out of their homes.

58
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,275
Again.

59
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,477
Another tribe, the Oneida,

60
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,780
offered the Stockbridge Mohicans
a place to live

61
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,281
in New York State.

62
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,618
So, they moved there and started
rebuilding their community.

63
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,822
They called their new home
New Stockbridge.

64
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,759
In 1797, several
Stockbridge Mohican families

65
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:18,532
sent their daughters to live and
study with non-Native families.

66
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,933
Over several years,

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,103
the girls learned reading,
writing, and arithmetic,

68
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,339
as well as crafts like knitting

69
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,175
and how to make cheese
and butter.

70
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,510
Their parents explained

71
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,879
that a combination
of Native teachings

72
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,114
with a non-Native education

73
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,883
would help the community
understand

74
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,720
and negotiate
with American colonists.

75
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,690
Doing this would be key
to their survival.

76
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,693
Back in New Stockbridge,

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,196
the girls then shared
what they'd learned.

78
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,899
One of them,
Mary Peters Doxtator,

79
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,502
opened a school
for Stockbridge Mohican girls.

80
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,738
They produced cloth
that they could sell.

81
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,740
The students
would then share their profits

82
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,209
to help care
for the whole community,

83
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,945
an important Mohican value.

84
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,184
Stockbridge Mohicans invested
years building New Stockbridge.

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,853
Sending Electa and the
other girls away to school

86
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,391
was part of their work
to keep this as their home.

87
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,694
But the New York
state government and businesses

88
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:25,032
were working hard to remove all
Native people from the state.

89
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,167
Reluctantly,
the Stockbridge Mohicans

90
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:31,004
were forced to make their most
devastating move yet--

91
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,739
into the unknown.

92
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,642
In the early 1820s,

93
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,911
the Stockbridge Mohicans
began their journey

94
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,280
to the area
that is now Wisconsin,

95
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,515
where they signed a treaty

96
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,352
with the Ho-Chunk and Menominee
for some land.

97
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,555
They could only bring their most
important possessions,

98
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,958
and they had no way of knowing
what life would be like

99
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,427
so far from their homelands.

100
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,363
But the love of their people
was so strong

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,132
that they committed
to doing what was necessary

102
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,934
to ensure a better life

103
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,938
for future generations
of the Mohican Nation.

104
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,274
Electa Quinney
was one of the people

105
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,511
who helped carry
Mohican traditions to Wisconsin

106
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,247
from their homelands
in the east.

107
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:18,552
When she arrived in Statesburg,
now Kaukauna, in 1828,

108
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:23,957
the Stockbridge Mohican
community was busy rebuilding.

109
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,996
That summer, Electa started
teaching in Statesburg.

110
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:33,734
That made her, a Native woman,
the first known person

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,871
to teach public school in the
area that became Wisconsin.

112
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,606
Yes, the first!

113
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,512
She taught reading, spelling,
math, and public speaking

114
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,382
to Native and non-Native
students alike.

115
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,219
Having a Native teacher
at a school open to all students

116
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,620
was an important sign

117
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:58,258
of the Stockbridge Mohicans'
generosity at work.

118
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,028
This was a big responsibility
for Electa,

119
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,796
but she came from a long line

120
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:08,435
of tribal leaders, historians,
diplomats, and educators.

121
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,344
Electa lived out her life
as a cherished Mohican elder

122
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,613
on a farm in the community.

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,784
When she died around 1885,
she could rest

124
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,887
knowing she had done her part
to uplift her nation

125
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,857
in the face
of great obstacles.

126
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,126
Today, the Mohicans in Wisconsin
call themselves

127
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,796
the Stockbridge-Munsee Band
of Mohicans,

128
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,632
and their reservation
is in Shawano County.

129
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,835
They continue to be inspired
by Electa Quinney.

130
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,139
Electa lifted up Native
and non-Native people.

131
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,775
She taught
not only school lessons,

132
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,513
but demonstrated how to build
a better society.

133
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,016
Her generosity
is a defining Mohican value,

134
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,119
one that the Stockbridge-Munsee
Band of Mohicans

135
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,555
are still known for today.

and I keep getting worse
each time that I do draw it.

Here's Duluth, here's La Crosse.

I'm from this little community

government-to-government
relationship

155
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:17,431
with the United States
called sovereignty.

156
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,268
Laws, et cetera, need to take
into account

157
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,770
this concept of sovereignty.

158
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,840
And the treaties
of 1837 and 1842

159
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,346
were basically deeds
to real estate transactions.

160
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,249
You know, I'm sure there was
something a little bit more

161
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,650
than that going on.

162
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,785
We won't debate that here.

163
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,022
When that land was sold
to the United States,

164
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,957
there were easements on it.

165
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,627
The easement was that we
would always have access

166
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,097
to hunting, fishing,
and gathering of the resources

167
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,498
of this land.

168
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:55,402
So we sold the surface and the
United States said, "Great."

169
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,272
Policies change,
some years they like Indians,

170
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,073
some years they ignore them,

171
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,342
some years they try
and get rid of 'em.

172
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:08,081
So back in 1974, here on the
Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation,

173
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,319
there was a lake,
but these young brothers

174
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,523
said that perhaps that the state
really never had authority

175
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,327
to impose state game law
against the Chippewa.

176
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,396
They would remember the
old grandpa stories.

177
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,165
"Grandpa told me that
his grandpa told him,

178
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,202
"he was there when they signed
those treaties.

179
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,305
And the treaties
are our license."

180
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,241
So what they did was
not unlike what Ghandi did,

181
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,577
was not unlike what
Rosa Parks did,

182
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,079
was not unlike what
anyone else did

183
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,715
when they kind of knew
in their heart

184
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,351
that this law was not right.

185
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,523
They went across the imaginary
line here and began spearfishing

186
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,425
and, of course,
they were arrested,

187
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,561
cited for violating
state game laws.

188
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:58,498
Well, to make that story
shorter, in 1983,

189
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,202
a three-judge panel in Chicago
said Grandpa was right,

190
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,204
that these
young Tribble brothers

191
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,841
had indeed stumbled
onto lost rights.

192
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,778
They said, "We think that
the state has been given

193
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,048
"no constitutional authority
for them to impose

194
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,085
"against the Chippewa,
who are the legal inheritors

195
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,753
of these easements."

196
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,023
However, when the court ruled,
they said,

197
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,594
"You know, it's a long time
since 1837 and 1842,

198
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,997
"so what we want you people
to do,

199
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,634
to go argue the scope
of these rights."

200
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,136
There is nothing in the treaties

201
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,540
which say we must use
the technology

202
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,644
that existed
when the treaties were signed.

203
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,381
So the Chippewa can do
anything in terms of methods

204
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:51,218
that are available that doesn't
threaten the resource.

205
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,555
What was concluded was
that wherever

206
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:59,059
any of these resources are
harvested by the general public,

207
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,229
the Chippewa could harvest
their portion

208
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,730
of these resources.

209
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,233
Wherever anybody else can do it,
we can do it.

210
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,603
And the tribal government
understood for the first time

211
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,271
that geez, this is a right.

212

Lost rights.

213
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,809
Rights that were never given up,
were never sold,

214
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,377
were never taken away,

215
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:22,916
but were just usurped by might
by the state of Wisconsin.

- Les Paul:
To begin at the beginning,

227
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,505
I was born in Waukesha,
Wisconsin.

228
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,075
And about the age of seven,
something happened to me.

229
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:26,580
And I became interested in music
and electronics.

230
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,748
I noticed this one fellow

231
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,817
was winding this wire
around this toilet roll,

232
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,020
and I says, "Harry, what
in the world are you doin'?"

233
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,855
He says, "I'm making
a crystal set.

234
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,256
That's the newest thing,
you know."

235
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:40,060
You can hear radio without
no batteries, no nothing.

236
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,396
That led me into electronics
very heavily.

237
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,965
So what I did is I stole my
mother and father's radio,

238
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,934
and I took 'em
using this PA system.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,970
To then, I jabbed
the pickup needle

240
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,972
into the top of the guitar
and turned it on,

241
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,141
started playin' a record
and I played my guitar.

242
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,243
[electric guitar strum]

243
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,313
I put that on a
hollow-bodied guitar.

244
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,849
An unwanted condition developed.

245
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,250
So you've got a string
doin' this

246
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:06,820
and a pickup going up and down
on the top of the guitar.

247
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:11,158
I'm saying, "Hey, only one thing
should move, just the string."

248
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:14,728
No matter what I played
from the early '30s on,

249
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,465
I was totally convinced
I had to pick something

250
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:21,969
close to a
solid-body instrument.

251
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,904
? Somewhere there's music ?

252
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,939
? How faint the tune ?

253
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,908
? Somewhere there's heaven ?

254
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,910
? How high the moon ?

255
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,778
? There is no moon above ?

256

? When love is far away too ?

257
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,382
I went to the Gibson people

258
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,451
and it took me about seven,
eight years

259
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,854
to finally convince 'em that
this is the way to go.

260
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,123
And I said, "Okay,"
and we signed.

264
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:53,333

into the picture.

Up until he really started
experimenting

268
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:06,180
with recording techniques,
the only way you could record

269
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:10,918
was with several mics, live,
on two tracks of tape.

270
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,621
And the entire session had to be
balanced accordingly.

271
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,492
If horns were used and they were
louder than the bass player,

272
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,662
well, that meant you put the
horns farther away from the mic

273
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,096
than the bass player.

274
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:27,734
And after the record was done,
there was nothing to alter it.

to the 1890 Dairy Bowl,

315
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,895
presented by the
Wisconsin consumers.

316
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,898
We're here in beautiful
Madison, Wisconsin.

317
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,969
The future of the world's dairy
industry is on the line.

318
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,505
We're gearing up to watch
the final minutes

319
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:48,709
of this epic battle between the
Wisconsin Honest Farmers

320
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,444
and the Cheaters.

321
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,913
Let's take a moment to look
at the action

322
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,882
from the game so far.

323
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,919
In the first two quarters,
Wisconsin Honest Dairy Farmers

324
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:01,688
were controlling the field,
but they've been losing ground

325
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,725
ever since the game-changing
play in the third quarter

326
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,828
when they were stuffed
at the production line.

327
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:10,697
That really changed
this game's momentum.

328
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,066
The Cheaters had been
watering down their milk

329
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,502
and selling it
like the real thing!

330
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,871
[crowd gasps]
Real sneaky play.

331
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,974
The problem is the refs,
or anyone for that matter,

332
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,976
just can't see the foul.

333
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,313
Thin milk and the good stuff
look the same

334
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,185
until it's too late and it turns
into a dairy disaster.

335
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,154
Things need to turn around real
quick for the Honest Farmers.

336
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,657
If they can't find a way
to catch the Cheaters,

337
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,259
the dairy industry may never
be the same.

338
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,594
[whistle blowing]

339
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:44,631
Wisconsin Honest Farmers have
called a time out.

340
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,700
Wait, will you look at that!

341
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,036
They're bringing out
a new player,

342
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:53,907
a true agricultural chemist from
the University of Wisconsin,

343
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:55,642
Stephen Babcock!

344
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,846
The original Dairy Dominator.

345
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,050
Not one for the spotlight,
but don't let that fool you.

346
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,386
He has the skills to turn this
whole game around.

347
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,557
This is a wise move by the dean,
a legend in his own right.

348
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,393
Let's see what Babcock's
first play will be.

349
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,029
He's got the line in an
"I" formation.

350
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,131
Babcock appears to be looking
for a method

351
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,467
to separate the fat
from the whey

352
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,804
so people can know
which is the better milk.

353
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,507
This play would be huge
for the Honest Farmers,

354
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,609
but seems like a Hail Mary.

355
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,310
How will he do it?

356
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,312
[flask bubbling]
Babcock takes a flask of milk

357
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,382
from sample A
and readies his machine.

358
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,884
[crowd cheering]
There's Sylvia,

359
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,719
ready for the assist.
[cow mooing]

360
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,088
What a dependable Jersey.

361
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,422
And it's off!

362
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,224
Babcock sets the play in motion

363
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,559
Look at it spin!

364
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,563
Those puffy fat molecules
are in for a heck of a ride.

365
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,900
There they go, separating right
out of the liquid of the milk.

366
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,067
[crowd cheering]

367
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,036
Spinning the milk
reveals the cream.

368
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,640
Farmers can now tell the amount
of butter fat in the milk.

369
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,109
There's no more hiding
the thin milk now.

370
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:05,879
1st and 10, Wisconsin!
[marching band fanfare]

371
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:08,015
But the game's not over yet.

372
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,050
There's still a little time
left on the clock,

373
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,619
and Babcock needs to move
his team quick.

374
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:16,323
He has to make that same play
for every type of dairy cow

375
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,025
to clinch this game.

376
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,359
He better hurry.

377
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,628
The longer he waits, the worse
it is getting out there

378
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,463
for the Honest Farmers.

379
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,133
Fans are losing faith
in dairy as we speak.

380
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,202
The clock is ticking.

381
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,470
Uh-oh, looks like the dean

382
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,339
is calling for a
hurry-up offense.

383
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,241
Babcock's not going
to like that.

384
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,676
The dean is pushing Babcock

385
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,445
to get his test out
onto the field.

386
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,847
That's a risky move.

387
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,782
If Babcock's test
isn't foolproof,

388
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,551
those Cheaters could regain
control of the game.

389
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,954
And with more dairies popping up
in Wisconsin

390
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,057
and across the globe,
the results of this game

391
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,926
are more important than ever.

392
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,763
Looks like the dean is giving
Babcock one more shot

393
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,265
to call the play.

394
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,634
Sylvia's the only cow left!

395
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,202
Can they do it?

396
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,204
Babcock is pulling out
the stops.

397
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,607
He has all his tools in place.

398
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,041
Here comes the snap.

399
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,576
The machine is off!

400
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:14,248
It's spinning, spinning,
spinning, spinning!

401
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,651
The cream is headed straight
for the flask's end zone!

402
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,553
I can't believe it!

403
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,022
Babcock in for the score!

404
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,024
What an amazing play!

405
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,626
[marching band fanfare]
[fireworks exploding]

406
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,195
That is one for the
history books.

407
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:31,465
The dairy industry will never
be the same.

408
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,767
The crowd is going wild.

409
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:37,037
Babcock created a machine
that efficiently

410
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:41,542
and accurately finds the amount
of butter fat in milk.

411
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:46,079
That play will forever be known
as the Babcock test.

412
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,816
A true team player,
Babcock works not for praise,

413
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:52,719
but for the good of humanity.
[crowd cheering]

414
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:53,887
But wow!

415
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,857
What a list of accomplishments!

416
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,859
Confidence in the dairy industry

417
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,496
has been restored
for years to come.

418
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:06,200
[upbeat folk music]

419
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:16,543
[lively string music]

420
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,050
[cheerful music]

421
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,052
- Narrator: Have you ever
flipped over a plastic bottle

422
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,955
and seen a triangle
with a number on the bottom?

423
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,658
That little number is a clue
to the story of Milly Zantow,

424
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,795
a Wisconsinite
whose ingenuity and activism

425
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:38,198
changed recycling
all over the world.

426
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,767
When Milly heard that
the landfill in Sauk County

427
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,837
was going to close early,
she was worried.

428
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:47,140
It was only five years old,
and it was already almost full!

429
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,776
Even worse, toxic chemicals
from the garbage

430
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,411
were leaking into the ground.

431
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,482
What's more, another landfill
might not be ready for years!

432
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,551
Where would all the garbage go?
[garbage falling]

433
00:21:57,618 --> 00:22:01,221
And why were people making so
much trash in the first place?

434
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:05,392
So Milly went to the landfill
and started investigating.

435
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,995
She noticed the trucks
coming and going,

436
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:12,165
dumping lots of things,
but mostly, she noticed plastic.

437
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,701
Plastic, plastic, plastic!

438
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:17,171
Milly knew
a bit about plastic--

439
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,373
how more and more things
were being made with it,

440
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,942
and how much of it
was being used for packaging--

441
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,077
stuff that people
were using just once,

442
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:26,013
then throwing away!

443
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,649
She also knew that
plastic would not decompose

444
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,717
for a long, long time.

445
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,687
Hundreds of years!

446
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,889
Something needed to change.

447
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:38,825
Milly had grown up on a farm
during the Great Depression.

448
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:41,195
Her family made good use
of everything they had,

449
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:45,566
and when something was used up
or worn out, they repurposed it.

450
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,568
She was as thrifty as they came,

451
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,604
and all this waste
didn't make sense to her.

452
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:53,006
She knew some things
were already being recycled.

453
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,741
Why not plastics?

454
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,177
Milly went to the county board
and told them

455
00:22:57,244 --> 00:23:00,647
they should recycle the plastic
waste going into the landfill,

456
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:04,418
but they said they couldn't
because they didn't know how.

457
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,019
She thought back
to the plastic items

458
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,422
she saw being dumped
into the landfill.

459
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,724
Many of them were milk jugs.

460
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,127
So she called up a Milwaukee
milk company with a question:

461
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,462
[phone rings]

462
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,498
- Milly: "What happens if
there's a defect in a milk jug?"

463
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,501
- Manufacturer: "Well, we just
melt down the jug

464
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,302
and blow it again."

465
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,404
- Narrator: Milly also went
to local plastics companies

466
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,607
and asked if
they could use recycled plastic

467
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:27,908
to make their products.

468
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,043
They told her
it wasn't that easy.

469
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,812
There were many different types
of plastic

470
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,481
mixed together in the garbage,
but those different types

471
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,251
couldn't be melted together
to make something new.

472
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:40,521
The plastic waste needed to be
sorted, cleaned, and ground up

473
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,556
for companies
to be able to use it.

474
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,491
And who was going to do that?

475
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,228
[whooshing]
Milly knew what she had to do:

476
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:50,364
save the landfills
from overflowing

477
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,134
and save the Earth
by recycling plastic.

478
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,836
She went to the
nearby university

479
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,237
to learn how to do tests

480
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:00,240
to tell the different types
of plastic apart:

481
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,876
Scratch tests!
- Milly: Oh!

482
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,446
- Narrator: Float tests!
[splash]

483
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,182
- Milly: Ah-ha!

484
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,152
- Narrator: Burn tests!
[plastic burns and sizzles]

485
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,787
- Milly: Oh!

486
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:17,858
- Narrator: Smoke tests!
[smoke poofs]

487
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,727
- Milly: Ohh...
[triumphant music]

488
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:21,929
- Narrator: Milly also knew that

489
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:24,164
she would need a way
to grind all that plastic

490
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,766
so it could be used.
- Milly: Hmm...

491
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,167
- Narrator: She needed
a big grinder,

492
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,402
an expensive grinder,

493
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,438
and more than that,
she needed help.

494
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:34,041
She turned to her friend
Jenny Ehl.

495
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:37,911
- Jenny: "Where are
we going to get $5,000?"

496
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:41,682
- Milly: "Well,
what about our life insurance?"

497
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,884
- Narrator: Milly and Jenny
cashed in their policies,

498
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:46,520
hopped in a truck,
and drove to Chicago.

499
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,022
[gentle folk music]
[truck horn beeps]

500
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,858
They hauled their grinder
back to Wisconsin

501
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:52,626
and got to work.

502
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:56,296
They started E-Z Recycling
in 1979.

503
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:57,764
Their business was all about

504
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,800
making change
in their community--

505
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:03,670
getting people to join them
in a recycling revolution!

506
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,739
Even the students
from nearby schools helped

507
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,642
by collecting plastic items
to be recycled.

508
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,810
Word kept spreading

509
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:12,346
and soon spilled over
into other communities.

510
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:14,481
The recycling revolution
was growing!

511
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,750
[popping]
But the work was hard,

512
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:18,852
and much more
than they could do themselves.

513
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,354
They knew they needed
a better solution

514
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,923
to make recycling
something everyone could do.

515
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,392
The main thing
was all that testing.

516
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,828
What if there was a way
to tell the plastics apart

517
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:30,531
without all that extra work?

518
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:31,698
They put their heads together

519
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:34,268
and came up with
a brilliant but simple idea:

520
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:38,405
a number for each of the
different types of plastic!

521
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:41,275
Manufacturers could stamp
this number into the plastic

522
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:45,379
so that anyone, anywhere
could sort and recycle!

523
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,381
It took years of work
for it to catch on,

524
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,849
but they didn't give up.

525
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,350
Even after the numbering system

526
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,286
started to get used
around the world,

527
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,655
Milly knew there
was still more to do.

528
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,591
It wasn't just about
adding a number to a bottle.

529
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,160
It was about changing
people's beliefs and actions,

530
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,795
and showing them how recycling

531
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,798
would help people
and the environment.

532
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:07,935
She helped with the writing
of Wisconsin's recycling law

533
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,136
and she kept talking with people

534
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,838
about the importance
of recycling

535
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,006
everywhere she went.

536
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,175
By seeing a problem
in her community

537
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,879
and rallying people around her
to find solutions at every turn,

538
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,815
Milly changed Wisconsin
and the world.

539
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,717
Milly's story is just the start.

540
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,252
There is still too much waste

541
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,487
and not enough
reusing and recycling,

542
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,189
which means there are
new opportunities

543
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,058
for innovators just like you

544
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,927
to help make the world
better for everyone!

545
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,496
What do you notice
in your community?

546
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:37,965
What will <i>you</i> do?

547
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:39,700
