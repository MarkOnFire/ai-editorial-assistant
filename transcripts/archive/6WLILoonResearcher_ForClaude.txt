1
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:06,373
I've always

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,775
been enchanted by loons.

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,345
I love loons,

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,547
I love being outdoors.

5
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,293
And this year, it's
about 105 pairs

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,929
that we follow, most of whom
we've marked in previous years.

7
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:32,165
Some of them
we marked back in the 90s.

8
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,968
There projections that loons
will disappear from Wisconsin

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,704
in the next several decades.

10
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,076
I don't want to let loons

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,945
slip away in northern Wisconsin,

12
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,513
or at least
I want to do everything

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,549
I can to try to keep them here
because they're

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,086
beautiful animals
and they've given me so much.
