The following program

00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:06,073
is a PBS Wisconsin
original production.

00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,611
- Angela Fitzgerald: Coming up
on <i>Wisconsin Life:</i>

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:16,483
We return to Ashland to see how
a world record attempt is going,

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,254
then meet a researcher
in Tomahawk studying...

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,789
[loon calling]
...loons,

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,861
a Ho-Chunk artist blending
tradition and innovation,

8
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,431
and we share an animated story
of a grandmother's devotion

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,934
to her family and flowers.

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,337
That's all ahead
on <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

[bell ringing]
- Parent: Oh!

22
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,650
Hi!

23
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,587
- Angela: Once upon a time,
there was an enchanted garden

24
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,056
full of books that come to life.

25
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,124
It's called Bookworm Gardens,

26
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,994
and we're exploring it today
on <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

27
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,531
I'm your host and garden guide,
Angela Fitzgerlad.

28
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,633
This sprawling green space
in Sheboygan

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,504
welcomes visitors
May through October.

30
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:49,510
Enter the garden to inch by inch
through the caterpillar.

31
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,880
Is it Cloudy with a Chance
of Meatballs?

00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,152
Or just touch, read, or play!

35
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,023
Garden Founder Sandy Livermore
had the vision

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,159
to create a space
immersed in storytelling

37
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,395
and opened the gates in 2010.

38
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,131
And it's continued to grow
since.

39
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:14,535
Now, the nonprofit
has a yurt classroom,

40
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:19,773
events for adults, and more
than 80 different book gardens.

41
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,580
Taking inspiration
from the Lorax garden,

42
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,050
let's bookmark it here
to travel far and near.

43
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,353
We have many stories
yet to appear.

44
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,424
As we head up to Ashland

45
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,660
to check back in
with a motorcyclist

46
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,729
attempting a world record ride.

47
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,769
- Bridget McCutchen:
I grew up on a farm

48
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,404
in northern Wisconsin.

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,275
I like to joke I was raised
in a field by cows and a dog.

50
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:59,746
Part of it's a joke
and part of it is reality.

51
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,815
- Angela:
In August 2022,

52
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,351
Bridget McCutchen set out
from Ashland...

53
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,586
- Jeff McCutchen: Goodbye,
Bridget!

54
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,387
- Angela: ...attempting to set
a world record

55
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,457
as the youngest person
to circumnavigate the world

56
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,192
on a motorcycle.

57
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,395
[bright guitar music]

58
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,599
- Bridget: I mean,
it's a beautiful world,

59
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,567
and I wanna go see it.

60
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,071
That's a big part of it,

61
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,974
is just wanting to go
see the world.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,208
- Angela: Bridget took with her

63
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,311
an abundance of curiosity
and ambition.

64
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,713
- Bridget: Riding a motorcycle,
to me,

65
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,815
is the best thing in the world.

66
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:39,720
And it gives you a sense
of freedom and independence.

67
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,956
- Angela: Fourteen months later,
[motorcycle revving]

68
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,726
with her newfound freedom
and independence,

69
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,530
Bridget throttled back into the
town where the journey began.

70
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,164
[people applauding and cheering]

71
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,234
- And we're so happy you're here
to celebrate Bridget's return.

72
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,702
- Oh, my goodness!

73
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,905
Okay, well, I'm alive, I'm fine.

74
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,208
I'm excited to rest,
and honestly,

75
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,344
eat food that's very familiar.

76
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,546
- Angela: At the starting line,

77
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,881
no one could have predicted
the outcome.

78
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,483
Least of all Bridget,

79
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,687
who rewatched the interview she
recorded just prior to leaving.

80
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,224
- I think it's going to start
out with completing the trip

81
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,792
and getting the record,

82
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,396
and I would not be surprised
by the end of it

83
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,733
if it is completely different,
because I guarantee you,

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,002
I will not be the same person
when I come back,

85
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,838
and my values would have
changed.

86
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,808
And so, that's gonna change.
[chuckling]

87
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,846
Wow!

88
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,016
[upbeat electronic music]

89
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,988
- Angela: After logging about
50,000 miles

90
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,390
and traversing 45 countries,

91
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,393
Bridget did come back
a changed person.

92
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,195
- Bridget: The riding
for long hours

93
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,064
gave me a lot of time to think.

94
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,199
I think I've become
a lot calmer.

95
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,468
I think a lot of things
don't bother me

96
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,270
the same way they used to.

97
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,005
I am in the desert.

98
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,509
This is the desert I am in.

99
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,612
I feel way more certain of
myself than I did previously,

100
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,914
and I think that's a big,
big deal.

101
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:18,986
So I've stopped for the night,
and this is my camp spot.

102
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,823
- Angela: That's not to say
she wasn't uncertain

103
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,691
or frightened during the trip.

104
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,560
- There were times
when I was scared.

105
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,296
I think fear is very healthy.

106
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,400
It tells you when your
situations are dangerous.

107
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,102
- Angela: When asked
the driving factor

108
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,737
that got her through it all...

109
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,605
[Bridget grunting]

110
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,508
- Bridget: Stubbornness, mostly.
[laughing]

111
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,310
I think that was a huge part
of it,

112
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,778
is once I get ahold
of something,

113
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,348
I'm a hold of it and it's not
going anywhere.

114
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,854
So, I think just holding onto
that idea really kept me going.

115
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,255
[laughing]

116
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,024
- Angela: The gravity
of her accomplishment

117
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,992
is still setting in.

118
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,129
I just thought about that.

119
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,864
Um...

120
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,467
Pretty cool.

121
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,104
Y'know, I'm very happy
I'm going home,

122
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,774
but I'm gonna miss this.

123
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:19,112
I am going to miss this
a whole bunch!

124
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,282
And that I did that
was pretty awesome.

125
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,017
I am in Nepal!

126
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,154
For the rest of the winter,

127
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,657
sort of be figuring out
what I'm doing next.

128
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,628
And, y'know, sort of getting
things done.

129
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,699
I wanna go back
to working on boats

130
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,436
and, like, doing
other stuff like that.

131
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:49,443
I'm not exactly sure,
but I have some things in mind.

132
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,778
No big adventures planned yet.

133
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,780
- Angela: Driven to succeed
on an adventure

134
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,450
that took her to all corners
of the world.

135
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,319
- I am in the forest in Germany.

136
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:08,061
And I really want to inspire
other young women like myself

137
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,197
to ride motorcycles.

138
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,999
- Angela: Mission accomplished,
Bridget!

139
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,268
With an inspiring story that
landed her

140
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:18,071
in the Guinness Book
of World Records.

141

[motorcycle engine roaring]

142
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,613
Next up, we meet
a researcher in Tomahawk

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,151
heading out on the lake
to study an elusive bird.

- Student: There they are, yeah.
- Walter Piper: Good eye.

147
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,076
- Angela: The most
important research

148
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,478
on Wisconsin's iconic loons

149
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,782
happens in the middle
of the night.

150
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,885
- Walter: Just another
routine night on the lake.

151
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,253
- Angela: From early on,

152
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,358
biologist Walter Piper has had
a fascination with loons.

153
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:16,230
- Healthy-looking chick.
[loon chick screeching]

154
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,565
There he is, real fuzzy.

Hasn't gotten adult feathers
in yet.

156
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,041
I've always been enchanted
by loons.

[loon calling]
As a child,

158
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,246
I heard loons out on the lake,

159
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,582
and they were beautiful
to listen to.

161
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,820
- Angela: For more
than 30 years,

162
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,855
Walter has been watching loons

163
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:45,192
during his annual pilgrimage
to northern Wisconsin.

164
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,593
- Walter: I really love
the solitude

165
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,129
of being out on a lake
in a canoe,

166
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,300
watching loons, being
sort of at one with them,

167
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,903
watching them
raise their families.

168

[loon calling]

169
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,506
- Angela: Walter is
a loon behavior

170
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,176
and reproduction specialist.

171
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,179
His observations are providing
new insights.

172
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,747
- When you see loons preening,

173
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,649
after they've done all that
combing of the feathers,

174
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,351
they'll get up and
straighten out their wings

175
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,121
by doing a wing flap.
[wings flapping]

176
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:17,124
- Angela: However, the calls
that echo across the lakes

177
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:21,361
in the Northwoods are still
very much a mystery.

178
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,096
[loon calling]

179
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,404
- Walter: We've only begun
to scratch the surface

180
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,407
about what they're communicating
with their calls.

181
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,509
- Angela: Those familiar
summer sounds

182
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,578
might also fade away.

183
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,646
- There are projections that
loons will disappear

184
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,783
from Wisconsin in the next
several decades.

185
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,953
- Angela: Imagine the
eerie silence on northern lakes

186
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,688
without loons.

187
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,128
- Walter: I'm very, very anxious
about this reproductive decline

188
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,864
that we've seen.

189
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,333
Reproductive success
is way down.

190
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,634
- Angela: This wasn't the case

191
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:05,606
when Walter first started his
loon research in 1993.

192
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,708
- Walter: Back in the
roaring '90s,

193
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,244
half the pairs
would have two chicks.

194
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,813
Now it's about three to one,

195
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,550
one-chick broods
to two-chick broods.

196
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,052
- Angela: That phenomenon
is putting more stress

197
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,888
on Walter's research,

198
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,557
making his work
even more crucial.

199
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,893
- Walter: We're going to three
lakes in the Rhinelander area:

200
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,096
Flannery, Washburn,
and Manson.

201
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,032
[loon calling]
Not too far away.

202
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,901
That's promising.

203
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,738
[owl hooting]

204
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,175
If we're trying to catch chicks,

205
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,278
I'll make a hoot call,
which is what the adults do.

206
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,946
It's like the deer
in the headlights.

207
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,814
If they hesitate
and stay on the surface

208
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,552
and they're not sure,
then we grab them.

209
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,589
[Walter whistling]

210
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,862
Now slow.
[whistling]

211
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,165
[splashing]

212
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,101
- Angela: The team will take
the loons to shore

213
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,137
to quickly conduct
their research

214
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:13,073
before releasing them back
into the wild.

215
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,675
- Walter: We weigh both adults
and chicks

216
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,009
when we capture them.

217
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,845
That's an important
measurement that we make.

218
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,880
And what we've noticed is that

219
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,115
chick mass has declined
substantially.

220
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,450
- Angela: Walter has a theory

221
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:27,187
on why chick mass continues
to decline.

222
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,656
- Walter: Loons
are visual predators.

223
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,059
Loons have to be able to see
their food to catch it

224
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,827
and to feed it to their chicks.

225
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,496
So, water clarity suddenly
came onto our radar.

226
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,966
And every time the satellite
passes overhead,

227
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,503
we can see, how clear
is the water in this lake?

228
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,638
Water clarity
in northern Wisconsin

229
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,707
had declined on average,

230
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,876
and this meant that
the overall decline

231
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:53,180
had an enormous impact on loons,
we realized.

232
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,386
- Angela: Another threat:
an explosion of black flies.

233
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,421
- Walter: That's related
to rainfall,

234
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,725
almost certainly related
to climate change.

235
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,860
We've had some almost complete
wipe-out years,

236
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:11,765
where all May nests that
loons attempt are wiped out.

237
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,867
Loons are just overwhelmed
by black flies.

238
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:18,338
There are thousands around them,
and they abandon the nest.

239
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,240
- Angela: The emerging danger
to loons

240
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,477
is playing out
in Walter's research.

241
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:27,581
- This year, it's about
105 pairs that we follow,

242
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:29,850
most of whom we've marked
in previous years.

243
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,919
Some of them, we marked
back in the '90s.

244
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,589
Okay, so this bird is green
over copper cream.

245
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:37,257
- Angela: Walter is
very familiar

246
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:41,461
with the loons here
on Manson Lake in Oneida County.

247
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,797
- Walter: The male is
an 11-year-old male.

248
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,066
The female is from Vilas County.

249
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,868
These are both adults
banded as juveniles,

250
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,336
so they're especially
valuable to us

251
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:50,971
'cause we know their age
exactly.

252
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,506
We also know their
natal origins,

253
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,943
so we can learn a lot about
their behavior and ecology

254
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,345
throughout their lives.

255
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,651
- Angela: On this night,
Walter captures their chick

256
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,955
and brings it to shore
for banding.

257
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,826
Despite the trends,

258
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,263
this baby loon
is defying the odds.

259
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,431
- Walter: Got it?

260
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,032
- Allie: Oh, that is
a big chick.

261
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,234
- Walter: A big old chick.

262
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,236
I know, a little nipper too.

263
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,238
He's our biggest one by far
this year.

264
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,541
- Angela: The chick weighs in
at more than 10 pounds.

265
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,444
- It's almost certainly a male,
to be that large this young.

266
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:32,479
It's about something
like eight weeks old.

267
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,214
It's just huge.

268
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:40,387
Okay, that's good.

269
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,356
Pretty, pretty big.

270
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:48,362
Okay, back in the box he goes,
before he nips me to death.

271
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:52,966
So, a very successful night.

272
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:57,504
All right, get them back
to where they belong.

273
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,739
We breathe sigh of relief

274
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,008
when we catch a big,
healthy chick like this

275
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,510
because it means that it's been
well fed.

276
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,913
That says good things
about Manson Lake.

277
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:11,318
It made us feel good to see such
a big, strapping male chick.

278
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,221
- Angela: It's hard not to see
the heartfelt connection

279
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:18,425
Walter has with these loons.

I love being outdoors.

281
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,499
I don't want to let loons
slip away in northern Wisconsin,

282
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,501
or at least I wanna do
everything I can

283
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:29,770
to try to keep them here because
they're beautiful animals

284
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:32,506
and they've given me so much.

with Elizabeth Wieland,

291
00:14:55,996 --> 00:15:00,200
Executive Director of the
nonprofit botanical garden.

292
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,368
- Elizabeth Wieland:
Bookworm's mission

293
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,238
is to inspire the love of books
and nature

294
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,273
in the young and young at heart.

295
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,908
When you think about our mission

296
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,210
and you think about young
and young at heart,

297
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:14,381
I really believe that we have
an incredible experience

298
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,484
and inspiration for people
of all ages here on this site.

299
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,921
I love it when there are
families here and children here.

300
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,790
I also love it when there are
adults without children

301
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,792
and older individuals.

302
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,195
That's really important to us
that we have both.

303
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,763
- Parent: There we go!

304
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,164
- Elizabeth: In many
of our exhibits,

305
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,499
they play with scale,

306
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:36,436
so you get to feel like you are
either incredibly small

307
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,939
or incredibly large.
[child exclaiming]

308
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,341
- Can you tell us more about the
spaces in the gardens?

309
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,410
- Gosh, there are so many
spaces.

310
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,978
So in each site,

311
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,715
we've taken the book and then
interpreted it in some way.

to observe and ponder

316
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,892
and think about.

317
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,494
- So I love the attention
to detail.

318
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,896
Can we go check out some more?
- I would love to!

319
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,631
Let's go explore.

320
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,801
- Angela: We're off to discover
the hidden details

321
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:11,805
found within the Cloudy with a
Chance of Meatballs garden.

322
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:14,074
- So I grabbed the book.
- Oh, okay.

323
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,777
- To show you, because there's
some really special elements

324
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:19,880
in the book that are
in the space.

325
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:22,482
One of them, we looked at the
bread house before,

326
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,119
and here in the book
is the bread house.

327
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,923
[playful music]
[child exclaiming]

328
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,961
So in front of us, these are
berry timeless coral bells.

329
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,363
These are caramel coral bells.

330
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,531
- Angela:
The food-inspired names?

331
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:38,765
- Elizabeth:
The food-inspired names!

332
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,967
That one's a cinnamon fern.

333
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,269
This is the guacamole heuchera.

334
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:46,073
So we really love to add those
details in the garden spaces.

335
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,076
- Thank you, that's interesting.

336
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,211
Each garden is a new book.

337
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,814
- Elizabeth: So the books exist
in these pillars.

338
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,782
They're all laminated
and protected in here

339
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,553
so that you can open the door,
pull out the book,

340
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,589
and then experience the space
right there at your fingertips.

341
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,525
- Angela: I love that.

342
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:08,462
With every book,
a literary world comes to life.

343
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,664
- Elizabeth: So we're in the
area of the gardens now

344
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,832
that's called the farm.

345
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,834
And there are quite a few books
in this section.

346
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,636
One of our very most popular
is this book,

347
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,870
<i>Little Blue Truck.</i>

348
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,872
And you can crawl into the truck
and drive it

349
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,276
and go beep beep beep,
just like the little blue truck.

350
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,478
And we have live chickens.
- Angela: I was gonna say,

351
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,213
I see the live chickens!
- Yep.

352
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,782
And then this is the
Johnny Appleseed tree.

353
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,285
It's pretty cool because it's
genetically connected.

354
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,720
We have the paperwork
to show its lineage

355
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,455
back to an original
Johnny Appleseed tree

356
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:36,790
that was planted here.

357
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,760
But there's lots of gardens here
in the farm.

358
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,829
It's one of our most
popular spaces.

359
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,164
- Thank you so much.

360
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,966
I appreciate your tour
and your time today, Elizabeth.

361
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,568
- It's been so much fun
having you.

362
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,770
Thanks so much, and please
come back and visit us again.

363
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,638
- Definitely will.

364
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,807
[playful music]

365
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,882
We now head to Baraboo,

366
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:04,885
where an artist's creativity
is honoring the past

367
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,088
while bringing people together.

368

- Melanie Tallmadge Sainz:
Being creative

370
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:24,037
is such a healthy way
to engage in one's life.

371
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:28,976
I usually try to start my day
being creative, yeah.

372
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,411
My name is
Melanie Tallmadge Sainz.

373
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,780
I am a creative maker
and artist,

374
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,282
cultural arts presenter,

375
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,884
as well as the
founding director

376
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,087
of Little Eagle
Arts Foundation.

377
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,856
Little Eagle
Arts Foundation,

378
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,925
sometimes we go
by the acronym LEAF.

379
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:48,061
We are a standalone,
Native-run 501c3.

380
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,032
Little Eagle was
my father's Indian name.

381
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,970
Growing up, I was always
around Native art,

382
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:59,573
and it was just kinda,
through osmosis,

383
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,911
it was something that I was
always so inspired by.

384
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,979
You know, it's something
that we as Native peoples,

385
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,681
we've been using the quill
of the porcupine

386
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:11,285
long before the introduction
of the glass bead.

387
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,420
So, like, maybe your grandma
did cross-stitching

388
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,922
or needlepoint or embroidery.

389
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:18,592
She would probably use
a cotton floss, like a thread.

390
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,662
I substitute porcupine quills.

391
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,367
I just have always wanted

392
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:30,137
to capture the portrait
of people

393
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,172
that have been
really important to me

394
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,209
as a human being
and growing up.

395
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,512
To be able to take kinda those,
use of light and darks

396
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,113
in terms of the
tonal qualities

397
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,849
that you see in a face,

398
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,952
and adapt a whole range
of dyed quills

399
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,387
to match up those
tonal qualities,

400
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,922
and then to utilize
the quills

401
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,391
to kinda match up the
mosaic kinda qualities,

402
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,360
almost like pop art.

403
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,664
One of the places that
I get the most inspiration

404
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,766
is just opening
the garage door here

405
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,669
and walking amongst the land.

406
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,004
Doing sketches of,
you know,

407
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:08,008
the flora and fauna
in the area, or the landscape.

408
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,978
Sometimes that can
inspire me.

409
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,449
You can't get any closer to
the connection with the earth

410
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,117
than working in clay,

411
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,219
and I've been
all over the country,

412
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,221
and I've been to different
parts of the world,

413
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,223
Japan and Guatemala
and Spain,

414
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,391
and I'm always looking

415
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,827
for natural sources of clay,
you know.

416
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,364
Because the use
of clay is universal.

417
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,403
The thing I love
about our Native peoples

418
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,041
is they're always so willing
to share and advise.

419
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,843
You know, art has a way

420
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,380
of really bringing people
together.

421
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,149
Good things come
to those who wait,

422
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:51,752
and art, sometimes
it takes a little longer

423
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,787
than anticipated.

424
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:57,524
But I think it's worth it,
in my opinion.

425
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,064
- Angela: Now, we share
an animated story

426
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,834
by Waukesha writer
Nancy Jorgensen,

427
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,336
who reflects on her
grandmother's devotion

428
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:12,673
to her family
and a beloved flower.

429
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,744
[fire crackling]

430
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,915
- Nancy Jorgensen:
It was May 1977

431
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,718
when my grandmother, Nana,
led me to her basement,

432
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,587
past the black iron
cook stove,

433
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,690
then the shelves of
home-canned beans and beets.

434
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,059
I sniffed the stale scent
of Wisconsin wood fires

435
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,695
and the mustiness
of potatoes in storage,

436
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,698
odors familiar to me
since childhood.

437
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,399
"Come see the lilies,"
Nana said,

438
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,868
as she leaned
the screen door open

439
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:45,839
and planted one leather shoe
into her shady backyard.

440
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,641
I was 22 and just married,

441
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,310
but Nana's gardens
still felt like home.

442
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,945
"Bring that shovel,"
she said.

443
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,348
"We'll dig some
for your new house."

444
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,683
Nana cultivated
other species too.

445
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,219
Phlox, daffodils,
violets, pansies.

446
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,588
She coaxed each
into a vibrant melody

447
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,358
until her country yard
trilled with color.

448
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,792
Every year a new song,

449
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,997
but her refrain always
lilies of the valley.

450
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:12,466
Four decades later,

451
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,135
Nana's darlings transform
my spring landscape

452
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:16,537
from a dirt
and grass hoedown

453
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:19,006
to a frothy white minuet.

454
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,574
Nana has been gone
many years,

455
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:23,877
but her lilies
still sing and sway.

456
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,347
Nurseries call them
a high-maintenance plant,

457
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,017
but Nana considered their
spreading a virtue.

458
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,052
Their duty in life,
like hers,

459
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,254
to place roots,
scatter beauty,

460
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:37,658
and pass gifts
onto a new generation.

461
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,160
Lilies of the valley
thrive in shade.

462
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,430
As a woman of the 1920s,
so did Nana.

463
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:47,634
Her list of chores cast
long shadows over each day.

464
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:51,138
Wife and mother was not her
first choice of vocation.

465
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:54,074
Many years ealier,
she dreamed of an education

466
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:56,410
and a life devoted
to healing.

467
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:59,246
"I always wanted to be
a nurse," she said.

468
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:02,082
Instead, she lived like
neighboring farm wives,

469
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,584
in her husband's shadow,

470
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,454
reflecting warmth
and light toward him.

471
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,691
Like Nana, lilies
of the valley rise early

472
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,093
and bloom in the dawn
of summer.

473
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,662
Slender columns strut low
to the ground,

474
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,565
each boasting up
to a dozen tiny flowers.

475
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:22,002
Pure white,
only millimeters across.

476
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,171
Lilies of the valley
symbolize rebirth,

477
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,140
purity, youth,
and happiness.

478
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,544
But Nana delivered them
to the grave of her son,

479
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,613
a sailor in the U.S. Navy,

480
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,116
and later her husband,
who died at only 59.

481
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,417
And then another son,

482
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,953
whose heart suddenly
gave out.

483
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,725
In life's valleys, her
lilies intoned a requiem.

484
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,226
My 30-something daughters

485
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,662
inherited Nana's love
of gardening.

486
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:50,731
Gwen,
a professional athlete,

487
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,799
sows kale,
plants parsley,

488
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:55,068
and nurtures her bed
of mint.

489
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:56,637
Elizabeth buys seedlings

490
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:57,871
from her
high school students,

491
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,040
who grow them in biology.

492
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,509
For my daughters,
planting is play.

493
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:03,944
The stakes are low.

494
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,780
If their gardens produce,
they make a caprese salad

495
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:10,017
or add chives to lettuce
from the farmer's market.

496
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,518
They have none
of Nana's worries

497
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:13,287
about climate's
uncontrollables,

498
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:15,923
like rain, sun, drought,
cold, or heat

499
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,560
that could result
in hungry children.

500
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:26,433
Two generations
on either side of me,

501
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,535
relishing the wonder
of a seed,

502
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,003
the beauty in a bloom,

503
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,472
the gratification
of growing.

504
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,175
Nana's gardens
became her vocation.

505
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,377
She buried regrets
and tended her plants

506
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:40,581
as she would've
tended patients.

507
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:43,183
My daughters garden
at their leisure,

508
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,219
free to pursue
their callings:

509
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,688
teacher and writer,
professional athlete,

510
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:50,324
or nurse,
if they so choose.

511
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,660
[door opening]

512
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:58,932
[gentle music]

513
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,871
- We've huffed and puffed

514
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:07,207
and blew through this episode
of <i>Wisconsin Life,</i>

515
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:11,979
visiting the Bookworm Gardens
and telling our stories.

I'm Angela Fitzgerald,

520

and this is our <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

521
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:28,562
The end!

[gentle music]

523
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:53,921
- Parent: The doggy, are you
getting him nice and clean?

524
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,656
- Child: Yeah!
