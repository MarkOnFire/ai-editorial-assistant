1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,769
- Okay.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,171
Wow, fancy!

3
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,907
Cameras, ooh, fluffy thing.

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,743
Okay, my name is Deayjah.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,911
- My name is Jonathan.

6
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,679
- My name is Martin.

7
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,314
- Angela Fitzgerald:
These teens...

8
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,649
- My name is Yeislin.

9
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,084
- Lia, L-I-A.

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,252
- Angela: ...are seeing...

11
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,520
- My name is Ami.

12
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,088
- Angela: ...behind the scenes.

13
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,322
- You know, learning the magic.

14
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,790
- How the magic works.

15
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,592
Who helps with the magic.

16
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,561
[students talking]

17
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,032
- You guys can come up close
and take a look at these.

18
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,534
When I close these,
they look antiquey,

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,303
but they have snaps, 'cause it's
theater and you gotta be fast.

20
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,639
- Angela: The group is getting
to go backstage...

21
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,241
- He's made of plasterform,
so he's super light.

22
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,078
- Angela: ...above the stage,
and all around the building...

23
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,447
- Vomitorium is Latin
for "hallway."

24
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,217
- Angela: ...at UW-Madison's
theater department

25
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,419
through a program called ACES.

26
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,620
- You are having
to problem-solve

27
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,855
and think on your feet,

28
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,890
and those are huge skills
that you can take

29
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,425
to wherever you're going.

30
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,593
- ACES is the

31
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,962
Arts Careers and Exploration
Spotlight program,

32
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,866
which was started in 2019
at Overture Center.

33
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,334
- Angela: Madison's
Overture Center

34
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,003
is the program's creator
and home base.

35
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,875
But on-site learning happens
on field trips like this.

36
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,512
- My favorite thing about ACES
is getting to explore the arts

37
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,816
and learning that there are
more positions in art

38
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,818
that you get to learn about.

39
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,019
- In addition to doing this,

40
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,721
I'm also the
operations assistant,

41
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,390
so I do a lot
of logistical planning.

42
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,527
I plan all of our in-state tours
and things like that.

43
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,397
- Allowing students to see
that full breadth of careers

44
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,666
that create an arts organization

45
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,903
allows students to be able
to continue to explore,

46
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,672
and also advocate for being able
to stay creative

47
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,908
and in these creative spaces
as well.

48
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,643
[drumming]

49
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,013
- There's this whole, like,
ecosystem of careers

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,716
that you could do that are
involved in the arts.

51
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,784
[gentle piano music]

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,560
- Angela: Heavyn Dyer-Jones
is an ACES counselor.

53
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,396
As a recent UW grad
in piano performance,

54
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,066
exploring arts careers
has immediate resonance.

55
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,068
- I wish that I had a program
like ACES

56
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,070
when I was in middle
or high school to, like,

57
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,908
all the little, like,
subgenres of careers

58
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,409
that you could even have.

59
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,945
- Angela: While Heavyn has the
talent and the training

60
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,914
to be a professional musician,

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,617
she's not sure that's the life
she sees for herself.

62
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,353
- I also have had
a growing interest

63
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,557
in psychology, sociology,
things like that,

64
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:41,762
so I think I'm gonna go to
grad school for music therapy.

65
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,264
[applause]

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,268
Everyone find C, middle C.

67
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,337
Put a finger up
when you've found it.

68
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,774
- Heavyn can use her gifts
and her love of the arts

69
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,475
to continue to help people.

70
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,545
- Yep, that's your next one, and
then this is your last chord.

71
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,913
It's right next door.

72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,251
- The counselors, they're really
passionate about the arts.

73
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,320
[gentle flute music]

74
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,260
- You have
very impressionable youth,

75
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,561
particularly youth of color,

76
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,364
who might not see themselves
represented in the arts

77
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:22,903
in the ways that these amazing
counselors, you know, have.

78
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,708
- Everyone, take a moment,
come gather 'round me please.

79
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,577
- Angela: Hands-on opportunities
led by working artists

80
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:34,214
also add color
to the ACES experience.

81
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,917
- I'm gonna wanna put stars
in the background.

82
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,853
- It can let them imagine
and really let them dream

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,221
what it could be.

84
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,789
- Ooh, that one's a little star.

85
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,992
This one looks like art.

86
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,660
- They give us a really good
opportunity

87
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,730
to be able to see
inside the arts.

88
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,999
- You can always add more.

89
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,667
It's a little bit harder
to take away.

90
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,702
- We got to really meet
cool people.

91
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,005
- Cute!
- Oh, that's so smart!

92
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,506
- So I think meeting
those people

93
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,275
and seeing how inspired
they were,

94
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:06,446
I think is really one of my
favorite parts of the program.

95
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,182
[applause]

96
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,051
- It kinda changed
my perspective.

97
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,554
- Definitely gave me
a different perspective.

98
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,390
I'm a lot more interested
in the arts.

99
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,458
- Angela: From a
different perspective,

100
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,361
new possibilites come into view.

101
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,530
- Just really helped
broaden my eyes

102
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:28,001
to different jobs in the arts
that I could be included with

103
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,736
to help the magic.

104
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,508
- Camera Operator: Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, thank you.
