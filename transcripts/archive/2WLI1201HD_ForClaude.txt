- Hello, and welcome
to <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

22
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,048
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

23
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,817
We're celebrating
the 125th anniversary

24
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,987
of Wisconsin State Parks
at Interstate Park.

25
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:31,058
It's the oldest state park
in Wisconsin, founded in 1900.

26
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,227
Not to be confused
with Interstate State Park

27
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,896
in Minnesota--
our park sits in Polk County

28
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,398
overlooking the Dalles,
the narrow gorge

29
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:43,470
the St. Croix National
Scenic Riverway runs through.

30
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,405
[bright music]

31
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,409
The views from the park
are expansive.

32
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,479
Used as a transportation route
by Indigenous people,

33
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,883
the riverway was later utilized
by loggers.

34
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,720
However, this narrow gorge
caused massive log jams,

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:05,025
most notably an 1886 log jam
estimated to be 7 miles long,

36
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:10,898
only to be cleared by dynamite,
steamboats, and hours of labor.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,268
A few years later, working to
preserve the distinct scenery

38
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,537
and rock formations of the area,

39
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,239
advocates in both Minnesota
and Wisconsin

40
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:23,510
worked to establish
the state parks we see today.

41
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,514
Visitors can also check out the
Ice Age Interpretive Center

42
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,984
to learn more about the glacial
formation that carved this land

43
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,987
and the animals that roamed it.

44
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,391
We'll also <i>roam</i> this park
later in the show,

45
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:41,595
but let's jump
into our first set of stories.

46
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,364
As we head to Shawano

47
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:49,670
to meet a family bottling up
a taste of Wisconsin's past.

48
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,740
[bright music]

49
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,742
If you grew up
in Shawano County,

50
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,745
there's a good chance
you've heard of Twig's.

51
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:02,049
And if you grew up in Wisconsin,
there's an even better chance

52
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,219
your childhood included
Sun Drop soda.

53
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,089
- Dan Hartwig: Sun Drop came out
in the early '50s.

54
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,291
It's the first gold drink,

55
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,628
the golden cola
that was on the market.

56
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,164
- Angela: Dan Hartwig's family
knows a thing or two

57
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,066
about this citrus soda.

58
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,601
Just ask Ben.

59
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,803
- Ben Hartwig: Before Sun Drop
was actually even a soda,

60
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,438
it was considered a lemonade.

61
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,707
And that's why you see them
call it the "golden cola."

62
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,844
And then in 1953, Sun Drop
was introduced to us.

63
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,247
- Most people think that
we invented it,

64
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,750
but actually it was invented
by guy named Charles Lazier

65
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,385
out of St. Louis.

66
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,854
- He asked my grandpa
if he wanted to bottle

67
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,457
and distribute Sun Drop
up in this area.

68
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,894
And it's been our
most popular product since.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,896
- Angela: But in order
to get the full story

70
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,397
behind this bottled beverage...

71
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,733
- Jake Hartwig: Twig's has
a vast history in Shawano.

72
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,035
- Angela: ...you have to go back
three-quarters of a century

73
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,271
to a man they call Twig.

74
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,740
- Ben: My grandpa, Floyd
Hartwig, started the business.

75
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,542
- Diane Hartwig: Twig's was
founded by my father-in-law

76
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,910
in the early '50s.

77
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,614
Then in 1986, my husband and I
bought it from his father.

78
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,683
- I always worked with my dad,

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,785
and I got to know him
as good as anybody.

80
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,620
And we came up with this idea.

81
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,822
- They always called him Twig,
that was his nickname.

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,358
So they decided to call the
business Twig's Beverage.

83
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,494
- Angela: Ever since Twig
started the business,

84
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,497
the Hartwigs have had a heart
for Shawano.

85
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,199
- My father, he grew up
in Shawano,

86
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,533
just like all of us.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,069
It's a great place to live.

88
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,472
- Jake: I'm proud of staying
in a small town,

89
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,274
staying in Shawano, being local.

90
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,210
Twig's gives us that
opportunity.

91
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,612
- Angela: And there's something
else about this area

92
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,547
that Twig's tapped into.

93
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,051
- Yeah, Shawano water,
it's just the greatest water.

94
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,986
There were two big breweries
in town

95
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,922
and maybe three
bottling companies.

96
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,426
These guys came to Shawano
to start their factories

97
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,361
just because of the water.

98
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,130
We actually started
bottling the water.

99
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,466
- Angela: In addition
to water and Sun Drop,

100
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,736
Twig's also bottles
its own brand of sodas.

101
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,239
- We're known for a lot
of our Twig's flavors.

102
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,609
Root beer, black cherry,
blue raspberry.

103
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,878
Those are our
more popular ones.

104
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,313
- People will come in
with 10 to 40 cases

105
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,949
that they'll need refilled,
and they come from all over

106
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,718
with their pickup trucks
and their vans,

107
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:22,789
and they may bring it to their
homes or to their cabins.

108
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,192
- Angela: This family business

109
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,594
occupies a place
in Shawano history.

110
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,962
[Dan laughing]

111
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,799
Today, the Hartwigs' family
is preserving Twig's history

112
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:37,104
one bottle, one case,
and one memory at a time.

113
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,839
- It's unique.

114
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,841
I don't think there's anywhere
like it.

115

- Ben: Over here, you'll see

116
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,144
a lot of different
advertisements that we've had.

117
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,812
It's kinda cool nowadays,
people say, like,

118
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,649
"Oh, yeah, we used to have this
Sun Drop sign on our bar,

119
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,151
restaurant, or grocery store."

120
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,520
- Angela: Twig's is a true sign
of the times

121
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:57,758
that continues to attract
visitors from near and far.

122
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,826
- I think what draws
a lot of people here

123
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,296
is that they want to come
and see live bottling.

124
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,264
[bottles clanking]

125
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,502
- We're the last returnable
bottler for Sun Drop

126
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,803
in the world.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,905
Some individuals like it 'cause
of the nostalgia feel

128
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,106
that it gives
from drinking soda

00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,541
from a glass bottle.

130
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,543
- Angela: For fans of those
glass bottles...

131
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,711
- Seventy-nine.

132
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,513
- Angela: ...they are all
stamped with a date

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,248
when they first hit
the production line.

134
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,583
- Eighty-five.

135
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,651
So those are old ones.

136
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,353
- Angela: Through the years,

137
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,057
the bottom line of bottling
has always been family.

138
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,259
- I love being part of the
family business, you know?

139
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,328
It's great to see
where we've started

140
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,163
and where we've come to now.

141
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,699
- It's something that
I think about all the time.

142
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,069
I'm proud that Twig's has been
able to stay local.

143
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,737
I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

144
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,874
- They say family businesses
are the salt of the earth,

145
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,009
kind of the backbone
of small communities.

146
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,678
And especially in a town like
Shawano, it's very true.

147
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,146
There's nothing else like it.

148
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,615
- I've stayed here all my life.

149
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,384
I've been working here
for 54 years.

150
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:01,054
I don't plan on leaving
unless my boys kick me out.

00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:05,459
I'm proud that they're still
sticking around.

157
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,587
there is something magical.

158
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,390
If I wouldn't have the farm...

159
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,425
Do you wanna give me a kiss?

160
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,828
... I know I wouldn't be the
person that I am today.

161
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,332
I'm Kerri, and I'm the owner
of Eagle Eye Farm.

162
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,634
I was working as a radiologist
in St. Louis, Missouri,

163
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,370
and Dawn, my wife, had been
working in health care

164
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,805
for about 32 years.

165
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,709
And we just decided that the
monotony was too much for us.

166
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:59,780
In August of 2018,
we went to an alpaca farm.

167
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:05,652
We had just wanted to go do
something fun with the kids.

168
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,287
It was pretty shortly
after that,

169
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,689
I'm talking like a day or two,

170
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:12,993
that Dawn and I decided
we wanted to get into alpacas.

171
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,262
[bright acoustic music]

172
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,000
We're right between Hudson,
Prescott, and River Falls

173
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,268
in western Wisconsin.

174
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,003
It's a great area.

175
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,243
So we had 20 alpacas,
we had 2 pigs,

176
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,913
and we had chickens.
[chicken clucking]

177
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,582
We brought in the
Valais Blacknose sheep.

178
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,851
We also purchased two llamas.

179
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,019
We added goats,

180
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:42,122
and then we added
prehensile-tailed porcupines.

181
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,958
And then you have to have
the Highland cattle

182
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,794
because they have
the gorgeous horns.

183
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,231
Dawn had always known that she
had wanted to do agrotourism.

184
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,933
Agrotourism is simply the act

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,468
of having people come
to your property

186
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,670
and showing them
about agriculture.

187
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,472
So Dawn was very adamant

188
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,575
that she wanted people to know
where food came from.

189
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,111
We do not eat any of our animals
that we have here,

190
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:05,946
but she wants kids to know

191
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,948
that you don't just go
to the grocery store

192
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,516
and pick up your food
from there.

193
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:14,755
There's really a whole process
that happens before that.

194
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,925
I think everything just kind of,
just fell into our lap.

195
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,128
It was just as if
it was meant to be.

196
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,965
[pig snorting]

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,377
In 2023, Dawn was at an
alpaca show in Michigan.

198
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,348
She told me when she was there
that she wasn't feeling well.

199
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,984
The feeling did not go away.

200
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,888
And I just said, "So I'm gonna
meet you at Hudson Physicians,"

201
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,356
and she said, "Okay."

202
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,660
And at that point, I knew that
I was in trouble.

203
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,232
They determined that
she was having a heart problem.

204
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:02,135
Ended up eventually at the
university on life support.

205
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,304
Was on life support
for three and a half weeks,

206
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,173
and then passed away.

207
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,116
This farm was really hers.

208
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,652
So she was in charge
of all of the animal care,

209
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,255
taking care of the animals
day by day.

210
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,656
I would take care
of the finances,

211
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,057
I would take care
of the website,

212
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,059
I would take care of the store.

213
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,861
And she did everything else.

214
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,865
And so then, we're stuck with,
I've lost my wife,

215
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,501
I've lost my best friend,
I've lost my business partner.

216
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,638
I am like,
"What am I going to do?"

217
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,841
So I have two kids,
I have the farm,

218
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,876
I'm still working full time.

219
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,946
How am I gonna manage
all of this?

220
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,551
I looked at downsizing,
and really,

221
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,887
the only decision that made
any sense was to stay here.

222
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,455
There you go, bud.

223
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,890
C'mon, let's go get some food.

224
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,326
I knew that my time here
wasn't done.

225
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,461
I still have a purpose here
on the farm,

226
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,997
and I wanted to make it work.

227
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,200
It's the best decision
that I've ever made.

228
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,935
[laughing]

229
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,337
I'm still in the
grieving process.

230
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,873
It's been a year and a half,
almost two years.

231
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,210
It's, I don't like to think
about it a lot,

232
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,612
so I just keep myself busy.

233
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,052
What I do is I wake up somewhere
between 5:30 and 6:00,

234
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,387
and I have two kangaroos
that live in the house,

235
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,022
and so I feed them.

236
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,024
By 7:30, we're out here
doing chores.

237
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,693
So we pick up all of the poop.

238
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,494
You have to make sure
that they have food,

239
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,697
so we give our alpacas pellets.

240
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,667
They have free choice hay, so
we have to refresh their hay.

241
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,269
And then, of course,
fresh water.

242
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,770
[water splashing]

243
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,272
And so, the chores take anywhere

244
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,108
from two, two and a half
to three hours to do.

245
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,776
We do them as a group.

246
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,246
Hopefully, we start having some
visitors that come

247
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,814
and we start doing tours.

248
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,117
And so, yeah,
it stays pretty busy.

249
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,554
I could not do this
without my staff.

250
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,724
So I have really great staff
that work here

251
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,026
that I trust immensely.

252
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,295
I am so appreciative
for the fact

253
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:11,231
that they're supportive of me.

254
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,200
You know,
I can't see myself moving.

255
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,535
I just honestly can't.

256
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,470
You know, I think I'll probably
be here

257
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,605
until I'm no longer here
on Earth.

258
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:22,776
I truly enjoy the experience
of having people around me.

259
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,645
I love the animals.

260
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,214
I find this very fulfilling.

261
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:30,184
[laughing]
That's good video!

262
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,452
It's all about love.

263
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,657
It's all about caring for each
other and caring for nature,

264
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,458
and really doing the best
that we can

265
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,995
for people and animals
and the Earth.

266
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,133
- We're on the trails
at Interstate Park,

267
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,568
on the hunt to learn more

268
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:52,539
about how the Ice Age shaped
this layered landscape.

269
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,643
To do that,

270
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,314
Natural Resource Property
Supervisor Matthew Densow

271
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,083
met me in the Ice Age
Interpretive Center.

272
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,284
- Matthew Densow:
So, Interstate Park

273
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,253
is a very, very unique property
in that

274
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,189
we are the oldest property
in the state of Wisconsin.

275
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,591
We have over 1,300 acres,

276
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,192
and our major feature
that we protect

277
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,727
are the Dalles
at the Saint Croix

278
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,563
and the glacial potholes
that we have here.

279
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,334
We have 82 standard campsites
along with 2 group campsites.

280
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,102
We have a very nice
swimming beach

281
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,504
that's on the
Lake O' the Dalles.

282
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,273
We have over nine miles
of hiking trail within the park.

283
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,774
With the Ice Age
Interpretive Center,

284
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,910
it allows people to kind of
travel back in time

285
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,479
and experience what the area
really kind of looked like,

286
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,715
and then physically going
on the pothole trails,

287
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,784
imagining where the water was
and how the potholes formed

288
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,420
really kind of helps people
transport back in time.

289
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,924
So there's lots to see and do
here at Interstate.

290
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,259
- So, I understand

291
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,995
there are technically
two Interstate Parks.

292
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,730
- So there is a
Wisconsin Interstate

293
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,498
and then there's a
Minnesota Interstate Park.

294
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:52,766
So we're the bigger, better one.

295
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,169
You know, we have more to offer,
more to see and do.

296
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,503
There are some differences.

297
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,338
They're definitely both
good properties to go and visit,

298
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,541
but I'm gonna definitely
advocate for our side.

299
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,075
- I'm all
for friendly competition,

300
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,144
so encouraging everyone
to get outdoors,

301
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,214
and they can option
into the Interstate Park

302
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,482
on the Wisconsin side,

303
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,083
but clarifying
the Interstate State Park

304
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,618
is on the Minnesota side.
- Correct.

305
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,487
- See both, but come here first.

306
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:14,821
- Exactly.
- Okay. [both laughing]

307
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,224
Thanks, Matthew.
- Thanks.

308
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,525
- Angela: So I understand

309
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,160
there's a unique anniversary
taking place this year,

310
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,196
the 125th year of the park.

311
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,797
Can you tell us about that?
- Definitely.

312
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,133
In September 20 of 1900,

313
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,068
the first parcels of land
were purchased here

314
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,403
for Interstate Park.

315
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:33,106
So this year is the 125th
anniversary of Interstate Park,

316
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,442
but also the entire
Wisconsin state park system,

317
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,579
which has grown from Interstate
to 50 state parks,

318
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,280
fifteen state forests.

319
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,750
Fourty-four state trails,
nine recreation areas,

320
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,752
eight water resource areas,

321
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,623
over 6,000 campsites,
1,500 buildings.

322
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,693
It's grown
to what you see today.

323
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,329
- Would you mind showing me
some more about the park?

324
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,496
- Yeah, definitely.

325
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,899
Let's go for a nice little hike.

326
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,602
- Angela: From the center,
we headed to the Pothole Trail

327
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,171
to get a look at the
ancient rock formations

328
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,906
this park offers.

329
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,608
- Matthew: So,
if you can imagine

330
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,244
when everything was melting
with the last glaciation,

331
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,445
there's a whole bunch of water

332
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,014
that was coming
through this area.

333
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,916
Water was coming through
really fast,

334
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,519
and there's lots of things
that got caught in the water.

335
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,421
Some of the ones that we find
are called grinders.

336
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,423
- Oh, wow.
- And this is a small example

337
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,825
of one that we have here.

338
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:27,427
Well, you get a whirlpool
that forms, and then it drills

339
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,196
into the rock itself.
- Oh!

340
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,465
- And that's how we form
glacial potholes,

341
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,736
which we have very fine examples
here at Interstate Park.

342
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,005
So one thing that
makes potholes special,

343
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,406
and you can tell it's a pothole,

344
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,108
is that the surface inside
is smooth

345
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,544
because you can tell
that it's been worn out.

346
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,946
- I now have a more positive
association with potholes

347
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,048
than what I came into this
conversation with.

348
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,216
- Great.

349
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,818
It's a fun feature, isn't it?
- Absolutely.

350
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,354
Something I never thought
I'd say,

351
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,724
I have a newfound admiration
for potholes.

352
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,560
- So, this is the Dalles.

353
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,130
- Angela: And for the majestic
views found at Interstate Park,

354
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,098
on the Wisconsin side.

355
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,574
Let's skate into our next story

356
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,376
as we visit
a Milwaukee nonprofit

357
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:21,348
keeping a vibrant, deep-rooted
tradition rolling.

358

- Terrence Clarke:
We advertise ourselves

361
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,296
as a fitness class.

362
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,802
But it's really about the
culture, promoting the culture.

363
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:45,172
We exist to promote Black
culture roller skating.

364
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:50,344
We exist to teach it to people
that don't know about it.

365
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,881
So that's how Roll Train
got started.

366
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,185
- Angela: Roll Train
is a roller dance studio

367

by Terrence Clarke

and partner Ellen Fine.

teach you how to do it,

370
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,563
how to balance yourself, how to
fall, you know, how to get up.

371
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,332

skating's been an interest

372
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,934
since childhood.

373
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,803
- Terrence: Johnson's Skate
Palace was on 76th Street.

374
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,307
A lot of times, we didn't have
a ride to the skate rink,

375
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,543
so we would skate all the way
to the rink

376
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,246
and then we'd have to skate
all the way home.

379
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,287
the Black culture
skate tradition

380
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:36,590
goes back much longer
as a pastime.

381
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,792
And passion.

382
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:39,993
- Terrence: Skaters have been
skating

383
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,663
since way before the
civil rights movement.

384
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,464
- Angela: During the
civil rights movement,

385
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,835
roller rinks were one more
white-dominated space

386
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,837
to fight to integrate.

387
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,507
But the joy that Black skaters
found couldn't be stopped.

388
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,642
- Terrence: And it's always been
like a stress relief,

389
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,544
a way to express themselves,

390
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,780
a way to connect
with community.

391
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:03,050
- Angela: And it's been a way
to express a unique style.

392
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,787
- Terrence: It's a style that
nobody else gave us.

393
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,455
It's a style we created.

394
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,490
This is really like an art form.

395

? Whoa, I feel good ?
[funky music]

- Angela: At the heart
of Terrence's skating

397
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,265
is what's called JB style,

398
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:22,135
named for the dance moves
of musician James Brown.

399
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,571

of footwork, a lot of stunts.

are going to these parties.

You go to these parties,
it's nothing but love.

has once again been a challenge.

414
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,542
At Red Arrow Park, Roll Train
led the charge

415
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,912
to open up the ice rink
to off-season skating.

416

just to open the gates
so we can skate there.

And they kept giving us many,
many excuses.

Roll Train succeeded

That was a long fight.

for Roll Train

426
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:35,342
to preserve and promote
Black culture roller skating.

at Roll Train are not Black,

467
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:07,461
Let's find that
winner of a drawer.

468
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:08,996
Hey, what are they doing here?

469
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,697
Excuse me.

470
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:14,234
When I was five years old,
I found a dead butterfly

471
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:17,638
on my parents' driveway,
and I was thrilled

472
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:22,743
because to a child, to well,
to anybody with open eyes

473
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,047
and an open mind,
the beauty was exhilarating.

474
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:31,919
I could hold that accessible,
exquisite organism,

475
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,156
and I felt really privileged.

476
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:41,061
And I knew at that point,
I had this nebulous epiphany

477
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:45,465
that insects would be
at the core of my existence.

478
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:48,869
So, when I was asked
to write a book,

479
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:51,405
I titled it
<i>The Insect Epiphany</i>

480
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:55,442
because every day,
there's a new epiphany

481
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:59,079
as to how insects
influence our lives.

482
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:02,783
Cultural entomology,

483
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,354
or how insects have affected
human culture across the world

484
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,890
and throughout history.

485
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,625
[groovy music]

486
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:16,230
On this table, you see insects
in comic books,

487
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:19,867
and then stamps
from across the world.

488
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,703
Products like cochineal.

489
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:27,107
The dried bodies can form this
lustrous red.

490
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,977
Entomophagy, the eating
of insects.

491
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:34,248
High in calories, as well as
micronutrients and protein.

492
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:39,086
Pupae, crickets, grasshoppers,
mealworms, larvae.

493
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:43,190
From Korea, we've got
silkworm moth pupae.

494
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,392
Not my highest recommendation.

495
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,227
Insects as costumes.

496
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:50,330
Here's my sketchbook
designing that number.

497
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:55,469
So when Halloween comes up,
I must have an insect helmet.

498
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:59,239
A bald-faced hornet nest
with entrance as the mouth,

499
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:03,110
and a gaping hole
revealing a brood cone.

500
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:09,283
Paper wasp helmet,
silk tunic and wings,

501
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,887
cochineal sleeves,
paper chest shield.

502
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,156
- Producer: Why, why,
why do you do it?

503
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:18,125
[Barrett laughing]

504
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,764
My reason for involving insects,

505
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:28,569
it affords me
a greater intimacy

506
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,772
with the arthropods
I love.

507
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:35,075
But also, I find art
is an easy, fun,

508
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:40,180
often inspiring way
to communicate

509
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,484
to fellow humans
the value of insects.

510
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:51,391
To explore this
intimate connection

511
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:54,294
we have with insects,

512
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:57,831
that's what's really
exciting to me.

513
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:59,867
