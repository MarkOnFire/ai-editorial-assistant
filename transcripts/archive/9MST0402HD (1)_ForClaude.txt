1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,936
- John McGivern: I'm in the
capital of Indiana.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,771
A city with a very
famous speedway

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,175
and a knack
for reinventing itself.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,177
- Announcer: We thank the
underwriters

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,512
of <i>John McGivern's Main Streets</i>

6
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,781
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,950
[upbeat music]
- There's always something

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,953
shining bright
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,556
- My father taught me that
to make great bakery,

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,224
you have to do it the right way.

11
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:28,829
O&H Danish Bakery, where
kringle traditions begin.

12
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,597
[gentle music]
- Yes,

13
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:34,334
Greendale is beautiful
on the outside.

14
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,571
But it's what's inside
that counts.

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,708
Who doesn't love opening a door
to beautiful treasures?

16
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,444
Whether you're a collector,

17
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,148
in need of the perfect gift,

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,387
or would like something special
for yourself.

19
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,088
Come on in!

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,958
You just gotta see Greendale.

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,927
- Visit Oconomowoc.

22
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,529
Lakes, festivals,
shopping, dining.

23
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,231
The heart of lake country.

24
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:08,602
- Your community's best
selfie spot is Your-Type!

25
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,038
- The Wisconsin Northwoods
are calling.

26
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,773
One word, one place.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,508
Minocqua.

28
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,577
- Announcer: <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i>

29
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,048
is grateful for additional
financial support from

30
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,351
Horicon Bank:
The Natural Choice,

31

West Bend Insurance Company:
The Silver Lining,

32
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,925
our nonprofit,
the Friends of Main Streets,

33
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:35,562
and from the Friends of PBS
Wisconsin.

34
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,365
Thanks, underwriters.

35
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,902
? 'Cause these are
our Main Streets ?

36
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,938
? Something 'bout a hometown
speaks to me ?

37
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,875
? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

38
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,279
? The heart and soul
of community's right here ?

39
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,148
? On these Main Streets ?

40
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,521
- Indianapolis is the
capital of Indiana

41
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,022
and its largest city.

42
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,124
In fact, Indianapolis is
one of the largest cities

43
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:09,363
in the entire Midwest, with a
population of 887,000 people.

44
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,466
Indianapolis is smack dab
in the middle of the state,

45
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,068
where three freeways meet.

46
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,337
In this episode,
we are going to focus

47
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,274
on the east side,
Massachusetts Avenue.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,843
Or as locals call it, Mass Ave.

49
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,715
- Emmy Fink: We have a fun twist
on the history of Indianapolis

50
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:29,983
with its many nicknames.

51
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,818
But we need some props.
- Yes.

52
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,720
- Did you bring my postcards?
- I did.

53
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:34,888
Here we go!

54
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,657
Indy.
- All right, perfect.

55
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,492
Short for Indianapolis.

56
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,229
Which is named after the state,
which is named after the Indians

57
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,998
because Native Americans
have lived here for centuries.

58
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,200
- That's the first.
- Yup.

59
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,601
Oh, next one.

60
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,804
- Indianapolis, the Circle City.
- Yes!

61
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,807
So back in 1821,
they designed it

62
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,510
with a circle
in the center, right.

63
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,912
- John: Monument Circle, right?
- Emmy: You've got it, yes.

64
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,314
- Hold please.

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,149
The racing capital of the world,

66
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,585
because it's home to the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

67
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,321
- Yes, and of course,
we all know the Indy 500,

68
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,490
but they also have a
NASCAR race, the Brick 400.

69
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,692
- Is that right?
- Yes.

70
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,560
- Hold on, I love this one.

71
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,863
Crossroads of America.

72
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,932
- I mean, Indiana is so
centrally located, right?

73
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,268
So it makes sense
that it really became

74
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,770
a transportation hub
once the railroads came.

75
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,072
Business was booming,

76
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,541
but like a lot of cities
in the Rust Belt,

77
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,244
decades later, guess what,
it was hard times.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,079
Plants were closing,
jobs were lost,

79
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,647
big employers left town.

80
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,650
But this is how they
earned their next nickname.

81
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,585
Diamond in the Rust.

82
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,753
- Diamond in the Rust!

83
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,921
It makes sense.

84
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,122
- Isn't that cute?
- Yeah.

85
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,124
- Because they always
found a way to bounce back.

86
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,326
- John: What we're gonna focus
on is the northeast area,

87
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,694
Massachusetts Avenue,

88
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,564
which used to be a really
big manufacturing center.

89
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,600
Now it's become great
and fun and cool.

90
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,602
Do you wanna go?
- Great, fun, and cool, yes!

91
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,337
- Come on!
- Yes!

92
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,941
- Do you ever meet anyone
and think,

93
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,043
"He's got the best job
in the whole world."

94
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,711
And what do you do for a living?

95
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,313
- Sampson Levingston: I lead
walk and talks.

96
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,481
So walking history tours

97
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,650
all over the great city
of Indianapolis.

98
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,652
And it's my favorite thing
to do in the world.

99
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,253
- John: And this is
your full-time job?

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,655
- Sampson: Yeah,
that's what I do.

101
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,056
I do, like, 10, 12
different neighborhoods

102
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,224
here in Indianapolis.

103
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,892
You know, all over the city.

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,494
- Where are we
right this minute?

105
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,462
- Right now,
we're on Massachusetts Ave.

106
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,532
So this is all interconnected
by our Cultural Trail.

107
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,502
Indianapolis, about
15 years ago, decided

108
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,838
let's try to prioritize
the pedestrian

109
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,873
and reconnect
downtown Indianapolis.

110
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,775
And the Cultural Trail
does just that.

111
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,376
And I think that's
one of the things

112
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,679
that really helped bring
this downtown district back.

113
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,480
- It feels very cool
down here, doesn't it?

114
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,682
- No, it is, it is.

115
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,483
This is where the cool people
are, so welcome.

116
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,085
- Can we talk about her?
- Yeah.

117
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,087
- Who is that?
- We talk about Ann Dancing.

118
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,723
She's been on the Cultural Trail
for almost 20 years now.

119
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,758
Ann Dancing is dancing

120
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,094
at four different paces
all around.

121
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,997
It depends where you catch her,
John, it really does.

122
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,232
- Now you're scaring me.

123
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,933
Most of these are
original buildings?

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,236
- Yes, you can tell
from looking at which ones

125
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,670
are a little bit newer.

126
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,306
But Indianapolis is really proud
of what we've created down here.

127
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,275
Okay, all these
neighborhoods are walkable.

128
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,711
And we're starting to realize
the value in that,

129
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,312
the connectivity in that.

130
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,914
And we're starting
to create more and more

131
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,082
of these walkable neighborhoods.

132
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,884
History connects us
in Indianapolis,

133
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,285
and so I love when I'm learning.

134
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,254
- And it's important
to talk about that history,

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,356
because that history led
to what's today.

136
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,259
What is this?
- The Murat Shriners Temple.

137
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,227
The largest in the country.

138
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,630
This one went up in 1909.

139
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,864
- John: And it's still active?

140
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,366
- Yes, still active,
still shows there

141
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,834
almost every single weekend.

142
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,636
And so it's a big part
of our city.

143
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,803
I never wanna leave.

144
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,005
I never wanna go anywhere else.

145
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,173
I love this place.

146
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,607
I love learning
about this place.

147
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,975
I love learning
about its people.

148
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,844
I think it's the greatest city
in the world.

149
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,046
- And a perfect job for you.
- Yes, it is.

150
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,048
Every day, I get to learn
more about my city

151
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,551
and my community and myself.
- You're terrific.

152
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,718
- Thank you, man.

153
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,887
Thank you, thank you.

154
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,623
- On Mass Avenue, you're bound
to run into famous locals.

155
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,194
And let me tell you something,
they are larger than life.

156

158
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,333
Born and raised in Indy.

an author and a poet

160
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,440
who came to fame
in the 1960s and '70s.

161
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:17,177
And her work emphasized
African-American culture

162
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,146
and social justice.

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,216
And Reggie Miller, who played
for the Indiana Pacers

164
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,417
for 18 years.

165
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,152
He was one of the
greatest shooters

166
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,954
in the history of the NBA.

167
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,589
Yeah, and no wonder.

168
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,424
He's 60 feet tall!

169
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,662
We're at a company
called Volumod.

170
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,164
And it's a great story.

171
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,567
Modular home refers
to exactly what?

172
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,969
- Ryan Scott: Basically
a product

173
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,204
that's built in modules,
sections.

174
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,607
- John: How long does it
take you to build a house?

175
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,676
- Ryan: We're able to produce
a module from framing the floor

176
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,513
to a finished product
in about 13 working days.

177
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,648
- Thirteen working days, that's
kind of remarkable, isn't it?

178
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,250
- It is crazy, isn't it?
- Yeah.

179
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,417
And let's talk mission.

180
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,253
- Jennifer Smith:
Yes, our real mission

181
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,654
is to restore hope.

182
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,090
We want to increase
affordable housing in Indiana,

183
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,392
which is a huge crisis
nationwide.

184
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,394
- So Fred, they wanted me
to talk to you

185
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,530
because they think you know
what you're doing.

186
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,697
Isn't that good?

187
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,899
- Fred Hatton: Well, that's
good.

188
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,066
I'm fair for a square.

189
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,835
[both laughing]
- Good!

190
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,003
What do you do here?

191
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,571
- Fred: I do the electrical.

192
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,406
I do the panels,
I do the switches.

193
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,674
The receptacles.

194
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,277
- Let's also talk
mission of workforce.

195
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,280
- Jennifer: We believe in the
power of transformation.

196
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,950
- Really, our pride and joy
is our second chance program.

197
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,586
That includes people that
have been incarcerated.

198
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,189
That includes people that are
recovering from addiction.

199
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,957
And it also includes veterans.

200
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,793
If you've got a record,
you can't find a place to live,

201
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,495
you can't find a job.

202
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,164
And so a lot of times,
that leads 'em right back

203
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,332
to where they're at.

204
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,800
- They interviewed me
for this job

205
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:47,968
while I was in prison.

206
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,369
- John: While you
were in prison?

207
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,537
- Fred: Yes.

208
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,939
And so actually,
when I came out,

209
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,140
I came home to a job.

210
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,341
- We have wraparound services,

211
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,010
so we offer, like, counseling
and coaching.

212
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,612
And we say, "Well,
what do you need

213
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,880
coming out of incarceration?"

214
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,481
- When you get ready
to find yourself

215
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,083
in a position
to get out of prison,

216
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,251
you've gotta have a plan

217
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,652
and you've gotta
have a support group.

218
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,820
- John: A support.

219
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,021
- A support system.
- Yeah.

220
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,289
- Yeah, you've
gotta have support.

221
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,259
- We're unashamedly a
Christian-based organization.

222
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,729
We feel like its our duty
to give back to the community.

223
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,565
We've got some phenomenal
success stories.

224
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,168
Volumod was really
their last chance.

225
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,970
- Coming from where I come from,
you learn

226
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,606
to have an appreciation
for a company like this

227
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,241
who's willing to take a chance.

228
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,876
And I value that.

229
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,746
I mean, it makes you
just wanna come to work.

230
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,749
- We have found another
nickname for Indianapolis.

231
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,150
Nap Town.

232
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,787
So back in the '20s, this area
was a really big jazz scene.

233
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,958
And Black musicians shortened
Indianapolis to Nap Town.

234
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,461
The locals are reclaiming it,
as you can see here

235
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,662
at Nap or Nothing.

236
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,398
So, grab a T-shirt, grab a hat.

237
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:56,370
Just get back to it, because
there's no time for a nap.

238
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,273
- I'm in the oldest
continuously operating

239
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,275
shoe store in the country.

240
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,910
I think I wanna try these on.

241
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,311
What do you think?

242
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,479
Come on.

243
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,680
I bet we can find help,

244
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,949
because this place is known
for its service.

245
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,919
You've been in this location
for how long, this shoe store?

246
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,121
- Stephanie Stout: Since 1886.
- Say it one more time.

247
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,089
- 1886, it's unbelievable.

248
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,558
We opened in this location.

249
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,927
We've never moved, never closed.

250
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,328
And we are still here.

251
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,663
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

252
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,632
- John: Why is this such a
great place to shop for shoes?

253
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,301
- Stephanie: We kind of cater
to everyone.

254
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,404
Just so many widths
and sizes and styles.

255
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,640
Being measured and fitted
is really important.

256
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,843
- Has the art of measuring
changed?

257
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,010
- No.
- No.

258
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,112
- It's still, it's
the Brannock device.

259
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,981
It hasn't changed.

260
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,617
Okay, if you could put
your right foot on there.

261
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,819
All the way to the back
and stand up for me

262
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:46,987
real straight and tall.

263
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,789
So this is the one
that you were admiring?

264
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,891
- Oh, how'd you know?
- Lucky guess, I guess.

265
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,292
- Are my feet the same size?

266
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,461
- They actually were really
close to each other, yeah.

267
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,563
- They're kind of perfect
with my outfit.

268
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,731
They feel really good, too.

269
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,833
- They look nice, John.
- Thank you.

270
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,035
- This is a 22 wide.
- Oh!

271
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,072
- And this was a prototype
for Shaquille O'Neal

272
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,107
when he was first in the NBA.

273
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,509
- I feel tiny!

274
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,745
Customer-wise, do you
have generations of people

275
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,347
who are like,
this is where I shop?

276
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,515
- Absolutely.

277
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,116
A lot of people still
remember the baskets.

278
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,518
- John: The baskets?
- Stephanie: Yes.

279
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,853
- And how's it work?
- I've made the sale.

280
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,022
So you've given me your cash.
- Okay.

281
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,258
- I've given you a token
that matches this.

282
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,393
We're putting the cash in here.

283
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,028
- John: This is
the actual cash box.

284
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,229
- This is the cash box.

285
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,231
Now we are sending it up
to the office staff

286
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,368
so they can check it and
wrap it and make your change.

287
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,969
- John: And when
were they put in?

288
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,137
- Stephanie: 1920s.

289
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,872
A lot of people still enjoy it.

290
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,708
- I've never been in a place
that had a shop bird.

291
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,076
[bird squawking]

292
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,613
- In the basement, we have
all the handwritten receipts.

293
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,348
$68 in a size 12 B.

294
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,818
- Aisle after aisle.
- Yes.

295
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,322
Just full of thousands
of pairs of shoes.

296
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,124
- What are your hopes
for the future?

297
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,959
- It's definitely
a legacy business,

298
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,562
and we just hope to keep
it going as long as we can.

299
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,364
With your best shoe,
you are your best you.

300
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,099
[laughing]

301
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:12,706
- From 1974 to 1999,
the Marketplace Arena

302
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:16,443
stood downtown
and it looked like this.

303
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,680
One of the world's
greatest performers

304
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,950
gave his last performance
right here.

305
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,187
Who was he?
[playful music]

306
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,790
- No one knew it at the time,

307
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:34,595
but Indy was the last chance
to see the King, Elvis Presley.

308
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,065
He performed here
on June 26, 1977,

309
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,367
but died
less than two months later.

310
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,036
So right behind me was where
the Market Square Arena

311
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,204
used to be.

312
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,539
It is now a Whole Foods.

313
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,441
So I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get

314
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,909
a peanut butter
and banana sandwich,

315
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,245
which was Elvis' favorite.

316
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,313
- Okay, what is this missing?

317
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,048
No, not me.

318
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,818
I.

319
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,053
Get it?

320
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,757
We're in the lobby
of this beautiful hotel

321
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,425
called Bottleworks Hotel.

322
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,593
- Josh Rodgers: We're definitely

323
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,396
in a 1931 Coca-Cola
bottling plant.

324
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,265
It's written on the exterior
of the building.

325
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,467
- John: And it was the
largest one in the U.S.

326
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:14,635
in the late 1940s?

327
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,371
- Yeah, in the late 1940s,
early '50s.

328
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,373
And at one point,
they were bottling, I believe,

329
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,175
somewhere upwards
of two million bottles.

330
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,776
- John: And how
long was Coke here?

331
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,178
- Josh: Up through the
early '60s.

332
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,345
They then sold it

333
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,680
and Indianapolis
Public School System

334
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,184
owned this property
up until 2017.

335
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,186
- John: The vision
to turn into what it is.

336
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,188
- Josh: Yeah, in any of
these sorts of situations,

337
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,489
there's two roads, right?

338
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,392
Like you either tear it down,
or you honor what's here.

339
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,461
And they've done a great job,
I think, of kind of doing both.

340
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,630
They're craftsmen,
the folks who helped

341
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:44,798
bring this back to life.

342
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,600
- John: How long have you
been doing this?

343
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,001
- Josh: I've been here
at Bottleworks

344
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,169
since we opened in 2020.

345
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,671
And I've been the
general manager now

346
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,072
for a little over two years.

347
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,507
- Good job.
- Thank you.

348
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,809
- This is gorgeous, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's stunning.

349
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,312
Again, it's all been here
since 1931.

350
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,913
- John: How many
rooms do you have?

351
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,215
- Josh: We have 139 rooms.

352
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,384
And 84 of those are on the
original second floor.

353
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,787
And then we have another 55
on the third floor.

354
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:07,955
- John: The doors?

355
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,157
- This is where we give
a little bit of respect

356
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,558
to the Coca-Cola name on these,
yeah.

357
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,427
This is automobile paint.

358
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,730
If we ever fix or work on these,
we send 'em to a body shop.

359
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,031
- Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,901
All of our rooms are decorated
in a similar fashion.

361
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,504
The focus is just being
comfortable and welcoming

362
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,671
and warm, you know.

363
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,007
- John: What a great complex
this is.

364
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,643
- Josh: This Coca-Cola bottling
plant district is 12 acres.

365
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,145
- John: And what is happening
in what you call The Garage?

366
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,516
- Josh: So that was truly the
garage for all of the trucks.

367
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,184
- John: Mm-hmm.
- Josh: And then recently,

368
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,286
it's become something
quite different.

369
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,722
There's over 21 different food
and drink vendors in there

370
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,458
and tangent
with the hotel itself,

371
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,059
I mean, it makes
the district a space

372
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,795
that you don't need to leave.

373
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:54,768
- There are large employers,
and there are <i>large</i> employers.

374
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,503
This is Lilly.

375
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,438
We all know Lilly.

376
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,709
It started here in 1876
with three employees.

377
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:08,115
Today, it employs over 12,000
people in Indianapolis.

378
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,883
Lilly is well-known
in this community

379
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,652
for supporting the community.

380
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,721
So if you're exploring
Indianapolis,

381
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:15,989
take a look around.

382
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:20,727
You will see signs that say,
"Supported by Lilly."

383
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,964
What is this restaurant,
what do you serve?

384
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,667
- Taelor Carmine: So we are a
Thai craft cocktail bar

385
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,235
and traditional Thai food.

386
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,469
- What does that include?

387
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,572
- So traditional Thai food
is something

388
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,575
that we all grew up
enjoy eating together

389
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,043
and cooking together.

390
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:40,347
It's authentic and traditional,
and it's enjoyable by my family

391
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,050
and hopefully the
Indy community.

392
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,218
- John: Right.

393
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,819
- Taelor: But it's
always been my dream

394
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,821
and my family's dreams
to have a place like this.

395
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,022
- John: Is there
family involved?

396
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,724
- Taelor: My mom
and my grandmother.

397
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,726
My mom cooks in the kitchen
every day.

398
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,595
She cook a lot
of the same thing

399
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,863
that my grandmother cooked.

400
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,867
So our menu pretty much
focus on traditional.

401
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,635
- Your grandma's stuff.
- Recipe.

402
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,604
- Your room is beautiful.
- Thank you.

403
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,105
- This is a
beautiful restaurant.

404
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,907
- Taelor: We have a
really nice indoor dining

405
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,877
and also a very nice
outdoor dining as well.

406
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,812
- How did you make your way
to Indianapolis?

407
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,046
How did this become home?

408
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,249
- I was here since 1999.

409
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,484
Moved to the U.S. with my mom,

410
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,653
and then I've been here
ever since.

411
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,922
- Yeah, you were a baby.
- This is my home.

412
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,190
This is my home now.

413
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,992
- You have craft cocktails?
- Dalton Lineback: Yes.

414
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,994
- John: So when somebody
calls it a craft drink,

415
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,595
how is that different
than any other drink?

416
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,231
- I would say craft is just
much more intentional.

417
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:34,768
We are not just throwing
ingredients in a tin.

418
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:37,237
You know, there's lots
of research and development.

419
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,540
It's gonna get some
pineapple juice.

420
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,376
Some jasmine honey
coconut cream.

421
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,144
It's important that
people are coming here

422
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,345
and being able to get something

423
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,049
that they're gonna enjoy,
that's gonna be fun.

424
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,685
[shakers rattling]
[John laughing]

425
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,520
- Look at that!

426
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:54,788
Yum!

427
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,957
So you make bartending
seem like an art.

428
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,692
- It is.
- It is.

429
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,394
- Hi.

430
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,962
The drunken noodles.

431
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,565
And this dish is usually
served pretty spicy.

432
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,733
- I like spicy.
- Taelor: Well...

433
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,268
- Not crazy spicy, though.

434
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,871
This is getting interesting.
[laughing]

435
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,073
This, just so you know,
is my favorite part.

436
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,475
- And this is our pad thai.

437
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,478
Probably the most popular dish
from Thailand

438
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,147
here in the States.
- Yeah.

439
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,482
- And you know,
in Thailand, we definitely

440
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,284
like to do communal style.

441
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,354
That's how we do it in Thailand
is just, share everything.

442
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,156
- Terrific pad thai.

443
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,158
Thank you so much
for opening your doors to us.

444
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,960
- Taelor: Thank you so much
for coming, John.

445
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,128
- John: Congratulations.

446
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,631
- The east side of Indy has
these cozy little neighborhoods

447
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,433
and then all of a sudden,
you come across

448
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,767
this grand brick building

449
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,103
and you're thinking,
"Wow, what is that?"

450
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,172
When it was built back in 1864,

451
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:48,075
it was one of only
three federal arsenals

452
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,711
where they housed weapons
from the Civil War

453
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,546
and the Spanish-American War.

454
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:54,781
Well, ever since 1912,
guess what?

455
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,317
It has been a high school,
Arsenal Tech.

456
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,554
And it sits right here
on 76 acres of land.

457
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,156
I think it looks more like a
college, wouldn't you say?

458
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,324
It's just awesome.

459
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,726
Think about it,
there has been more

460
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,362
than 100 graduating classes
through those doors.

461
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:13,100
I mean, I'd say they put
the old arsenal to good use.

462
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,470
- What's Indy Fused Glass?

463
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,071
- Lisa Pelo: Indy Fused Glass
has been

464
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,640
in the building
about seven years.

465
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,241
We think it's a great complement

466
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,944
to our nonprofit
Glass Arts Indiana studio.

467
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:27,948
We're promoting all versions
of creating with glass.

468
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,551
So Indy Fused is all
about learning how

469
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,153
to fuse glass into composition.

470
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,223
The gallery is where
our artist members

471
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,391
can sell their work.

472
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,692
- And the other studio?

473
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,061
- Glass Arts Indiana,
we're a nonprofit

474
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,063
and we teach furnace working.

475
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,965
So it's got a big tub
of hot glass

476
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:47,000
running at 2,100 degrees

477
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,303
and we teach you how to create
with molten glass.

478
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,470
- How great is that?

479
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:51,638
What am I making?

480
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,240
- Justin Kern: A flower.
- A flower?

481
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,609
- Yep, so the three big rules
are always level.

482
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:56,877
Always turning.

483
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:59,479
And then keeping our hands
in the shiny area.

484
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,647
This is the furnace.

485
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,049
This is where all the glass is.

486
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,551
It's currently set
to 2,100 degrees.

487
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,820
- Geez!
[Justin laughing]

488
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,822
- So always set your pipe
on that back corner,

489
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,458
and eventually, you'll see the
glass winding up on the pipe.

490
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,626
- Okay.

491
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,162
- So we'll come back here,
we'll cool the rod.

492
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,631
And then I'm gonna
move over to this table.

493
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,499
So that's step one.

494
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,603
So we'll come over here
in the reheating chamber

495
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,638
so that we can
put on the stem color.

496
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,240
We'll just kinda
lay the glass in there

497
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,442
and give it a good roll.

498
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,511
We'll melt all that back in.

499
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,912
Then we'll come back over here

500
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,348
and we're just gonna go
nice and level on the table.

501
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,049
All right, that's
probably good and cooled.

502
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,818
So we'll head back over
to the furnace.

503
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,320
- I need another glob of glass.
- Yep, exactly.

504
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,122
So we're just gonna coat
the whole thing again.

505
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,290
- Yikes!

506
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,526
- Nice and level,
keep it turning.

507
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,728
And then you go
straight up and down.

508
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,730
And then letting it land
on the red mix.

509
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,365
- John: Oh, that's what we do.

510
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,966
- And then we'll
go cool the rod.

511
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,134
- Okay.

512
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,435
Turning?
- Justin: Always.

513
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,305
- John: Okay, don't yell at me.
[Justin chuckling]

514
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,641
- We're gonna start
heating in the petal color.

515
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:01,808
- Okay.

516
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,211
- And then I'll have you
take a seat at the bench.

517
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:05,412
You'll be sitting
with the tweezers.

518
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,214
- I can do nothing
with my right hand.

519
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,382
Nothing!

520
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,284
Are there no
lefthanded glass works?

521
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,519
- No, well, we--
- She said no!

522
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,122
- We force you
to be right-handed.

523
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,990
- Oh, I'd be so good
with this hand.

524
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,158
[Lisa laughing]

525
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,394
- All right, hot glass,
here you go.

526
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,263
- So, we're gonna start off
just by doing little pinches.

527
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,066
- Oh, I'm weak
in this hand, too!

528
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,302
Oh, Lord!
- All right.

529
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,537
And then once we pinch all
the way around the edge,

530
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,140
then we'll start pulling and
stretching out that flower.

531
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,308
Nice and even.

532
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,809
All the way around.

533
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,811
Now we're gonna start
kind of pulling away from us.

534
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:38,979
Kind of flaring.

535
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,850
And at the very end,
we'll do a big pull.

536
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,785
And then I'll have you
head back here.

537
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,087
And then give it a light
little tap right there.

538
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:49,089
There you go.
- John: Nice!

539
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,958
- Justin: And that's it,
easy peasy.

540
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,559
- John: Good job,
that was really good.

541
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,361
You're a great teacher, too.
- Justin: Thank you.

542
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,562
- Lisa: What's
nice about glass,

543
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,331
you never learn everything.

544
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:01,001
There's always something new
to work in with your glass.

545
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,171
- John McGivern, glass artist.

546
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,107
I made this.

547
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,878
I haven't made a dent here
at the CCIC.

548
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,413
There are over 150 tenants.

549
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,583
One of the most famous artists
here from Indianapolis

550
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,585
is Martha Nahrwold.

551
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,522
She takes ink
and she drips it in water,

552
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,358
and then she transfers
that ink to paper,

553
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,793
and she has her own style
of impressionism.

554
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,695
It's really beautiful.

555
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,365
There is a high-end
furniture store

556
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,966
where they make the furniture.

557
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,969
And there's painters
and there's jewelers.

558
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,704
And you've gotta visit
the second floor.

559
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,139
That's where they have a gallery

560
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:42,142
that changes the exhibits
all the time.

561
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,144
And a lot of businesses
have their offices here,

562
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:45,846
like the 500 Festival.

563
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:50,450
They organize the community
to celebrate the Indy 500.

564
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:54,354
So, there's only
140 businesses to go.

565
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,959
Indiana honors veterans
at Monument Circle

566
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:03,864
as well as right here at the
Indiana World War Memorial.

567
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,966
As well as other places
around town.

568
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:09,336
In fact, Washington, D.C.
is the only city

569
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:12,272
that has more memorials
to veterans.

570
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,174
Indianapolis
and Washington, D.C.

571
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:17,578
also have something else
in common.

572
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,248
What is that?
[playful music]

573
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,185
- Engineer Alexander Ralston
designed the layouts

574
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:27,087
for both Indy and D.C.

575
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,857
And the similarities
are right here on the streets.

576
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:33,727
So Indy has angled main avenues
just like D.C.,

577
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,362
and then in both places,
they named

578
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,264
a lot of their streets
after states.

579
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:40,000
So Delaware, Ohio, New York.

580
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:42,369
I haven't seen a Wisconsin yet,

581
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:46,240
but of course,
they have Massachusetts.

582
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,744
You know, there is so much
that's new on Mass Ave,

583
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,347
which is why it makes
buildings like this so special.

584
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,948
This is the Athenaeum.

585
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,384
- Talk about historic,
this place is gorgeous.

586
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:58,552
- Absolutely stunning.

587
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,921
It was established
by the Turners in 1894.

588
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,024
Not like a Mr. and Mrs. Turner,
the Turners.

589
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,492
- We know the Turners
because there's

590
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,929
Turner Hall in our hometown
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

591
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,665
It was a movement started
by German immigrants.

592
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,700
- Emmy: They were all about
promoting balance.

593
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,970
Their mantra was,
"a sound mind in a sound body."

594
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:18,138
Which, I love that.

595
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,806
And they were actually gymnasts.

596
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:21,008
That's how they got their name.

597
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,176
They were flipping and turning.

598
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:23,443
- Sound mind, sound body.

599
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,879
Sound body sounds like exercise
to me.

600
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,047
- Yes, yes.

601
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,649
- So, why don't
you take that part.

602
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,651
I'm gonna take the sound mind,
because you know me.

603
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,853
- You are of sound mind.

604
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:37,090
Now this side of the building
was all about physical fitness,

605
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,194
and the Turners stayed fit
with things like pommel horse,

606
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,262
bowling, gymnastics,
and fencing.

607
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,064
And these were their weights.

608
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,266
Let me tell ya, I don't know
how they stayed fit

609
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,535
because there's nothing
to these guys.

610
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,705
- It's important to exercise
the mind as well.

611
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:54,341
So this place was all
about free thinking.

612
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:58,111
There were lectures and debates
and presentations.

613
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:00,347
Today, local groups
use this for shows

614
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,449
and they use it
for art exhibits.

615
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:03,650
Talk about a beer garden.

616
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:04,818
How great is this place?

617
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,153
- I love this place!

618
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,355
- And you know, this place
is usually just packed out.

619
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:09,523
- Why is it not?

620
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,425
- Because it's 9:00 A.M.,
that's why.

621
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,560
- Maybe just a touch
too early to drink.

622
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,761
So we're in the basement.

623
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:15,996
This is the Rathskeller.

624
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:19,066
It is the oldest continually
operated restaurant

625
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,801
