00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,937
- I'm in Helenville
at Jelli's Market,

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,439
learning about one
of Wisconsin's

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:10,210
favorite summertime activities:
berry picking.

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,945
[lively music]

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,715
I sat down with Libby,

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,117
whose parents bought this farm
in the '80s

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:21,288
but didn't start
strawberry farming 'til 2001.

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,823
- Libby Hafften: They've got
a little bit

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,991
of farming background,

10
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,893
but kind of jumped
into strawberries headfirst.

11
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,229
Didn't really know anything
they were doing,

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,765
but it's kind of exploded
since then, obviously.

13
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:37,504
And now we have blueberries and
raspberries, apples, pumpkins.

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,373
One thing for sure
that makes us unique

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,675
is we don't have
an admission fee.

16
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,745
That is one thing that my
parents really were against

17
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,913
when they decided

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,915
that they wanted to be more
of a u-pick farm

19
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,784
and let people come
and get their own produce.

20
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,887
It's just nice that
we allow people to come

21
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,689
and just hang out
if they want to

22
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,959
and be in agriculture
and be away from the city

23
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,029
and learn something new
while they're here.

24
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,197
- Customer: Thank you.

25
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,398
- That's truly creating a space

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,433
for the community.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,269
People can come in the
farm store and buy meat

28
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:13,407
like pork and beef and lamb,
chicken, turkeys.

29
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,510
And then any
of our other products.

30
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,712
- Angela: There's an array
of different food items

31
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,315
that people can enjoy fresh
throughout the year.

32
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,584
- Libby: Absolutely.
- Well, welcome.

33
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,052
Thanks for coming.

34
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,020
- So you and your sister still
run the farm?

35
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,355
- Yes.

36
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,725
My sister Lindsay and I
co-manage Jelli's together now.

37
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,828
She does a lot of the berries
and the vegetables.

38
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,197
I'm mainly in charge
of our orchard.

39
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,000
So I get to work with not only
my sister, but my best friend.

40
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,402
And, you know,
we get sick of each other

41
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,305
and bicker like sisters do,
but at the end of the day,

42
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,107
we both want our business
to succeed

43
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,876
and we want to make
our family better,

44
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,845
so we have the same goal
in mind.

45
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,614
- Angela: I love that.

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,349
And you're able to continue
your family's legacy together.

47
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,650
- Libby: Yes, exactly.

48
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,452
- So, Libby, I do want to go out

49
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,653
and pick some blueberries
with you.

50
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,054
- Okay.
- Before we do that,

51
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,656
is there anything I should keep
in mind?

52
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,824
Anything unique
about blueberry picking

53
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,058
for a first-time
blueberry picker?

54
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,528
- [laughs] Well, what color
are blueberries?

55
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,563
- They're blue.
- They are blue, that's good.

56
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,398
So we should probably make sure

57
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,100
we don't pick any green ones,
right?

58
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,135
- Okay, I'm assuming that means
they're not ready, or?

59
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,737
- That would be correct.
- Okay, okay.

60
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,906
That's good to know.
- That's the biggest tip.

61
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,908
- Make sure they're blue
at the time of picking.

62
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,075
- Yes.

63
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,577
And other than that,
it's pretty easy.

64
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,745
- Okay, awesome.

65
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,346
Well, can you go show me?
- Absolutely!

66
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,081
- Thank you.

67
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,053
With my first blueberry
picking lesson under my belt,

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,255
we headed out to the field.

69
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,757
With a little help.

70
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,060
So which ones feel ripe
for picking over here?

71
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,462
- Well, we want the blue ones.

72
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,098
- Angela: And a taste or two.

73
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,135
- You wanna try one?
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,503
These are good.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,705
And we allow people to, y'know,
eat while they pick.

76
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,106
That's part of the fun.
- Aww.

77
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,412
- Part of the experience.
- I'm sure that's appreciated.

78
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:02,049
Whether in the field
or in the shop,

79
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:07,988
Jelli's Market offers a tasty
way to enjoy a Wisconsin summer.

80
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,723
