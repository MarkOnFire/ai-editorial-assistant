00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,938
- My name is
Vivian Van de Sype Cucu,

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,342
and I am a senior at the
University School of Milwaukee.

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,844
My family and I,
we're really close.

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,380
We really like sailing together.

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,216
I've been sailing
for as long as I can remember.

7
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,720
With sailing, you have to adapt
to the wind and who you're with.

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,155
And with music,
I kind of have to adapt

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:28,128
with the people I'm playing with
or the hall that I'm playing in.

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,232
I think the viola is a pretty
interesting instrument.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,669
It has such a beautiful tone,
almost like a singing voice.

12
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,404
[viola music]

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,576
I started playing
when I was four years old.

14
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,614
I really enjoy playing
in ensembles.

15
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,417
The viola adds
a really unique texture,

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,953
and I love to provide that.

17
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,958
I'm a part of the Music
Institute of Chicago Academy,

18
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,362
and my quartet is definitely
my favorite part.

19
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,201
My nonprofit organization,
Musicians for Hope,

20
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,870
is a collaboration between me
and a few peers

21
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,371
from the Academy.

22
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,575
We try to raise money
to bring instruments

23
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:19,546
and better funded music programs
to public schools.

24
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,815
- Davis King: Ha!

25
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,283
That's better.

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,052
- Vivian: I've been studying
with Davis King

27
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,020
for three years now.

28
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,523
He's helped me progress
exponentially.

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,960
He's really enjoyable
to work with, and I love him.

30
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,028
- No change of bow speed.
- Really?

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,631
He really makes me
have to perfect it

32
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,233
before we can move on.

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,667
That's really helpful.

34
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,835
- Now you're getting sharp.

35
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,437
- I will be playing
the first movement

36
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,539
of the Walton Viola Concerto.

37
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,074
The beginning's really soft,

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,811
but it gets really intense
as it goes on.

39
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,549
I know Walton was in love
with someone,

40
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,618
but it was sort of
an unrequited love.

41
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,955
I try to think of that when
I play, but I can't relate.

42
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,057
The ending is so wonderful.

43
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:09,129
It just slowly fades away
and it sort of dies at the end.

44
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,868
Playing with the
Madison Symphony Orchestra

45
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,870
is definitely a big deal.

46
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,072
I'm just gonna really try
to savor the moment

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,608
and appreciate the music.

48
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,214
