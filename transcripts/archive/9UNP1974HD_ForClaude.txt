- Jenny Pederson:
Welcome to today's

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,139
"History Sandwiched In" program.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,374
My name is Jenny Pederson,

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,842
and I am the
public programs manager

6
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,378
with the Wisconsin
Historical Society.

7
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,081
A quick note
that opinions expressed today

8
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,349
are those of the presenter,

9
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,518
and not necessarily those
of the historical society

10
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,253
or its employees.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,221
Also, thank you to

12
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:26,860
the Wisconsin Historical Society
Press, who is here today,

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,796
and for the support
in identifying

14
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:34,334
and sharing authors for
this program, including Jesus.

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,470
Thank you also to PBS Wisconsin,

16
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,739
who is here today
with Jesus's permission

17
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,109
to record and stream his lecture
to include it as part

18
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,611
of the <i>University Place</i>
programming,

19
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:48,916
available on PBS Wisconsin
channels as well as online.

20
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,651
A few notes for

21
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,121
if you are gonna be looking
for this program in the future.

22
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,590
Please note that you
will find the program titled

23
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,893
"Obreros Unidos:
Roots and Legacy."

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,297
That is the title that
you would put in the search bar.

25
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,300
So now to the reason
that you are all here today.

26
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,303
Today it is an absolute pleasure
to welcome author,

27
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,172
historian, and activist
Jesus Salas,

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,340
who is presenting

29
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,442
"Obreros Unidos"--
"United Workers"--

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,610
"The Roots and Legacy

31
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,213
of Wisconsin's
Farmworkers Movement."

32
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,282
Jesus's presentation today
is based on his book

33
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,518
<i>Obreros Unidos:</i>
<i>The Roots and Legacy</i>

34
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,821
<i>of the Farmworkers Movement,</i>
pictured here,

35
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,692
a recipient of not just one
but two publishing honors:

36
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,430
the 2024 Benjamin Franklin Award
for Multicultural Books

37
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:41,134
and the 2024 Hamlin Garland
Prize in Popular History.

38
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,605
I also want to take a moment
to spotlight a documentary

39
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,408
based on Jesus's memoir
titled <i>Roots and Legacy.</i>

40
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,211
This documentary is associated
with ?Adelante!

41
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,281
and presented by Milwaukee PBS.

42
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,785
It is premiering and available
for viewing this month.

43
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,721
To learn more
about that program

44
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,524
and to learn some more history
about this, excuse me,

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,126
to learn some more history
about this topic,

46
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,863
please do check out
milwaukeepbs.org.

47
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,034
And now I am finally
getting to your bio.

48
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,837
There's so many good things
to share.

49
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,606
Jesus Salas founded
Obreros Unidos

50
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,875
and was the first Latino CEO

51
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,279
for United Migrant
Opportunity Services.

52
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,715
He taught bilingual courses at
Milwaukee Area Technical College

53
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:33,554
for two decades, was a lecturer
at UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee,

54
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,690
and later served
as UW System regent.

55
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,793
Salas lives in Milwaukee,
where he continues to be active

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,130
in Latino community
organizations.

57
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,799
Salas is a third-generation
migrant worker

58
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,769
and was part of a stream
of individuals and families

59
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,705
that seasonally journeyed
from the Texas borderlands

60
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,242
to the Great Lakes to harvest
a wide variety of crops

61
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,679
that fueled the agricultural
economies of this region.

62
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,147
In riveting detail,

63
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,951
he describes the brutal working
and poor living conditions

64
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,053
in these migrant camps.

65
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,922
Taking inspiration
from Cesar Chavez,

66
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,259
Salas organized
the first sustained effort

67
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,996
to organize migrant
seasonal workers in the Midwest.

68
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,066
This transnational movement
went beyond the fields

69
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,135
to have a lasting impact
on building sustainable,

70
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,939
urban, community-based
organizations in Wisconsin,

71
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,041
providing needed
social services

72
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,544
and empowering Chicanos
and Latinos

73
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,313
to access and take
advantage of programming

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,483
at post-secondary institutions
in Wisconsin,

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,920
including UW-Milwaukee
and UW-Madison.

76
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,922
Please join me
in welcoming Jesus,

77
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,658
and enjoy the presentation.

78
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,128
[audience applauding]

79
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,133
- Jesus Salas: Thank you,
thank you very much.

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,801
Thank you, Jenny.

81
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,771
And we'll start with some maps.

82
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,942
Here we have two maps.

83
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,644
The one on the upper right

84
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,614
is a map of the Texas frontier
in the 1840s.

85
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,751
And the reason I include this
is because I'm showing

86
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,520
the first generation
of migrant workers there.

87
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,190
That is,
my grandfather's migrating

88
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,760
from the state of Coahuila
to the state of Texas.

89
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,261
At one time, by the way,

90
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:26,333
these two areas were one state
of the states in Mexico.

91
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,004
You can see
how they were joined.

92
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,973
My grandfather was,

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,043
made his way
through that community

94
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,312
up in the northern part
of the lower map.

95
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,748
That is the state of Coahuila,
Piedras Negras--

96
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,318
or translates in Spanish
"black rocks."

97
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:49,089
The border town
in the Texas side is Eagle Pass.

98
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,392
He travels
approximately 35 miles

99
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,598
to the semiarid lands
between the Nueces River

100
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,466
and the Rio Grande.

101
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,037
Artesian water has
just been found,

102
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,939
and they're recruiting

103
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,476
Mexican laborers to come in
and work in the area.

104
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,980
And this is the beginning
of the three generations,

105
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:18,852
because he homesteaded in this
area called the Winter Garden.

106
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,321
And the reason they call it
the Winter Garden,

107
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,724
and these are four counties

108
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,593
that I'll show you a census map
so you can see

109
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,663
the growth of these,
of this area

110
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:34,501
is because they can grow crops
when no one else can,

111
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:38,472
or that is, they converted this
semiarid land into a garden,

112
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,341
this whole four-county area.

113
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,843
And I was born,

114
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,912
and my grandfather
homesteaded that area

115
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,114
that is covered in red.

116
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,083
On the census, you can see

117
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,522
when he gets there
in the early 1900s,

118
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,027
he crosses the border in 1906
in Zavala County.

119
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,864
We're the last county
in the map from left to right.

120
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,267
And these are huge areas
that we're talking about.

121
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:12,005
The area in Zavala County
is almost 800,000 acres,

122
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,511
and there was only 792 people.

123
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,147
So it is a huge track of land.

124
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,051
But look at the
population increase

125
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,453
between 1900s and 1930s.

126
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,989
So there it is.

127
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,860
It goes from less than 1,000
inhabitants to over 10,000.

128
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,695
And of course, two reasons.

129
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,031
Principally, the Mexican
Revolution begins in 1910,

130
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:43,103
and the chaos that follows
after 1910 until the early '20s.

131
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,039
And of course,
the outmigration

132
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,243
of the northern part
of Coahuila.

133
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,378
By the way,
most of the migrants

134
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,648
that are coming
into the southern part of Texas

135
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,849
that we're talking about

136
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,784
are from
the neighboring states,

137
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,855
Coahuila and the
northern Mexican states.

138
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:08,795
This phenomena of people coming
in from Central America

139
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:14,101
and crossing the border
was unheard of at the time.

140
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:17,304
Even folks
from the southern part

141
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,374
of Mexico, there was no,

142
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,777
internally,
there was no migration.

143
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,947
Most of the folks that were
coming across the border

144
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,815
were from the northern states,

145
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,985
in particular
the state of Coahuila,

146
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,721
that shared a lot
of commonalities

147
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,323
with the state of Texas,

148
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,926
as at one time
they were joined.

149
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,662
Now, after the 1930s to 2006,

150
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,600
you'll see
the population levels out.

151
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,735
Actually it continues to grow,

152
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,772
but there's so much outmigration
that is going on

153
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,640
that it actually stays the same.

154
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,776
That is, people are moving in,

155
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,011
but as many people
that are moving in

156
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,414
are people moving out also.

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,717
And you'll see
when I show you another map

158
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,653
of the,
what will eventually be called

159
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,056
the Midwestern migrant stream,

160
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:14,027
there will be over 100,000
migrant seasonal workers

161
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,198
coming from this area
into the Great Lakes region.

162
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,535
So this amount of people that
we're seeing here,

163
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:25,606
10,000 from Zavala County,
La Salle, Frio, and Dimmit,

164
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,609
does not really depict
the amount of people

165
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,111
that are coming through
the borders

166
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,181
and into the Great Lakes region.

167
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,284
When we, the third generation,

168
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,154
when I spent 10 years
as a migrant worker,

169
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,824
there were over 100,000
migrant workers coming

170
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,526
into the Great Lakes region.

171
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:49,696
Into the state of Wisconsin,
there were 15,000 of us coming,

172
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:54,334
over 5,000 of us
into the central Wisconsin area.

173
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,704
Now, there are
a couple of things

174
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,740
that we want
to just touch upon.

175
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,942
The Great Depression

176
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,546
just dislocates
this whole settlement

177
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,582
that had been going on
for the last two decades.

178
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,919
And of course, the Republican
candidate for president

179
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,421
is talking
about this massive amount

180
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,891
of deportations
that he wants to undertake

181
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,295
for the immigrants
in this country.

182
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,897
I don't know exactly
how he's going to do it.

183
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,868
There's over 60,000 Latinos,
and 25% of us

184
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,972
have someone that is
undocumented in the family.

185
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,473
But we'll see.

186
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,345
But there was, at that time
of the Great Depression,

187
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,849
Mexicans were the scapegoated

188
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,485
for the Great Depression,
and there was a repatriation.

189
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,487
And then the schizophrenia

190
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,924
of the immigration policies
will change,

191
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,494
and you'll see, when
the Second World War starts

192
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:58,332
in the beginning of the 1940s,
there is a need for manpower.

193
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,534
So we make a treaty
with the United States

194
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,070
and the so-called Bracero Act,
or the guest worker.

195
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,773
Mexican workers will
be recruited to come in

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,545
and help us while our men
and women are in uniform.

197
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,047
And then lastly,
the rooting of apartheid.

198
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,083
There is a system of segregation

199
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,785
that is established
during this period of time,

200
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,054
that is, during
the Great Depression

201
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:26,326
in my generation, and I want
to touch upon that also.

202
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,595
This is the,
these are pictures taken

203
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,898
by the Farmers Service
Administration.

204
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,166
You can go into the Internet

205
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,770
and find these
and other images of the poverty,

206
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:40,807
of the malnutrition, of the
sickness, untreated sicknesses.

207
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,776
I selected these two

208
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,445
because there was
a photographer

209
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,215
that came to our hometown
in the 1930s.

210
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,017
So these are pictures
of my community.

211
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,819
These are pictures of,
the one on the left,

212
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,421
I wouldn't even call this
a home.

213
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,323
I call this a shelter

214
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,226
because it's just a makeshift
shelter for the migrants

215
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,094
that are coming in.

216
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,564
We still had,
in my generation,

217
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,068
still had adobe structures,
dirt floors, et cetera.

218
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,903
And that's what you have
on the image

219
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,307
on the right-hand,
upper right-hand column.

220
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,144
That is a grandmother and a
grandchild heating themselves.

221
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,447
And that's the way
we heated ourselves in my time,

222
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,650
that is,
in the late '40s and 1950s.

223
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,720
We would burn mesquite outside,

224
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:32,793
bring the coals inside the home,
put some dirt,

225
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,932
three or four inches
of dirt in the bathtub,

226
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,734
and then put the coals on top,

227
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,537
and everybody sitting
around the bathtub

228
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:44,705
heating themself.

229
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,006
One of the questions was,

230
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,442
"Well, weren't you concerned
about carbon monoxide?"

231
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,778
The windows were so drafty,
the doors were so

232
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,081
that we didn't
have to worry about air,

233
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,049
fresh air coming in.

234
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,853
This is
a picture of the repatriation.

235
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,589
And I just, this occurred
between the Depression,

236
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,859
that is, in 1929
until the late '30s,

237
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:10,130
and we don't know exactly
how many people were deported.

238
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:14,434
I've seen data
from 500,000 to over 2 million.

239
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,104
But, of course,

240
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,806
the problem was that
the Mexicans were blamed

241
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,643
for the economic downturn
and the loss of jobs,

242
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,611
and they were repatriated.

243
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,947
And really, the term
"repatriation"

244
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,483
is not an appropriate term

245
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,686
because most
of the children and youngsters

246
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,622
that you see in these pictures
were born in the United States.

247
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,258
They weren't repatriated.

248
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:42,196
And, of course,
as I indicated earlier,

249
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:47,301
during the Second World War
and the scarcity of workers,

250
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,269
there's a treaty
with the United States,

251
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,105
and braceros,
male workers, guest.

252
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,175
Bracero from the word <i>brazo,</i>
right,

253
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,079
as some of you that know Spanish
know the term.

254
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:02,049
And you see the,
during the war,

255
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,819
and I've done some research
on this topic.

256
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,323
During the war, only about
40,000 or 50,000 braceros

257
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,458
are coming
into the United States.

258
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,393
The Mexican government

259
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,997
didn't want to send braceros
into the state of Texas

260
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,165
because of the maltreatment

261
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,834
of the native
Mexican Americans,

262
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,637
but eventually, they conceded
after a couple of years.

263
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,607
But look at
after the world war,

264
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,343
when the economic boom,

265
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,680
we're bringing hundreds
of thousands of braceros.

266
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,849
Two things occur
as a result of this.

267
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,119
The processors that are bringing
the foreign workers, one,

268
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,956
to keep the wages down
and to break the unions,

269
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:47,127
to stop the the
farmworker unionization.

270
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,329
Just a couple of shots.

271
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,700
We have the ignominity
of having a prisoner of war camp

272
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,902
in our community,

273
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,905
or that is
a family internment camp.

274
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,307
What to do with the
prisoner of war camps

275
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,909
after the Second World War?

276
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,477
A great and ideal place

277
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:06,513
for a segregated
elementary school for Mexicans.

278
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,683
So my brothers and I
went to the,

279
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,853
that building in the foreground,
and I chose this picture

280
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,822
because of the,
that was my elementary school

281
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,625
from first through fifth grade.

282
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,261
And I found a picture there.

283
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,764
They named the school--

284
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,066
they wouldn't call it
a former prisoner of war camp,

285
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,336
but there was an airport
that was next door

286
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,938
to the prisoner of war camp

287
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,440
that would bring in supplies,
right?

288
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:36,510
So they named
the segregated school

289
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,145
the Airport Elementary.

290
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,981
So we all went
to the Airport Elementary,

291
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:45,185
not to a former prisoner
or internment camp.

292
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,957
Also, the poll taxes
were instituted

293
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,660
once Mexican Americans became
the majority.

294
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,796
And, of course,
they could take over

295
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,631
any of the local governments

296
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,967
in the four counties
that I indicated.

297
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,869
So my grandfather,

298
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:05,606
I have poll taxes
from 1913, 1915, 1919.

299
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:11,645
And the 1913 were kind of
unable to be read.

300
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,383
And then I found the 1957
from my mom and dad.

301
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,885
So for four decades,

302
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:23,190
Mexican Americans were kept
out of the political process

303
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:28,328
by the charging of poll taxes
for each adult member.

304
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,063
Now, I don't know

305
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,501
who my grandfather voted for
or if he voted,

306
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:36,270
but the reason
that it was instituted

307
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,472
was to prevent them
from participating

308
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:39,940
in the political process.

309
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,342
So he was, like,
a walking-around target

310
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,945
when they found out that
he and some of his neighbors

311
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,247
were paying poll taxes.

312
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:54,788
Well, the Great Depression
and the working conditions,

313
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:58,959
including the conditions of
segregation and maltreatment

314
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,795
of the Mexican Americans
initiates a migration.

315
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,531
I have this map, and the spot,

316
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,101
that red spot in the middle
of Texas,

317
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:11,471
that's that Winter Garden area
that I indicated to you

318
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,340
a little bit earlier.

319
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:17,211
You can see how it spreads out
into other areas.

320
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:21,615
That is, my wife's family
used to go straight up

321
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:26,453
now present-day
Interstate 35 into the Dakotas,

322
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,555
in between the river,
Red River Valley,

323
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,792
between the Dakotas
and Minnesota.

324
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,494
You can see some of them
went to Florida

325
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,363
and then joined
the migrant stream

326
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,498
up and down
the Atlantic seaboard.

327
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,901
Others would go
into the Northwest

328
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,971
or up and down the
Pacific Coast.

329
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:49,042
But we came primarily
to the Midwest.

330
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,279
And the first stop
that we made

331
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:58,218
was the harvesting
of asparagus in Henry, Illinois.

332
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,521
Then we would go to hoeing
and thinning sugar beets

333
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,989
in Hartford, Wisconsin,

334
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,626
before herbicides
and planters were,

335
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,831
the technology
was made available

336
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,168
so they could space the
sugar beets and other crops,

337
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,103
and you didn't
have to thin them out.

338
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,771
But after hoeing
and thinning sugar beets,

339
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,441
we'd go to central Wisconsin
to the cucumber harvest

340
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,611
into the Waushara
and Portage County area.

341
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:26,747
And then in early September,

342
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,750
the Lower Lakes region
to do the tomato harvest

343
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,585
until the frost
would chase us down,

344
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:35,022
early cotton harvest
in the upper Mississippi Delta,

345
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:39,092
and then the late cotton harvest
in Lubbock, Texas,

346
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,495
or that is the Panhandle.

347
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,831
My dad, the second generation
of migrant workers.

348
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:49,903
There's my dad in Milwaukee
in 1942 with his buddies.

349
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,307
They had found
the Milwaukee barrio

350
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,475
and they were out
having a great time.

351
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,477
My mother joined my father.

352
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,147
He had come in as a young man
with some of these fellows

353
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,548
in the late '30s,

354
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,651
but he got married to my mother
after my first,

355
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,187
my older brother was born.

356
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:11,658
He, an infant, my brother
joined him and his uncles,

357
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,027
and they made it up
to Hartford, Wisconsin,

358
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,463
to hoe and thin sugar beets.

359
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,600
And lo and behold,
the war, 1941,

360
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,269
of course, the Japanese
attack Pearl Harbor

361
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,670
and the Second World War starts.

362
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:27,641
So in 1942, my uncle is hoeing
and thinning sugar beets.

363
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,643
And I believe
the Selective Service

364
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,245
is in Fond du Lac
at that time.

365
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,479
I don't know why.

366
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,916
But he signs up
for the Selective Service,

367
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,117
and he gets a letter

368
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,053
that he's being called
to report for service.

369
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,523
So they rush back to Texas,
and they said,

370
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,058
"No, no, no,
you signed up in Wisconsin.

371
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,194
"You have to go back
to Wisconsin.

372
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:48,862
You're going with the
Red Arrow Division."

373
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:53,300
So you can see that symbol
in my uncle's shoulder there,

374
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,103
where he serves
with the Red Arrow Division

375
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,374
in the Pacific, including
the occupation of Japan.

376
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,875
And this is
the third generation.

377
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,344
That's my mom and dad
at the Waushara County Fair.

378
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,079
We're harvesting cucumbers.

379
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,249
And there's the workforce
on the right-hand side.

380
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,653
I would ask you, if we had time,
to see if you could identify me.

381
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,655
- Audience Member: Yeah.
- Jesus: But on the top...

382
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,956
[laughs]
Somebody says, "Yeah."

383
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:18,325
On the top, from left to right,
is my brother Manuel,

384
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:22,262
then Carlos, and I'm
in the last one on the right.

385
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,131
And then
the three younger ones,

386
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,968
Francisco, Luis, and the
far right is my brother Rudy.

387
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:32,706
And we, the farmers here
in the state of Wisconsin,

388
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,311
very few of them built housing
for migrant workers.

389
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,647
We were housed
in every conceivable structure

390
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,183
that you can find
in a farm lot, right?

391
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,987
I'm talking about barns,
sheds, warehouses, et cetera.

392
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:50,591
I choose this one because
it's really unique.

393
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,461
[chuckles]
I hope some of you youngsters

394
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,632
don't take my remarks
to heart, but...

395
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,334
In the following remarks,

396
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,505
but we grow great cannabis here
in the state of Wisconsin.

397
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,840
During the Second World War

398
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:09,843
when the Japanese
take over the Philippines,

399
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,546
we can no longer get
manila rope,

400
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,214
which was used
by the United States Navy.

401
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:17,651
So where are we gonna get the
rope for the United States Navy?

402
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,520
So they did an analysis,

403
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,723
and they built half a dozen
of these hemp plants

404
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,427
in the state of Wisconsin
to develop the fiber

405
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,764
to be able to provide the Navy
with the rope that they needed.

406
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:35,002
What to do with the
industrial hemp plants?

407
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,403
Housing for migrant workers.

408
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,673
The first three years that
we came, that's where we lived.

409
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,842
And the only saving grace
about this,

410
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,577
it's the only place
in the 10 years

411
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,613
that we ever went
that we had hot water.

412
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,549
Of course, we had to all shower

413
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,084
bare-ass in front
of strangers that we never met.

414
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,320
But other than that,
it was great.

415
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:56,390
It was really noisy
because it was built--

416
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,660
these cavernous,
you know, multistory buildings,

417
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,361
plywood on, you know,

418
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,665
every eight feet
there were a unit.

419
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,835
And of course,
there were six of us--

420
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,837
I showed you the picture
of my brothers and I--

421
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:11,004
and my mom and dad.

422
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,840
So we occupied
two of those units.

423
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:16,009
And every time we opened up,
the plywood hitting the door,

424
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,311
it was just noisy.

425
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,645
And you know,

426
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,815
if it was a rainy day
and then everybody,

427
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,284
all the children in the middle
of this cavernous buildings,

428
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,254
because the units were
on the side.

429
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,655
So that was really,
like I said,

430
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,524
the only saving grace was the,

431
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:34,027
that we actually had warm water
to bathe.

432
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:38,031
This was the hoeing and thinning
of, I think this is cucumber.

433
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:40,033
Yeah, this is cucumber,
cucumber plants.

434
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,702
And this is the long hoe.

435
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,771
Because, you saw the age
of my brothers and I,

436
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,740
what our parents used to do

437
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,676
is cut the hoe
to 12 to 18 inches.

438
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,679
They called it <i>el cortito,</i>
right, the "short one."

439
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:56,049
And then, we had no strength
in the upper part of the body,

440
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:59,052
so we hoed and thinned
sugar beets, cucumbers,

441
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,687
whatever the crop was.

442
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:03,223
Using the hoe,
of course, is backbreaking,

443
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,125
backbreaking your back.

444
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:07,794
I talk extensively about
the work

445
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:10,531
in the first part of the book.

446
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:14,868
As I told you,
the different schools

447
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:18,572
that I attended,
my father and my parents

448
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,641
were insistent that

449
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,376
we were not gonna have
a fourth generation

450
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,478
of migrant workers,
and he put us,

451
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:28,215
everywhere we went,
we were enrolled in school.

452
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,251
I was telling the young man
that's sitting in the back there

453
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:35,722
that I went to three different
schools during the school year.

454
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,026
And this is
the asparagus harvest.

455
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,061
I went to school
in Henry, Illinois.

456
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:44,331
In Waushara County, I went to
school in Wautoma High School.

457
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:47,167
In Crystal City,
of course my hometown,

458
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:50,704
I went to school
in Crystal City High School.

459
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,440
So I graduated
from eighth grade

460
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,375
in Henry, Illinois.

461
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:58,011
And I got a
completely different perspective

462
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,780
about life in general,

463
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:04,251
whereas, in Texas, I never sat
in a classroom with somebody

464
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,619
that wasn't a Mexican.

465
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,354
Even after 1955,

466
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:10,991
after the picture I showed you,
that was 1954.

467
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:17,297
In 1954, the Supreme Court
orders the school desegregation,

468
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:21,368
so I was, I went to the
desegregated schools

469
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,637
in Crystal City, Texas.

470
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,305
We were all
in the same building,

471
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,808
but here's the way
they integrated the schools.

472
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,345
There was 6-1, 6-2,
6-3, 6-4, and 6-5.

473
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,249
The non-Latinos were in 6-1.

474
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:39,219
Some of the Latinos
and Anglos were in 6-2.

475
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:43,657
All the rest of us
were 6-3, 6-4, and 6-5.

476
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:44,825
We're in the same building,

477
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:47,327
but I never went to school
with anybody

478
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,630
that wasn't Mexican
until I got here.

479
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:54,601
And then to be invited to,
on Sundays with my friends.

480
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,940
There's a picture that I have.

481
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,642
I won't show you,

482
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:06,380
but I met this young woman
by the name of Toni Booth,

483
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:11,318
and she was in the
eighth grade graduation picture,

484
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:14,655
and we were dancing
after the graduation.

485
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,392
There's a picture of Toni and I
dancing.

486
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:23,497
Just something, just two
young folks dancing,

487
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,232
but something
that was completely,

488
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,636
by custom and by law,
prohibited by law in Texas

489
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:32,339
is going on here
in Henry, Illinois.

490
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,408
So just as an example.

491
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,111
That had a lot
to do with my orientation

492
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,047
in a very positive way.

493
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:41,882
Well, I returned
to the migrant camps

494
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,017
because I graduated
from Wautoma High School,

495
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:46,520
attend school just
for about a year

496
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,889
at Oshkosh State at that time.

497
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:51,124
I was behind
'cause, you know,

498
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:55,195
it took me years to catch up
to a level, but--

499
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,932
and I only went for about a year
and a half

500
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:03,337
because the venue for a
successful relocation

501
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,174
was a small restaurant

502
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:11,111
in downtown Wautoma,
just six or seven tables.

503
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:15,849
The owner of the restaurant had
hung herself in the kitchen,

504
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,852
poor woman, and nobody wanted
to get in.

505
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,455
And here my dad said,
"Oh, what a great opportunity."

506
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,457
I said, "Dad, you're not
serious.

507
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:24,892
"We're not gonna go in there.

508
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,727
"It's empty,
nobody wants to go in there.

509
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,462
That lady hung herself."

510
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,097
And here, no, here we go,

511
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,266
making tacos
in central Wisconsin.

512
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:34,434
And I'm waiting on tables,

513
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:38,405
and somebody comes over
in a suit and says,

514
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:41,041
"Are you one of the Salases that
used to be a migrant worker?

515
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:43,177
"Can you take us
to the migrant labor camps?

516
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:46,980
We have a demonstration program
for child care services."

517
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,615
So here I am.

518
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:50,150
And for the next three years,

519
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,052
we have
this demonstration program

520
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,721
in Red Granite, Wisconsin,
for child care.

521
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,391
And for the next three years,
working in child care centers.

522
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:01,395
Then in 1965, a federal grant
makes available

523
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,530
United Migrant
Opportunity Service

524
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:05,699
to provide child care centers

525
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,668
for migrants
in the state of Texas.

526
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,270
By the way, it's still going on.

527
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:13,040
But it returned me
to the labor camps,

528
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:15,843
and of course I had been
working alongside these workers.

529
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,344
And this is
where the union starts,

530
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,079
because for the first time,

531
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:22,382
people start telling me, "Oh,
Jesus, this is what's going on.

532
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:23,550
We're not getting paid."

533
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,485
You know,
here I'm talking to them

534
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,287
about getting the kids
out of the field

535
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:28,956
and sending them to school,

536
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,859
and they're telling me
about not getting paid properly,

537
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,260
the problems with the housing,

538
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,429
injuries in the field,
et cetera.

539
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:39,199
And then the other thing that--
what did I do?

540
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,801
The other thing,
oh, there we go.

541
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,737
The other thing
that occurs in 1963,

542
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:47,140
my hometown,
the Mexican Americans

543
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:49,443
obtained a franchise,

544
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,713
and they conduct
what Professor Shockley

545
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,915
from the University
of Wisconsin-Madison

546
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:58,385
calls a political revolt
in a south Texas town.

547
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,920
By the way, that's a book

548
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:03,257
by Professor Shockley
and UW-Madison.

549
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,759
And there starts
a political revolt.

550
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:10,030
So I start going back,
the return to the labor camps

551
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:14,234
and the political revolt occurs
before my orientation

552
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,670
and my organizing
of farmworkers.

553
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:20,741
So just to give you an idea that
I didn't go back immediately

554
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,709
and start organizing
farmworkers.

555
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:26,914
There were a number
of events that occurred.

556
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,816
One of them is that

557
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:33,453
on the fourth year
of working with this

558
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:37,024
child care programs, et cetera,

559
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,661
somebody brings me a paper
from California,

560
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,663
and he says, "Hey, look what

561
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:45,599
"this guy by the name of
Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta

562
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,134
in California are doing."

563
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,803
They're marching
from Sacramento,

564
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,073
from Delano to Sacramento,
protesting the working

565
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,742
and living conditions
of the grape workers

566
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,478
who were on strike in Delano.

567
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,348
And I said, "That's what we need
to do to start changing."

568
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,250
'Cause I'd been
working four years now,

569
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,985
10 years as a migrant worker,

570
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:08,856
four years, you know, trying to
improve their working conditions

571
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,824
by working with their families
and children,

572
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,092
and it wasn't working.

573
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,594
So here we go.

574
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,030
We're gonna organize
a protest march from Wautoma,

575
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:20,100
80 miles to Madison, Wisconsin.

576
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:23,570
I was afraid because the,
I was afraid that the,

577
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,606
the way the,
that I knew the workers

578
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,407
were treating the migrants,

579
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:29,710
that if we organized
a protest march,

580
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:32,646
those families would be
thrown out of their labor camps.

581
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,716
So we did <i>"Juntarnos para</i>
<i>ser reconocidos,"</i>

582
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,484
that top sentence,

583
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,419
"Let's get together
to be recognized."

584
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:42,990
<i>"Hablar para ser oidos,"</i>
"Let's speak to be heard."

585
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,993
<i>"La raza tiene causa,"</i>
"Our people have a cause."

586
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,962
Notice there's no locations,
there's no date for the rally

587
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,431
'cause we're gonna have
a rally in order

588
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:54,935
to get volunteers to participate
in the 80-mile march.

589
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,471
And this is the only way
we can do it

590
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:01,608
without letting
anybody know what is going on

591
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:05,779
except ourselves, 'cause
it's all done by word of mouth,

592
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:07,281
except the Catholic priests

593
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:10,350
that allowed me to use
a former parish hall

594
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,886
in order for the union
to meet.

595
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:15,489
So here we are,
hundreds of people show up.

596
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:17,191
We do with the little poster.

597
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:21,595
And this is the rally,
and we got several dozen.

598
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:24,164
We only--
this is really something.

599
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,332
There's a question,

600
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,001
once you see the marchers
in the next picture,

601
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,436
"Where are the women?"

602
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:30,771
And I said, "You know,

603
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,173
"when I'm up there
asking for people to march,

604
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,276
we're afraid to include women
in the march."

605
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,778
"You shouldn't have been."

606
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:39,580
And I said, "Well, we were
at the time."

607
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:40,981
This is 1966.

608
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:45,719
And we only asked for
male participants to come up,

609
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:49,857
and it was 80 miles, and we were
gonna walk 20 miles,

610
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:51,191
20 miles a day.

611
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:53,293
There were
no sanitary facilities,

612
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,729
nor did we have any--
it was going to

613
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,931
just on the side of the road
kind of a thing.

614
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:02,436
So you see the pre-Columbian
eagle of Chavez there.

615
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:03,604
Kind of crude.

616
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,807
And underneath it, Chavez
allowed me to use NFWA,

617
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,843
which was the name of the
farmworkers at that time,

618
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,412
the National
Farm Workers Association.

619
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,415
So here we're demanding just
the enforcement of the--

620
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,852
Wisconsin had some of the
wonderful social legislation

621
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,287
that few states had.

622
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:22,489
We had a minimum wage
that covered migrant workers.

623
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:25,259
We had a housing code
that covered migrant workers.

624
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,728
We had workmen's compensation
that they're not gonna exclude.

625
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:28,896
But it wasn't enforced.

626
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,898
So the first part
of this organizing

627
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:34,768
was to get the enforcement
of these laws.

628
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,671
We're...

629
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:41,842
The canning companies
in the area, after the march,

630
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,844
thought it was, like,
a call to arms.

631
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,413
People here
at this potato processing plant.

632
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,582
"Oh, Jesus used to see
the problems

633
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:51,485
that we're having at this
potato processing plant."

634
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,220
This is in Almond, Wisconsin.

635
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:57,257
This is the James Burns
processing company.

636
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:01,261
And so I didn't know
how to organize a union,

637
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:04,731
but at that time
that we're on strike,

638
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,069
the local brewer from Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, John Schmidt,

639
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:11,438
ascends to the state AFL-CIO.

640
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,241
He invites me
to the state AFL-CIO

641
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:17,211
that inaugurates his candidacy,

642
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:20,314
and he provides me with a lawyer
and says, "No, Jesus, two ways.

643
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,983
Either you have an election
or you have membership cards."

644
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,587
So we start signing--
this is John Schmidt.

645
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,422
We start signing
membership cards.

646
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:31,758
The processor
finds out about them,

647
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:35,495
and he has
the workers sign an affidavit

648
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,898
that they don't belong
to the union.

649
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:40,734
And if they don't sign it,
they get fired anyway,

650
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:43,504
just like
saying they belong to the union.

651
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,840
We have Wisconsin Employment
Relations Commission

652
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,342
that covers migrant workers.

653
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,676
By the way,

654
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,678
when the industrial workers get
the rights to a union,

655
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,648
they exclude domestic workers,
they exclude the farmworkers,

656
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:56,884
they exclude other groups.

657
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,886
The only two states in the Union

658
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:01,421
that farmworkers
can organize legally:

659
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:03,457
the state of Wisconsin
and Hawaii.

660
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:06,660
So we're the only ones
in the continental United States

661
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,396
that can organize legally
a union.

662
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:13,867
So I complained to the Wisconsin
Employment Relations Commission.

663
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:17,671
And I didn't know how it works,
and it takes months.

664
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:21,308
This isn't until we complain
and they don't get heard.

665
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,110
This is in October.

666
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:26,947
They don't have a hearing
until 12/15/1966.

667
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,116
Most of the workers can't
hang around for the hearing,

668
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:31,485
but we convince two
or three families to stay

669
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:34,821
so they can testify
about the mistreatment.

670
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:38,158
And the Wisconsin Employment
Relations Commission

671
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:41,428
finds James Burns
unlawful interference,

672
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,330
unfair labor practice.

673
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:45,098
So now we're in the books.

674
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,235
So we continue organizing
farmworkers with the support

675
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:51,471
of John Schmidt, in the picture
that I just showed you.

676
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:52,639
And what do we do?

677
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,241
We start organizing
cucumber workers.

678
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,476
So we go after the
multinational,

679
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,245
after Libby, McNeill, and Libby.

680
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,781
And now that we got
a mouthpiece, right, we say,

681
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:04,685
"All right, why don't you,
don't go out on strike

682
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,453
"because you'll get
your workers fired

683
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,922
"like you did
in the potato processing plant

684
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,557
"for not showing up to work.

685
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:12,826
"Do a walkout during
the noon hour.

686
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:15,028
"That's their right
to be able not to be at work

687
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:16,597
"during the noon hour.

688
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:20,267
"And then call for an emergency
hearing of that same agency

689
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:23,804
that heard you last December
so that you can get a vote."

690
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:28,108
And we win the certification
election 405-8.

691
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:32,513
And I'm sure those eight
were errors

692
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,048
'cause we had
the unanimous support

693
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,017
of the farmworkers.

694
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:40,854
Well, I just want to show you
just very rapidly

695
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:42,656
what kind of union
we established,

696
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:44,758
because we didn't have
very many resources,

697
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,593
but I'll show you.

698
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,096
Because the only organization
that I had any experience--

699
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,631
I had never belonged to a union,

700
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,633
but I belonged
to a mutual aid society

701
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,636
because that was the only
organization that was allowed

702
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,605
under apartheid
in Crystal City, Texas.

703
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:03,010
So the mutual aid society
was a funeral society

704
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,116
that handled the burial
of the Mexicans

705
00:34:09,183 --> 00:34:11,084
in the city of Crystal City.

706
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,187
And it was a benevolent.

707
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,055
It was
a dues-paying organization.

708
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:16,390
That's what we need to do.

709
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:18,525
Obreros Unidos is gonna be
a dues-paying

710
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:21,495
membership organization,
a benevolent society.

711
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,464
So this is what inspired me
about it.

712
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,934
We published a newspaper,
<i>La Voz Mexicana.</i>

713
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,937
Here we are selling
the newspaper in downtown.

714
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,372
Isn't that a great picture
of that youngster,

715
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:37,811
barefooted, selling the
newspaper, <i>La Voz Mexicana?</i>

716
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,250
Fred Kessler, assemblyman
from the Milwaukee area,

717
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:47,087
helped me organize a group
of about half a dozen lawyers

718
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:50,324
to come up and get
this Wisconsin legislation

719
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,859
to be enforced,

720
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:55,295
filing minimum wage complaints,
filing workmen's compensation,

721
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:57,698
filing complaints
under housing conditions.

722
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:01,935
And there's Allen Samson there,
standing in a white shirt.

723
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:06,139
And the gentleman that's raising
his hand is Michael McCann,

724
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,308
who'd just graduated
from Harvard

725
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,277
and eventually would become

726
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:13,814
a district attorney
for the county of Milwaukee

727
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,816
for the next 20-some years,

728
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:18,886
taking the oath
of individuals.

729
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,856
I had been going back
and forth to Madison

730
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:24,758
because that's
where the funds came from

731
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:28,695
during the years that
I worked in the daycare centers.

732
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,531
And I met this wonderful woman
by the name

733
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:33,267
of Elizabeth Brandeis
Raushenbush.

734
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,136
At that time, the university
hospitals were tied

735
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,638
with the University
of Wisconsin,

736
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:40,407
so we had a reception to raise
funds for migrant workers.

737
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,210
And this doctor
by the name of Dr. Goodfriend

738
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:45,812
showed up at the reception,

739
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:50,317
and we were talking about health
conditions and the lack of--

740
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:54,521
and he said, "You know
that we have a blue bus?

741
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,425
"There is a STD epidemic

742
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,828
"that is going on here
among the students

743
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:04,464
"at the University of Wisconsin
at Madison,

744
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:06,667
"and we have the blue bus
and we take it over,

745
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,268
"and we park it
up on Mifflin Street.

746
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,870
"But it's a whole laboratory.

747
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:12,039
"And why don't you find me
a place in Wautoma,

748
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:14,741
"and we'll open up a clinic
and we'll do analysis,

749
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:16,844
blood testing, X-rays,
whatever."

750
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,645
And here we go.

751
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:22,316
That's the bus right next to the
parish hall they opened up.

752
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,351
By the way, 50 years later,
it's still going on.

753
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:25,853
It doesn't
look like that anymore.

754
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,888
It's a huge, huge complex.

755
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:30,290
But that's Dr. Goodfriend,

756
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,793
medical students,
interns, et cetera.

757
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,163
They would do the analysis,
the intake at the parish hall,

758
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,367
and then they would do
the testing inside the bus.

759
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,703
And that's actually the bus
where that takes place.

760
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:44,304
We opened up a gasoline co-op

761
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,039
because soon as
the migrants came in,

762
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:47,741
all the prices of gasoline
would come in

763
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:49,610
and the workers
wouldn't have any place

764
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:52,012
to change the oil
and take care of the vehicles.

765
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,148
So this place was empty,
and we opened up a co-op,

766
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,918
and you had to be a member,
and you got--

767
00:36:57,985 --> 00:37:01,788
look at the price
of that gasoline in 1968, huh?

768
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,524
31 cents a gallon.

769
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,592
And they were making money
out of that,

770
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:06,760
so you can believe that.

771
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,562
But there are a couple
of things that happened

772
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:11,365
that got us involved,
and not sidetracked,

773
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:12,699
but got us involved.

774
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:15,936
Eva Valenzuela, on the
left-hand side of that picture,

775
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:18,739
was wearing our button, our
union button, Obreros Unidos.

776
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:20,340
And she was working
for Jon Wilcox,

777
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,276
who was the assemblyman
from the area.

778
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,278
By the way, later named

779
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,281
by Tommy Thompson to the
to the Wisconsin Supreme Court,

780
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:29,283
to get an idea of kind of

781
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,251
Supreme Court justice
he was.

782
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:33,954
He fires his family
for wearing a union button

783
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,190
in the labor camp, right?

784
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:40,494
And so we set up a tent city
right by the downtown park

785
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:41,962
of Wautoma.

786
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:43,130
He said, "Any other people

787
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:45,332
"that you fire
for being union members,

788
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:48,168
"we're gonna fill the whole
doggone town full of tents.

789
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:49,570
"He said, 'So it's up to you.

790
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:51,171
"'You want to
keep on firing migrant workers

791
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,372
who are a member the union.'"

792
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,274
And Eva,
just a courageous woman.

793
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,778
She would, for the next couple
of Saturdays,

794
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,315
would led rallies
on behalf of people

795
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,585
wearing their union buttons.

796
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:05,752
And attended by families.

797
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,321
You can see both...

798
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,289
I have another picture
of that.

799
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:11,325
There were so many children
that would show up

800
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,760
that we had to have treats
with them

801
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:18,165
just to keep them occupied
during the rallies.

802
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:21,668
And remember that election
that I showed you

803
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,570
that we won 405-8?

804
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:26,540
Libby,
instead of negotiating

805
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:30,244
over the 700 workers
in that three-county area,

806
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,846
moved their operations
out of state.

807
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:35,649
And just like a lot
of industries,

808
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:38,719
this is going on throughout the
state of Wisconsin, by the way,

809
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:41,355
where union workers
are losing their jobs,

810
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:44,291
and they're moving industrial
and manufacturing jobs

811
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:46,593
are going down South
to right-to-work states

812
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,162
where they don't
have to face unions.

813
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,698
And that work is too cheap.

814
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:57,104
They go across Mexico
and into Asia eventually

815
00:38:58,038 --> 00:39:00,874
in order to avoid paying workers
their due wages.

816
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,544
But here, we're trying
to force Libby to come back

817
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,446
to the negotiating tables
and sign an agreement,

818
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,749
but they refuse to do so.

819
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,851
So, finally, Chavez tells me,

820
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:13,520
"Look, you're doing a great job,
but this is your fourth year,

821
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,889
"and you still don't have
a contract.

822
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:18,358
"Why don't you help us
get a contract in California?

823
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,861
And once we get the,"
he's doing,

824
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:22,563
we both started the same year.

825
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:24,431
"Once we get the contract
in California,

826
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:27,467
then I'll come back to Wisconsin
and help you get yours."

827
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,836
I believed him, right?

828
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:30,270
Who was supposed to know

829
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:32,506
that grape boycott was
gonna go on for five years?

830
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:33,674
All right.

831
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,176
But anyway,
here goes Jesus Salas

832
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:40,347
to Milwaukee
to organize a grape boycott.

833
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,316
Father John Maurice

834
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:47,221
had the archdiocese-funded
Centro Hispano host us

835
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,023
in the back room there
to run the grape boycott.

836
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,659
And here he introduces us
at a Mass.

837
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,628
"Are you sure, Father,
that it's all right

838
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:55,796
if I go up there?"

839
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,531
We're all wearing
the thunderbird symbol

840
00:39:57,598 --> 00:39:58,699
of the farmworkers.

841
00:39:58,765 --> 00:39:59,933
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,735
We just want to introduce you
to the community."

843
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:02,903
"Okay."

844
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,104
What is going on
in Milwaukee?

845
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,706
They've been marching
for the last two years

846
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,307
for an ordinance
of open housing.

847
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:10,544
So here we have an intersection
with the farmworkers

848
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,780
and the civil rights movement
in Milwaukee.

849
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:16,917
And Father Groppi
and I become close,

850
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:20,387
and here
in front of Kohl's Food Store.

851
00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:22,823
Very few people know
that Senator Kohl's family

852
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,159
kept us out in the cold there
for months.

853
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,228
He wouldn't take his grapes
off the table.

854
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,163
But that's another story.

855
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,432
Father Groppi tells, "Jesus,
you're doing a great job.

856
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:33,600
"You got the leaflets going.

857
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:36,837
"You tell people not
to buy grapes, you know,

858
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:39,840
"when they go into the store,
write to the growers,

859
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:42,743
"you know, to negotiate
with the farmworkers.

860
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,479
But you gotta do
something different."

861
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,647
"What is that?"

862
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,515
"Little bit of a direct action."

863
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:49,683
"What is that?"

864
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,084
"Well, go to the
doggone parking lot

865
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:53,587
"and stop the customers
from coming in.

866
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,789
Why do they have to go
into the grocer?"

867
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:57,791
"Well, that's a great idea."

868
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,993
So anyway,
this is what's going on

869
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,428
in the Black civil rights
movement.

870
00:41:01,495 --> 00:41:03,397
These are the tactics
that they're using.

871
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:06,466
Well, to make
a long story short,

872
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,503
we get a little bit
of direct action

873
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,405
and we get thrown in jail.

874
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:13,941
But we don't know anything
about getting arrested.

875
00:41:14,007 --> 00:41:15,943
You never want to get arrested
on a Friday night,

876
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:18,078
'cause you have to stay
there until Monday

877
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:21,915
when there's no judges
that adjudicate issues

878
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:23,317
on weekends.

879
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:24,918
You don't wanna do it
without the mouthpiece.

880
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,386
You wanna let lawyers know

881
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:28,021
if you're gonna be
doing some direct action

882
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:29,923
that lead to an arrest.

883
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,925
You wanna have a lawyer handy,
right?

884
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,093
You wanna have some money

885
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,761
because they're
gonna charge you bail.

886
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,163
Otherwise they're
not gonna let you out.

887
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,699
So here we go,
well, anyway.

888
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:41,068
But these are some of my heroes.

889
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:42,936
These are some
of the individuals

890
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,738
that helped me
in the North Side.

891
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,507
That is, from right to left,

892
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,775
Assemblyman Lloyd Barbee,
an attorney,

893
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:52,079
and he sued
the Milwaukee Public Schools

894
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,814
over the desegregate.

895
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:56,683
Vel Phillips,
just an extraordinary woman.

896
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,185
The first African American
to sit

897
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,953
in the Milwaukee City Council.

898
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,756
Orville Pitts,
Milwaukee County supervisor.

899
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:04,725
All of them
are wearing union buttons

900
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,995
and supporting
Obreros Unidos.

901
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,464
And Lloyd
helping me out in the rallies

902
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,799
that we're having
as a master of ceremonies,

903
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,402
integrating rallies
both for Latinos

904
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:18,038
and for African Americans.

905
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,474
And while we're down there,

906
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,877
that agency that I told you
got funded for daycare,

907
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:26,180
United Migrant
Opportunity Services,

908
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:28,749
well, they had, this is part
of the war on poverty

909
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:32,986
that began with Lyndon Johnson
and President Kennedy

910
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:37,357
and the maximum feasibility
of participation by the poor,

911
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:41,028
right, was not being followed
by UMOS.

912
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:45,566
All of the top administrative
positions were non-Latinos.

913
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:46,967
There was no members
of the board

914
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,836
that were migrant
or former migrant workers.

915
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,404
"Come on, Jesus, help us."

916
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,574
To make a long story short,
I did help them.

917
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,243
And what did the non-Latino
administrators do?

918
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,413
They all resigned,
imperiling the funding

919
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:03,750
and hoping that Washington
would send the money to them

920
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:07,654
rather than to the United
Migrant Opportunity Services.

921
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:12,292
But the board supported me
and offered me the job.

922
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,096
So I said, "Look, I'll just take
it for two seasons.

923
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:20,267
"I'm not interested in being
the chief executive officer

924
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,169
"for a poverty program.

925
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:24,171
I wanna get back
to what I was doing."

926
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:25,973
But we reorganized the board

927
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,110
and changed UMOS
into a migrant advocacy.

928
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:33,313
And of course,
the education had,

929
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:38,018
the retraining, changing
the job descriptions, et cetera.

930
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:42,089
We fielded
the first candidate for office,

931
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,260
started doing voter
registration,

932
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:47,427
getting out the vote.

933
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:50,964
This is Dante Navarro
in the middle there.

934
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:52,566
Esequiel Guzman to his right.

935
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:55,903
And then I'm with a taco
in my mouth

936
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,604
beside Esequiel.

937
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:00,007
But we were doing enough work

938
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:01,708
so the governor pays
attention to us.

939
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:03,243
So here we are.

940
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,580
Governor Lucey is touring
the barrio,

941
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,149
and we're finally getting some
attention in terms of that issue

942
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,218
that I was telling you about.

943
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:14,021
But we were a little bit
more anxious to do it.

944
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:15,923
And this is the time

945
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,891
the Republican-dominated
legislature

946
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:20,127
wanted to dismantle the--

947
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:22,629
just like all these wonderful
legislation that we had,

948
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:27,234
there was an extensive support
for helping the indigent.

949
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:28,936
But now
they were changing that.

950
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,637
They were saying
that Mexicans were moving

951
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,206
into Milwaukee, and Blacks,

952
00:44:32,272 --> 00:44:33,874
in order to take
advantage of welfare.

953
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:36,677
Can you believe that,
after 10 years of migrating

954
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,746
as a farmworker and
all the years that we spent

955
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:41,615
supporting migrant workers,

956
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,884
that notion that
we were coming here to Wisconsin

957
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,620
to be on welfare,
just so outside the wall.

958
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:50,591
But the 30 days
before we could receive aid

959
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,393
was crucial,
because that meant

960
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,862
that we couldn't assist
the workers

961
00:44:54,928 --> 00:44:59,600
in the relocation assistance,
and we needed that.

962
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,503
So we marched to Madison,

963
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:06,807
and Groppi and I and three other
welfare recipients got

964
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:11,144
ushered out of there under the
National Guard with bayonets.

965
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:15,883
The Milwaukee welfare
demonstration led to the arrest

966
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:19,186
of Ernesto Chac?n
and Jos? Puente.

967
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,925
And hundreds of people
are marching on our behalf.

968
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:29,162
And after months and thousands
of signatures,

969
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:34,034
I wasn't arrested for any
damages to the, or Groppi,

970
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,272
to the state Capitol.

971
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:40,174
It was a civic--

972
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,743
But some goodhearted person,
never knew who it was,

973
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:45,946
ended up paying for whatever
alleged damage that we did,

974
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:47,681
and we didn't do any.

975
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:50,083
But Governor Lucey
pardoned Chac?n

976
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:54,621
and Puente for their arrest
when they came to the aid.

977
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:56,023
Well, taking over,

978
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:58,492
you know, United Migrant
Opportunity Service,

979
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,863
how could we get those people
to advance in those programs

980
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,731
if they couldn't get
their certificate

981
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:07,100
for teaching in the Milwaukee
Public School system,

982
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,969
if they couldn't apply
for those jobs

983
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,738
or those community agencies
that were taken over

984
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:15,108
because University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

985
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,977
and University
of Wisconsin-Madison

986
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:18,679
was closed to us?

987
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:20,180
The University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,

988
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,549
out of 25,000 students,

989
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:24,751
all of the Latinos
could sit around one table.

990
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:28,055
So first we had to access,
open up the doors,

991
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,691
so that we could get in there

992
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:35,262
and really make our agencies
viable by enrolling in them.

993
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,631
And it took us two years.

994
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:39,333
They would open up
the doors,

995
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:41,101
but they wouldn't conduct
the programs.

996
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:43,003
And the same thing here
in Madison.

997
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,205
They would open up the doors,
but they didn't want to,

998
00:46:45,272 --> 00:46:46,907
they didn't want
the academic courses.

999
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,409
So here we are camping out,

1000
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:52,045
following Groppi's notion
about direct action.

1001
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:53,914
We're protesting.

1002
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,751
After months of picketing,
we decided to sleep outside,

1003
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,186
camp, go on a fast.

1004
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:02,823
And they had
the guards out in the front

1005
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:07,461
of the chancellor's hall,

1006
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:10,097
and so that we could use
the bathroom

1007
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,765
as we were sleeping there.

1008
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,967
And one of the young men

1009
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:17,738
that wanted to use the bathroom
said, "Jesus,

1010
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:21,008
"the guard for the night
has left,

1011
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:25,679
and the guard for the morning is
not here, and the door is open."

1012
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:29,249
So we walked in there and took
all of our blankets in there,

1013
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:30,951
and we started calling up
the phones.

1014
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,619
We didn't go into the
chancellor's office.

1015
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:34,788
It's just to the reception area.

1016
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:37,191
By the time
they found out what we had done,

1017
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:39,927
we had hundreds of folks
in there, as you can see.

1018
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:43,864
And that ended the picketing
and the camping and the fasting

1019
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:46,033
because they agreed
to establish

1020
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,335
the Spanish Speaking
Outreach Institute.

1021
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:52,606
And it's still going on
at this time, 50 years later.

1022
00:47:52,673 --> 00:47:55,375
Here we are celebrating
and planning

1023
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:56,543
what are we gonna do

1024
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,045
with the Spanish Speaking
Outreach Institute?

1025
00:47:58,111 --> 00:48:00,380
And up there in the entrances
of the hall,

1026
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,115
there's hundreds of people here.

1027
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:04,451
This young lady and others
like her,

1028
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:06,954
dressed in Mexican
folkloric costumes,

1029
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,857
come up, take the microphone
from my hand,

1030
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,593
and said, "We're not gonna
put up with you, macho."

1031
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:13,961
"What are you talking about?"

1032
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:18,932
The women are upset that this
male-dominated organizations

1033
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,934
that were set up
and all the activity,

1034
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:23,837
the way we handled this, they're
not gonna put up with it.

1035
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:27,641
And they want,
as part of the planning session,

1036
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,644
an all-women's discussion,
so they can come up

1037
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:32,980
with some recommendations
by the end of the day

1038
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:36,850
that will support
some of their demands.

1039
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:40,888
And there's other pictures
of this activity.

1040
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:43,490
But just to give you an idea
of what

1041
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:46,693
we had to suffer through, right,
in order to,

1042
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,629
but it was a great,
the greatest thing

1043
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:49,830
to happen to our community

1044
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:51,999
because it kept us intact,
right?

1045
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:56,436
This is something that
occurred within the community

1046
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:59,506
and we were all the better
for it.

1047
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:03,677
There's other things
that occurred.

1048
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:07,581
The desegregation of the
Milwaukee Public School system

1049
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:10,450
and the establishing of the--

1050
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:13,353
we demanded
the establishing

1051
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,757
a bilingual programs in the
celebration of Fiestas Patrias,

1052
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:19,426
and they wouldn't do it,
so we started walking out,

1053
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:23,263
emptying all the schools
in the nearby neighborhood

1054
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,265
and marching
on the 16th of September

1055
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,768
and the Cinco de Mayo holiday.

1056
00:49:27,835 --> 00:49:30,137
Now, we didn't invent
the celebrations.

1057
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:31,872
Ever since Mexicans have been
in Milwaukee,

1058
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:34,541
they've been celebrating
on Cinco and the Diecis?is.

1059
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:36,543
But what we did is
we politicized it.

1060
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,246
We used the events
of the Diecis?is

1061
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:40,981
and of the Cinco de Mayo

1062
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:45,319
to advance the issues
that we had in the community.

1063
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:47,454
And look what we would do after
the marches,

1064
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:50,424
just hundreds of folks
would just come in,

1065
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,493
and we would have rallies
afterwards and put our demands

1066
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,563
and get people engaged
in what were the issues

1067
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,765
of the day, including,

1068
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,502
we were a little bit impatient
with Governor Lucey.

1069
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:03,270
He was a good friend of ours,

1070
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,472
but a little impatient
in terms of what was going on.

1071
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:08,242
We wanted the migrant labor law
to be instituted,

1072
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:12,779
and he didn't get the votes
in the first session,

1073
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:17,084
and we decided
that we wanted to picket.

1074
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:20,287
The same thing,
now I'm graduated.

1075
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,924
I left the UMOS
and graduated from UWM.

1076
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:27,594
I'm now enrolled in UW-Madison.

1077
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:32,132
We've been picketing
since 1975 for Chicano studies.

1078
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,268
We've gone through the
whole rigmarole,

1079
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,871
advisory committee's
recommendation, et cetera.

1080
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:39,606
Here's 1983.

1081
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,478
And now this is the second
Letters & Science.

1082
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,480
It was Cronon, now it's Shain.

1083
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:50,551
And we're negotiating
in the next picture.

1084
00:50:51,518 --> 00:50:53,654
The number of people
that he gave us

1085
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,323
to teach academic courses
were not prepared.

1086
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,561
Nobody had ever thought
of a Latino studies course

1087
00:51:00,627 --> 00:51:02,429
or a Chicano studies course.

1088
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:06,133
And we wanted the hiring
to go on, and eventually it did.

1089
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,635
These are collaborations
that we did.

1090
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:10,370
The war is going on.

1091
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:12,773
The Contras in Nicaragua
are being destabilized.

1092
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,509
Reagan orders the invasion
of Grenada,

1093
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,244
following up
on Johnson's invasion

1094
00:51:17,311 --> 00:51:19,279
of the Dominican Republic.

1095
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:23,483
And we're
collaborating with other groups.

1096
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:26,620
And here, in Spanish,
we're saying

1097
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:29,022
the union <i>hace la fuerza,</i>

1098
00:51:29,623 --> 00:51:32,159
or "results in strength"
or "makes strength,"

1099
00:51:32,226 --> 00:51:36,930
in <i>la fuerza a la victoria,</i> or
that "strength to victory."

1100
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:39,366
And these are
the legislative initiatives.

1101
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:43,303
We eventually amended the
University of Wisconsin budget

1102
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,872
to include Chicano studies.

1103
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:48,542
And they were pissed--
excuse me, they were angry.

1104
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:52,346
They were angry that we were
able to have that relationship

1105
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:55,549
with the Democratic Party
to be able to convince them

1106
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:58,819
to amend the University
of Wisconsin-Madison budget

1107
00:51:58,886 --> 00:52:01,922
to include a line item
for $50,000

1108
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:05,092
to begin academic courses
for Latinos.

1109
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:08,795
And initially,
they didn't want that money.

1110
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:11,965
They took, they gave it
to the School of Education.

1111
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:14,134
School of Education
used it for recruiting.

1112
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:16,170
So it took us years
to get it back.

1113
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:21,475
And finally we're, the
University of Wisconsin Regents

1114
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,110
last year proposed

1115
00:52:23,177 --> 00:52:27,981
that the Chicano studies program
be offered a major

1116
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,117
for the first time.

1117
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:35,088
This is a necessary road
in order to get a department,

1118
00:52:37,057 --> 00:52:38,325
so we're on our way.

1119
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:40,994
We passed the migrant labor law
that you saw that march

1120
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:42,829
when we were
a little bit impatient

1121
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:44,264
with the governor.

1122
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:47,901
The Chinese students
in San Francisco

1123
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,171
went to the Supreme Court,
<i>Lau vs. Nichols.</i>

1124
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:53,574
And they said that anyone

1125
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:57,444
with those issues having
to do with a native language

1126
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:59,313
had to be,

1127
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,748
those schools had to
institute a bilingual program.

1128
00:53:01,815 --> 00:53:04,751
So we pursued and instituted

1129
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:07,154
a bicultural, bilingual bill,
and it passed,

1130
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:09,957
and the migrant tuition bill
in 1984.

1131
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:13,160
The first three were done
in the '70s,

1132
00:53:13,227 --> 00:53:15,529
and the last one we--
completely MEChA.

1133
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:18,465
This is MEChA,
the student organization,

1134
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,300
passed the migrant tuition bill.

1135
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,269
Anybody who's worked
from three to five years

1136
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:24,505
as a migrant worker
should be considered

1137
00:53:24,571 --> 00:53:27,574
for qualifications of residency

1138
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:29,977
as a state of Wisconsin
resident,

1139
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:34,748
as a migrant tuition, which was
the precursor to the DREAM Act,

1140
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:38,652
or that is, children of the
undocumented who are qualified,

1141
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,488
the mere fact that their parents
are not documented

1142
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:44,124
if they graduate
from a bona fide high school

1143
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:48,161
and are qualified should be
admitted as residents.

1144
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:52,366
And we finally got
Governor Doyle here to pass it.

1145
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:56,270
And Voces de la Frontera leader
Christine Neumann-Ortiz

1146
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:59,706
is to the governor's right,
and I'm to the left.

1147
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:02,943
But the Republicans rescinded
the bill.

1148
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:07,247
In 2010, Governor Walker
rescinded the DREAM Act

1149
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:10,551
and also took away
the opportunity

1150
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:13,187
of undocumented to get licenses.

1151
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:16,256
So here are University
of Wisconsin students

1152
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:20,227
demanding licenses
for the undocumented

1153
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:24,031
if they are able to pass
a safe roads test,

1154
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:28,235
the stopping of the INS raids,
and tuition remission

1155
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:30,938
for children who are qualified
can come in

1156
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:33,574
and enroll in the UW system.

1157
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:38,245
And that's the end
of the road here, so...

1158
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,281
