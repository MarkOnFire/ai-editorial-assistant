26
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,834
- Hello, and welcome
to<i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

27
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,959
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,291
We're getting
a special look inside

29
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,250
the State Archive
Preservation Facility,

30
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,041
home to thousands of artifacts
from our state and beyond.

31
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:23,166
The 188,000-square-foot
state-of-the-art facility

32
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,709
is in the heart of Madison,
off the Yahara River.

33
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,875
[chipper theatrical music]

34
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:34,583
The collection, with more than
290 million objects,

35
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:38,999
feels endless and includes
artifacts large and small,

36
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,750
like films,
fine art,

37
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,250
clothes,
books,

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,291
documents,
and more.

39
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,625
The building
is owned and managed

40
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,959
by the State Department
of Administration

41
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,999
and houses collections
from multiple state agencies.

42
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,041
Each artifact
and collection

43
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,834
requires
specific environments

44
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,875
to protect and conserve them,

45
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,999
like cold storage
for film

46
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,583
or a multi-year chemical bath
to treat a dugout canoe

47
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,417
that's more than
3,000 years old.

48
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,375
We'll learn more
about the behind-the-scenes work

49
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:17,875
being done here to preserve
our past for future generations.

50
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:18,999
[shimmery music]

51
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,083
But first, we take
off to Milwaukee

52
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:21,999
to join a teen

53
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,333
whose hobby
keeps him looking up.

54
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,500

[playful guitar picking]

57
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:38,999
Nothing excites teenager
Max Gabb more than airplanes.

58
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,875
- Yeah, coming in next...

59
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,583
from La Guardia.

60
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,999
- Max is all about

61
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:51,875
tracking, identifying,
and photographing planes.

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,750
- Max: Oh, and there's
the Chicago plane.

63
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,709
Everything's coming
at once.

64
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,417
[camera shutter clicking]

65
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,875
There's a bunch of spots
around the airport to do it,

66
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,999
and anyone
can do it.

67
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:03,917
[shutter clicking]

68
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,750
- His hobby is called
"plane spotting."

69
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,291
- Max: Departures on one runway
and arrivals on the other.

70
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,709
[camera clicks]

71
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,125
All right.

72
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,667
I started doing this
during COVID

73
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,999
as a goal to bike.

74
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,166
[upbeat synthesizer]

75
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,999
Every morning, I look
on the flight radar.

76
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,208
If there's something
coming in,

77
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,625
I'll get
my camera equipment

78
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,834
and bike over
and spot it.

79
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,709
- Jamie Gabb:
He needed something
to get out of the house.

80
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:37,999
I mean,
you couldn't do much.

81
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,999
Biking was
a good thing to do.

82
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:42,375
And he's, "I'm going out
to the airport."

83
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,291
[Max pedaling]

84
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,000
[music, birds chirping]

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
- On this day, Max takes
his dad, Jamie, along...

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,875
- Dad, it's up here.

87
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,500
- To a favorite perch

88
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,250
near Milwaukee's
Mitchell International Airport.

89
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,999
- Jamie: I like this spot
a lot.

90
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,999
- Max: Yeah, it's really nice.

91
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,999
[airplane engine noise]

92
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:03,834
- Max: Ooh!

93
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,999
There's a C-130 coming in.

94
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:07,999
Wow!

95
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,750
- While the C-130
is still off in the distance,

96
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,917
Max has his sights set
on another unique aircraft.

97
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,999
- Max: This is the one
that I'm really, I'm here for.

98
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:21,542
- There's only one plane like it
in the world.

99
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,000
- Yeah, Colorado One's next.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,583
It's currently
about to cross the state line.

101
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,333
Nope, it is in Wisconsin.

102
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,750
There's a lot of planes
in the world,

103
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,667
and a lot of them are rare
for Milwaukee's airport here.

104
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,542
When the rare ones
come in,

105
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,250
that's when it's really fun
to get the planes.

106
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,875
[airplane engine,
wheels on tarmac]

107
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,125
Max: It's about to go
on final.

108
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,792
No more turns;
it's straight for the runway,

109
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,750
lined up,
and ready to land.

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,458
[camera shutter clicks]

111
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,750
It's special, painted
as the state flag of Colorado.

112
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:56,917
I really like
that one.

113
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,999
That's probably one
of the better ones they have.

114
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,000
- With Colorado One
on the ground...

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,999
- I'm gonna look at the schedule
and see...

116
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:07,375
- Max gets another hit
on a plane incoming.

117
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,999
- Max: And then, this is
a United plane that's coming in

118
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,999
to take the Orioles
back to Baltimore.

119
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,792
They are playing right now,
the Brewers are.

120
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,375
[shutter clicks twice]

121
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,834
- In just a few years...

122
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:23,208
- Max: This is a Delta A321
from Atlanta.

123
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,999
- Max has already spotted
more than a thousand aircraft.

124
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:30,291
[shutter clicking]

125
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:34,709
- The best spotting experiences
I've had

126
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,000
is probably Air Force One,

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,125
back on Labor Day when
the president came to Milwaukee.

128
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,125
Another experience,

129
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,625
there were four McDonnell
Douglas Harriers,

130
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,417
very rare.

131
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,542
They didn't do
the vertical takeoff or landing,

132
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,625
but still,
it was really awesome to see.

133
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,542
[jet engine roaring]

134
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:56,834
- To see Max so excited,
it might surprise you

135
00:05:56,834 --> 00:06:00,999
that his fascination started
from the fear of flying.

136
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,709
- I was afraid of planes,
originally.

137
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:05,625
- Jamie: There were times

138
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,999
where it was not always fun
to sit next to Max.

139
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:11,458
He just did not like
the turbulence.

140
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:16,291
So, he started to calm down
and he did his research.

141
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,750
- Max: Let's flip it.

142
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,125
Literally,
all of it opposite.

143
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,041
I kind of like
light turbulence now.

144
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,750
It gives for
an interesting ride.

145
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,834
- Good thing Max
now enjoys air travel

146
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,792
because his plane spotting
has expanded

147
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:34,417
well beyond
Wisconsin's borders.

148
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,917
[camera clicking]

149
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:40,125
- I've gone to
Fort Lauderdale, Orlando,

150
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,583
Vegas and Utah and Denver.

151
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,999
And in St. Martin,

152
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,959
the airport
with the beach,

153
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,834
where the planes are

154
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,625
a few feet
above the beach goers.

155
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,208
It looks really cool.

156
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,375
[loud engine overhead]

157
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,999
- Max also makes it easy

158
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,458
to track his aviation
adventures.

159
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:03,166
- Max: I like to edit videos
and do media for planes.

160
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,750
Post it to my Instagram
and YouTube later.

161
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,333
[airplane accelerates]

162
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,999

things about this area

432
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,875
was that people
were just so welcoming

of the idea
and of us.

434
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,208
And that gave us the confidence,
"Okay, if we can do it

435
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,875
on our home market,
well, we can do this
everywhere."

436
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,583
- Doing it everywhere,
like grocery stores

437
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,417
and specialty shops,
means scaling up,

438
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:20,917
an expansion that meant
increased production.

439
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,500
The solution?

440
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,667
Buy the candy shop

441
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,999
