- Leila Ramagopal Pertl:
Participants that come

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,652
and want to watch
one of the artists at the Mile

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,823
also have a chance to come
and get involved

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,359
in 40 to 50 hands-on events

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,096
that Mile of Music does every
year for the education portion.

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,431
Creating their own pieces
of music,

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,134
which allow them to discover

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,470
their own birthright
of music-making.

12
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,071
- Teacher:
? And the woodchuck laughed ?

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,273
? And the woodchuck chucked ?

14
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,141
? If a woodchuck
could chuck wood ?

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,511
- Melissa Freeman: The music
education team has been amazing.

16
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,246
You need to have young musicians

17
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,516
and inspire creatives,
young and old.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,887
- An education in music
means really just a community

19
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,623
coming together around joy.

20
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,227
Whether you can just hit
a drum one time,

21
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,029
that you've been a part of

22
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,565
how the soundscape
of the Mile of Music

23
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,800
has played out for that year.

24
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:10,137
And that kind of gives people
who attend the Mile

25
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,406
a little bit of a chance
to understand, like,

26
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:16,043
why music-making might be
important to the artists.

27
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,712
It's 'cause they felt
what it was like to make music

28
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,380
and make music in community.

29
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,015
- Teacher: Okay, nice job.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,585
Give yourself a huge round
of applause on that.

31
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,320
Your first song.

32
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,256
And we're 20 minutes in...
