1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,962
Sir Frederick Haldemand, 
a British Army officer 
and colonial official,

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:08,216
gave this medal to a Menominee chief
on August 17th, 1778.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,927
The chief's name was Chawanon.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,930
Haldemand presented the medal
at a general council in Montreal

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,223
with representatives of the

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:19,936
Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, Ottawa,
Potawatomi, and Chippewa.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,065
The medal is made of two silver discs
that have been bound 
with a silver rim.

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,444
One side features
a portrait of King George the Third.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,571
The text on this side reads 

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,614
George Third by the Grace of God

11
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,825
in Latin, which is part of his royal title.

12
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,954
The reverse side features the
 royal crest with a text 
of the royal motto,

13
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,957
again in Latin, God and my right.

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,795
Now this style of metal first appears
in the Americas in the summer of 1776.

15
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,008
These metals were likely intended 
as a way of gaining the favor
 of native nations,

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,386
and keeping them as allies in the war
against American colonies.
