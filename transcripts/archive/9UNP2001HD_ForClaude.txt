00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,036
[gentle music]

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,378
- Andrew Carlson: All right,
welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,982
We're so excited to have
you here watching this episode

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,050
of <i>University Place.</i>

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,854
It's my pleasure to introduce
Dr. Katrina Phillips

6
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,525
for us this evening as she
talks about treaties and tourism

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,360
in northern Wisconsin.

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,929
So Dr. Katrina Phillips
is a proud citizen

9
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,732
of the Red Cliff Band
of Lake Superior Ojibwe,

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,767
and she's an associate professor
of history

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,670
at Macalester College
in Saint Paul, Minnesota,

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:41,008
as well as a public historian
and an award-winning author.

13
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,509
And with a focus
on Native history,

14
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,011
her work has been published

15
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,812
and quoted
in all sorts of publications,

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,515
from <i>The Washington Post</i>
to NPR,

17
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,552
and she's even written
an armful of children's books.

18
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,855
And her current book project,
<i>The Land Is the Only Thing,</i>

19
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,723
focuses on
about a century's worth

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,493
of Red Cliff Ojibwe history
and activism,

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,795
environmentalism,
and the tourism

22
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,964
that shaped
northern Wisconsin.

23
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,600
So let's give a big,
warm Wisconsin welcome

24
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,769
to Dr. Katrina Phillips.

25
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,040
[audience applauding]

26
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,924
- Dr. Katrina Phillips:
Boozhoo niijiiwag.

27
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,326
Hello, my friends.

28
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,661
Niminwendam eyaawan
omaa noongom.

29
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,897
I am glad to be here today.

30
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,966
Katrina Phillips nindizhinakaaz.

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,834
My name
is Katrina Phillips.

32
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,003
Makwa nindoodem minawaa

33
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,772
Miskwaabikang
nimbiindige-bii'igaaz.

34
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,842
I am from the Bear Clan,
and I am enrolled at Red Cliff.

35
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,678
As Andrew so graciously noted,

36
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,615
I am an associate professor
in the history department

37
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,784
at Macalester College,
and I'd like to thank you all

38
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,454
for joining us
for this event tonight.

39
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,756
And I also want to take a moment

40
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,791
to thank everyone
who's come together

41
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,829
to make both this live event
and the live stream happen.

42
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,231
I grew up outside Superior

43
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,001
and spent hours
scouring the shelves

44
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,171
of the Superior Public Library
with my mom as a kid,

45
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,973
and it feels like a very
full-circle moment

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,076
to be able to simultaneously
give this talk

47
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,279
in Madison and in Superior,

48
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,216
and I'm just very grateful
for this opportunity.

49
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,286
And so, I want to begin
by situating myself,

50
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,922
literally, in this work.

51
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,960
And so as I mentioned, I grew up
in rural northern Wisconsin,

52
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,596
about half an hour southeast
of Superior.

53
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,598
Not too far
from Pattison Park,

54
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,366
if that rings a bell
for folks.

55
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,702
There we go,
I knew I'd find something.

56
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,272
And so I am the daughter
of an avid outdoorsman,

57
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,441
and those hours in the library

58
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,912
with my mom were offset by
the hours spent in duck blinds

59
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,316
and deer stands,
or standing knee-deep in rivers,

60
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,686
trying to mimic
my dad's effortless cast.

61
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,589
And so my dad's affinity
for the outdoors, though,

62
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:13,627
is matched only by his deeply
rooted belief in conservation.

63
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,329
He's a catch-and-release
fisherman.

64
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,231
It doesn't matter
how big the fish is,

65
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,266
it is going back in the river.

66
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,403
And he's also a longtime
supporter of organizations

67
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,474
that aim to help maintain and
protect wildlife and waterfowl

68
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,109
and their habitats.

69
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,078
And so, as it turned out,

70
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,214
I inherited more of his love
of history and writing

71
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,050
than his love
of hunting and fishing.

72
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,853
But I ended up marrying
a pheasant hunter

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,589
who's now dabbling
in turkey hunting.

74
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,559
He actually bought our
nine-year-old a turkey call,

75
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,861
and the nine-year-old loves to
practice it in the living room,

76
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,963
so I guess the joke's on me.

77
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,598
[audience laughing]

78
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:56,170
So I've been thinking
a lot about this lately.

79
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,907
And as a kid,
it never felt contradictory

80
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,809
to go from fishing
in the Brule River

81
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,546
to a Ducks Unlimited banquet.

82
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,813
And now, as an adult,

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,783
it doesn't feel out
of the ordinary for my husband,

84
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,419
pictured here,
to slam on the brakes

85
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,922
if he sees a rooster
in a hay field

86
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,257
on the same day
he gets another magazine

87
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,927
from Pheasants Forever
in the mail.

88
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,094
He's actually wearing

89
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,763
a Pheasants Forever hat
in this picture.

90
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,799
I promise this isn't, like,
sponsored by Pheasants Forever,

91
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,303
but it was just too good
of an image to pass up.

92
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:34,441
And so I see these two pieces
as part of a larger puzzle.

93
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,610
Neither can exist
without the other.

94
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,246
And they serve as complements
to one another.

95
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,482
If there are no pheasants
to hunt or fish to catch,

96
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,086
people's livelihoods
and hobbies disappear.

97
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,989
And so this presentation
then offers a glimpse

98
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,858
into my current research,

99
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,561
which turns to activism,
environmentalism, and tourism

100
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,630
on and around
the Red Cliff Reservation

101
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,066
in northern Wisconsin.

102
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,601
As I'm sure many of you know,

103
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,103
the region's rich forests
and plentiful lakes

104
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,973
have been a marker of pride
for decades.

105
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,441
They have served
as the foundation

106
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,409
of Native livelihoods,

107
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,446
as the backbone of multiple
economies and industries,

108
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:16,316
and as a key piece of the
state's conservation movement.

109
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,920
In this talk, I'll be tracing
the parallel growth of tourism

110
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,690
and treaty rights advocacy
in the 20th and 21st centuries,

111
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,859
highlighting the questions,
contestations,

112
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,795
and outcomes of these movements.

113
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,465
So the reservation
of the Red Cliff Band

114
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,535
of Lake Superior Ojibwe,
which is my reservation,

115
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,803
sits in the northernmost part
of Wisconsin

116
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,705
along the south shore
of Gichigami,

117
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,909
or what we as Ojibwe people
call Lake Superior.

118
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,744
Our reservation
is one of several

119
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,379
that were established
in the state

120
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,814
through the 1854 Treaty
of La Pointe.

121
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,151
Like Native nations across
what's now the United States,

122
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,054
Ojibwe people have advocated
for their lands,

123
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:58,959
their livelihoods, and
their sovereignty for centuries.

124
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,961
For my purposes here today,

125
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,464
I'm going to start in the early
decades of the 19th century.

126
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,067
I am a historian;
you were all warned about this,

127
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:11,371
okay, so don't say
you didn't see this coming.

128
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,274
So in the summer of 1837,

129
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,244
more than a thousand
Ojibwe people traveled

130
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,946
to Fort Snelling,

131
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,014
a military outpost built
at the confluence

132
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,851
of the Minnesota
and Mississippi rivers.

133
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,552
They came from across the lands

134
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,255
that would become
Minnesota and Wisconsin

135
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,157
because government officials,

136
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,193
including Wisconsin Territorial
Governor Henry Dodge,

137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,062
wanted Ojibwe lands,

138
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,366
especially the vast pine forests
on 13 million acres

139
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,201
in what's now
east-central Minnesota

140
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,036
and northern Wisconsin.

141
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,339
He told the Ojibwe
who had gathered at the fort

142
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,275
that these lands were
not worth much for agriculture

143
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,878
or for settlement
or for hunting.

144
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,513
The forests, he claimed,

145
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,049
were the focus
of the negotiations.

146
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,352
During the treaty negotiations,
though,

147
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,687
Ojibwe leaders insisted

148
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,690
that the treaty include
an explicit retention

149
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,195
of their rights to hunt, fish,
and gather on the ceded lands.

150
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,297
As a leader named
Eshkibagikoonzhe,

151
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,168
also known to French fur traders
as Flat Mouth, told Dodge,

152
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,704
"You know that without the land
and the rivers and lakes,

153
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,573
we could not live."

154
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,178
Eshkibagikoonzhe reminded
the treaty negotiators

155
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,714
that the Ojibwe wanted to
preserve their right of, quote,

156
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,283
"Making sugar from the trees

157
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,752
and getting a living
from the lakes and rivers."

158
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,420
End quote.

159
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,023
Article five
of the Treaty of Saint Peter's,

160
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,058
also known
as the Pine Tree Treaty,

161
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,862
guaranteed that the Ojibwe had
the privilege of, quote,

162
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,966
"hunting, fishing, and gathering
the wild rice upon the lands,

163
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,434
"the rivers, and the lakes

164
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,737
included in
the territory ceded."

165
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,707
Five years later,

166
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:57,377
Ojibwe leaders ceded
an additional 10 million acres,

167
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,612
including what would
eventually become

168
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,814
the Red Cliff Reservation.

169
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:05,853
This time, though, treaty
negotiators did not want timber.

170
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,522
The discovery of minerals
in northern Michigan

171
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,625
drove this round
of treaty negotiations.

172
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,661
And so Ojibwe representatives
traveled to La Pointe

173
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:19,666
on Madeline Island
in the summer and fall of 1842.

174
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,569
Here, as in the
previous negotiations,

175
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,838
the Ojibwe negotiators
were adamant

176
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,875
that they would reserve
their use of fructuary rights.

177
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,978
Colloquially known
as the Copper Treaty,

178
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,380
article two
of the Treaty of La Pointe

179
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:37,050
echoed the Treaty
of St. Peter's in recognizing

180
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,486
that Ojibwe people reserved,
quote,

181
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,822
"the right of hunting
on the ceded territory."

182
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,423
End quote.

183
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,461
A subsequent Treaty
of La Pointe, signed in 1854,

184
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,496
in the wake of what
we as Ojibwe people

185
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,532
call the Sandy Lake Tragedy,

186
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,435
created a number of reservations
across the upper Great Lakes,

187
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,238
and as they had done
for decades,

188
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,608
the Ojibwe insisted on retaining
the right to hunt,

189
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:05,012
fish, and gather
on the ceded lands.

190
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:09,216
The foresight of our ancestors
kept Ojibwe people alive

191
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,418
throughout the rest
of the century.

192
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,187
Ojibwe people hunted, fished,

193
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,756
and gathered to provide
for their communities,

194
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,792
and they continually recognized
and understood

195
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,562
the importance
of these three treaties.

196
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,932
The treaties, meanwhile,
cleared the path for speculators

197
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,535
and the development of
resource extraction industries.

198
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,137
Settlers followed speculators,

199
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:33,874
and Wisconsin became
a state in 1848.

200
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:37,711
As fellow Red Cliff Ojibwe
historian Michael Witgen argues,

201
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,880
the lands that had seemed,
quote,

202
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,916
"unfavorable for U.S.
settlements," end quote,

203
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:48,622
had transformed into hospitable
places for resource extraction.

204
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:54,194
And so this photo here, this is
the Bayfield Wharf in 1936.

205
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,830
And so the lands and
the lakes of northern Wisconsin

206
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:00,868
were an early target for these
resource extraction industries.

207
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,703
Even the lake itself
was not immune

208
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,205
from the siren song
of extraction,

209
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,808
and Chantal Norrgard's work
reminds us

210
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,376
that the Great Lakes
fishing industry

211
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,912
was one of the
earliest endeavors.

212
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,114
The American Fur Company
started the first

213
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,483
commercial fishing venture
in the 1830s,

214
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,752
and, again, this is before
the treaty cessions

215
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,487
of 1837 and 1842,

216
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,990
and it would be one
of the region's

217
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,426
most dominant industries
for more than a century.

218
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,997
The 1855 opening of the canal
at Sault Ste. Marie

219
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,865
allowed for the export
of whitefish,

220
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,301
and the expansion
of fishing operations

221
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,370
in the 1870s and 1880s

222
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,506
led the <i>Bayfield County Press</i>
to proclaim that,

223
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,809
quote, "The fishing industry
has given a name and fame

224
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,279
to Bayfield
all over the United States."

225
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,947
End quote.

226
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,516
I can neither confirm nor deny
that that was actually the case,

227
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,252
but it's a good quote, right?

228
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:57,391
The overfishing of whitefish
in the 1890s forced fishermen

229
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,826
to switch to lake trout
and herring,

230
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,862
but the whitefish
population rebounded

231
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,398
by the early 20th century.

232
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,934
Commercial fishing
may have been

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,270
the first resource extraction
industry in the region,

234
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,474
but it operated alongside
logging, quarrying, and tourism.

235
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,578
And so the cession
of those vast timber holdings

236
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,514
opened the floodgates
of the logging industry,

237
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:25,052
and the first logging boom ran
from 1850 to 1856.

238
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,221
According to Jerry Apps,

239
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,823
lumber was the driving factor
in the development

240
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,892
of central
and northern Wisconsin.

241
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,560
Towns around Red Cliff,

242
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:37,831
including Bayfield, Ashland,
and Washburn, all followed suit.

243
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,334
The American Fur Company built
the first sawmill

244
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,137
in the Chequamegon region,
just south of Bayfield in 1845.

245
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,207
So this is just three years
after the Treaty of La Pointe

246
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,610
that was signed in 1842.

247
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,412
Other sawmills sprang up
throughout the region,

248
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,781
and, according to Jane C. Bush,

249
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,751
seven sawmills spread
across Ashland, Washburn,

250
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:02,022
and Bayfield logged more than
67 million board feet of lumber

251
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,757
in 1885 alone.

252
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:08,462
And in 1892, sawmills in
Bayfield and Ashland counties

253
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,999
cut more
than 285 million board feet.

254
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,870
So we have the development
of these industries

255
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,772
throughout the 19th century.

256
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,607
And again,
as promised in the title,

257
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,676
there's another one
I want to turn to as well.

258
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,578
Tourism.

259
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,880
So tourism was
a flourishing industry

260
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,917
in the eastern United States
by the 1820s,

261
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,220
emerging at a pivotal moment
in U.S. society

262
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,523
when Americans were working to
define their national identity

263
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,992
in opposition to Europe.

264
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,894
In Wisconsin and elsewhere,

265
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,830
the tourist industry
initially sought to capitalize

266
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,401
on America's fascination
with the nation's landscape

267
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,470
and its original inhabitants.

268
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,539
Kilbourn City
in south-central Wisconsin

269
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,509
eventually renamed itself
Wisconsin Dells

270
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,744
to capitalize
on the popularity

271
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,514
of the Dells
on the Wisconsin River.

272
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,750
The Dells were known as the
region's greatest natural wonder

273
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,086
as early as the mid-1840s

274
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,821
and quickly became
one of the state's

275
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,691
first tourist destinations.

276
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:15,395
By 1849, when Wisconsin
naturalists toured the region,

277
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,032
the area already boasted
an exciting history

278
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,601
to draw tourists in,

279
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,938
a hotel, and residents
eager to entertain visitors.

280
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,908
While, you know,
these somewhat dry,

281
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,743
geologically-centered
descriptions

282
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,446
of the many fantastic shapes
in the cliffs

283
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,515
may not have been
thrilling entries

284
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,483
in a tourist's guidebook,

285
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,151
the early fascination
with the area

286
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,688
soon turned
into a booming business.

287
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:46,193
These early tourist manuals
and promotional materials

288
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,662
emphasized the area's
natural landscape

289
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,364
and natural beauty.

290
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,066
Lakes and rivers
held bountiful fish to catch,

291
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,236
and the woods hid
game animals for hunting.

292
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:59,273
Those not inclined
toward hunting and fishing

293
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,175
could tour breathtaking sites

294
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,077
whose innate splendor
had clearly been preserved.

295
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,014
Tourists started inching
into what's now the Midwest

296
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,649
and the Great Lakes region

297
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,484
by the middle
of the 19th century.

298
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,219
By the late 1860s,

299
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:17,157
lakes in southern Wisconsin
were fashionable vacation spots,

300
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,060
attracting tourists
from Milwaukee, Chicago,

301
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,930
Memphis, and even New Orleans.

302
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,498
By the 1870s,

303
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,301
railroad companies
and local entrepreneurs

304
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,939
led concerted efforts to attract
tourists to Wisconsin.

305
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:36,577
An 1875 "Tourist's Guide
to the Wisconsin Dells"

306
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,013
embraced what they called
the "prose, romance, and poetry

307
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,115
of this wonderful region,"

308
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,384
teasing the general public
with stories

309
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,653
of the natural wonders
and beauties

310
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,655
of the scenery surrounding it,

311
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,726
and more especially, the notable
Dells of the Wisconsin River

312
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,462
and the strange, wild glens
and canyons

313
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,199
which enter the Dells
from either side.

314
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,504
Encouraged by the early success
at the Dells,

315
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,639
business owners
and entrepreneurs

316
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:09,276
quickly began building cabins,
cottages, and resorts,

317
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,579
and contracting with railroad
and steamship companies.

318
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,847
Soon after,

319
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,850
wealthy urban tourists began
traveling to Wisconsin

320
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,319
to avail themselves
of the numerous opportunities

321
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,990
for outdoor recreation
and relaxation.

322
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,193
Newspaper writers swooned
over the clean air,

323
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,995
breathtaking sunsets,

324
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,364
and wondrous meetings
of soaring red bluffs

325
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,136
and deep blue water that held
even more allure for visitors.

326
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:39,773
Another 1875 "Guide
to Summer Resorts in Wisconsin,

327
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,375
Minnesota, and Michigan,"

328
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,277
which was published
as a supplement

329
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,046
to a railroad routes
and rates book,

330
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,716
listed more than a dozen
Wisconsin destinations.

331
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,585
The guide, for instance,

332
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,922
extolled sailing, rowing,
and fishing near Milwaukee,

333
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,924
which also had
the full benefit

334
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,726
of the cool and refreshing
lake breeze.

335
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,162
The water cure
at the Bidwell House

336
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,630
promised to offer speedy

337
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,133
and permanent relief
for diseases

338
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,836
that had, quote,
"baffled the skill of man

339
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,104
and have been
pronounced incurable."

340
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,840
End quote.

341
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,042
But tourists came to Wisconsin

342
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,145
for more than just
the promised health benefits.

343
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:22,316
In 1880, Chicago attorney
John Lyle King boasted

344
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:26,086
that the northern wildernesses
offered a grateful reprieve

345
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:30,390
and a speedy reparation from
what he called, oh, God,

346
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:34,161
the, quote, "exhaustion that
comes of the inordinate

347
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:37,231
"and exacting frets
and activities of business,

348
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,933
"the languor and inertia
of summer fervors,

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,535
"the ennui and satiety

350
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:43,804
that followed the dissipations
of social life."

351
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,506
End quote.

352
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,675
We get it, right?
[audience laughing]

353
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:52,012
But Chicago lawyers
and capitalists like King

354
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,548
and his companions
had come to Wisconsin

355
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,316
for outdoor adventures

356
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,652
that freed them
from the restraints and stress

357
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,554
of the city and civilization,

358
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,390
proferring instead the
imagined freedom and simplicity

359
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,359
of a rural paradise.

360
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,496
In many instances,

361
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,199
the Native people who
still lived throughout Wisconsin

362
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,202
became part
of the tourist experience.

363
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:20,541
King's sojourn was only possible
because of two Menominee guides.

364
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:24,545
And so in his narrative, King
calls them natural foresters.

365
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,680
He calls them
skilled canoeists.

366
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,249
He calls them
men with acute senses,

367
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:32,920
whom he deems, quote,
"the navigator of the birchbark,

368
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,755
"the carrier of the luggage,

369
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,257
"the tent builder,
the log heap fireman,

370
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,693
"the cook,
the baker, the scullion,

371
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,628
"in fact, the indispensable

372
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,564
general utility man
and brother."

373
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,299
End quote.

374
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,235
Aren't you glad I read this and
you didn't have to read that?

375
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,736
[audience laughing]

376
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:54,474
At other times, Native people
were the draw for tourists.

377
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,545
An 1897 bicycling guide
encouraged cyclists

378
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:01,648
to visit what they called
the Chippewa Indian Reservation

379
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,585
in Odanah in the northern part
of the state,

380
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:08,155
calling it, quote,
"an enjoyable trip for wheelmen

381
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:11,124
who desire to see
the red man at home."

382
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,926
End quote.

383
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:15,462
And I'd be remiss
if I didn't mention

384
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,332
the Stand Rock Indian Ceremonial
pictured here,

385
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,735
which capitalized both
on the touristic desire

386
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,904
to see both Native performers

387
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:28,475
and the increasing popularity
of the Wisconsin Dells.

388
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,345
So railroads,
hotels, and resorts

389
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,882
started making arrangements for
and promoting performances

390
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,783
that featured
Native participants

391
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,354
in order to offer their guests
the wilderness experiences

392
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,789
that urban tourists craved.

393
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,224
In one of the most...

394
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,194
I should probably call it
infamous example,

395
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,296
Indian agent William Mercer

396
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,632
and William F.
"Buffalo Bill" Cody--

397
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,735
yes, the man, the myth,
the legend himself--

398
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,204
brought Bad River Ojibwe leaders
together

399
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:02,743
with Cody's Lakota performers
for a publicity stunt in 1896.

400
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,745
Mercer and Cody believed

401
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,714
that a dramatic signing
of a peace treaty

402
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:10,918
on the grounds of Ashland's
grand Hotel Chequamegon

403
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,920
would thrill and delight
non-Natives

404
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,155
in the surrounding region.

405
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,559
Nearly 900 Bad River
and Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe

406
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,328
came to Ashland for this event.

407
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,764
And according to Eric Olmanson,

408
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,934
the sheer number
of Ojibwe people at the hotel

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,903
also became something
of a tourist attraction,

410
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,372
because then hundreds
of Ashland residents

411
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,775
went down to Front Street

412
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:39,179
to see what was called, quote,
"the dusky men and women

413
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,248
"whose presence had converted
the Chequamegon

414
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,383
into a veritable
Indian reserve."

415
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,285
End quote.

416
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,120
Not to mention the fact
that Red Cliff

417
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,557
and Bad River are still
pretty close here, right?

418
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:54,695
But again, this is
what we're dealing with here.

419
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,066
So for most
of the 19th century, though,

420
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,367
tourism in Wisconsin

421
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:03,537
was a parallel industry,
operating alongside,

422
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,439
again, fishing,
logging, and quarrying,

423
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:06,874
among other industries,

424
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,543
especially in the northern part
of the state.

425
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,112
As the 19th century barreled
toward the 20th

426
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,948
and extractive
resource industries declined,

427
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:17,351
the state needed to find
a new direction

428
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,053
toward economic prosperity.

429
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,456
An infrastructure for tourism
already existed

430
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,291
throughout most of the state

431
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,860
thanks to the proliferation
of railroad lines

432
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:31,765
that crisscrossed the state, and
the growing automobile industry.

433
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:34,368
Abandoning these pathways
was not an option

434
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:39,273
after all of the time and money
spent building railway lines,

435
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,443
locks and docks
for steamships, and roads.

436
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,514
So rather than exporting
resources out of the state,

437
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,751
tourism aimed to import people,

438
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:54,054
primarily people from
larger cities such as Chicago,

439
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,790
Milwaukee, Minneapolis,
and Saint Paul,

440
00:20:56,857 --> 00:21:00,260
and even from cities
as far south as St. Louis

441
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,362
who hoped to escape, quote,

442
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,199
"the noise, congestion,
and pace of urban life."

443
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,934
End quote.

444
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,070
In an effort to appeal
to more potential visitors,

445
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:13,006
the state promoted palliative
cures for city living,

446
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:17,444
such as the Wisconsin Dells,
and the restorative resorts

447
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,713
that capitalized
on painting their land,

448
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,915
water, and air as pristine,

449
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,685
while outdoor recreation
endeavors offered tourists

450
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,689
the chance to fish,
swim, dive, surf, trap shoot,

451
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,457
play golf, play tennis,

452
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:35,062
and take motorboat trips
and automobile excursions.

453
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,597
So I'm gonna take
a moment here,

454
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,498
because every time
I use this picture,

455
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,469
I like to point out
the lady dressed in all black

456
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:45,539
because she really seems
like she's enjoying herself.

457
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,708
[audience laughing]

458
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,777
This is an image
of a picnic on Basswood Island,

459
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:54,181
up in the Apostle Islands,
from 1916.

460
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:57,351
But tourism started
to take a stronger foothold

461
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,685
in the region, again,

462
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,256
as these extractive resource
industries start to decline.

463
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,058
And so the tourism industry
starts marketing

464
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,294
the state's lakes, rivers,
and forests

465
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,396
to a traveling American public

466
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,365
that had both become
disillusioned

467
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,033
with the urban environment

468
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,104
and had the time
and the money to travel.

469
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,940
So as large cities become
more and more crowded,

470
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,476
the country life
comes to be more appealing

471
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,344
to urban dwellers.

472
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:27,114
City folks hopped in their cars,
boarded a steamship,

473
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,550
or bought a train ticket
to a destination

474
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,418
that promised fresh air

475
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,888
and a respite from the
daily toils of city life.

476
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,657
Increasing numbers of city folks

477
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,992
throughout the
industrialized United States

478
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,662
fled what Michael McNally
calls their, quote,

479
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:44,831
"bureaucratized lives
in steamy, hot cities

480
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,334
"for the northern edges
of civilization,

481
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,636
"where they hoped
to brush up against something

482
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,438
refreshing and authentic."

483
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,273
End quote.

484
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,176
But early 20th century tourists
also brushed up

485
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:59,379
against something
they might not have anticipated,

486
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:03,917
and that would be Native people
exercising their treaty rights.

487
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:06,954
In fact,
state conservation officers

488
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,455
had been arresting Ojibwe people

489
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:10,524
and other Native people
throughout the state

490
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,260
for hunting and fishing
on and off the reservations

491
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,196
well before the end
of the 19th century.

492
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,632
A Lac Courte Oreilles leader
known as Joe White

493
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,869
was shot and killed
by a game warden in 1894

494
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:24,671
for hunting deer
out of season.

495
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,874
Two elderly men
from Lac du Flambeau

496
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,042
were arrested in 1897

497
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,678
and charged with being
in possession of venison

498
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,747
off the reservation.

499
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,416
And a man named John Blackbird
was arrested

500
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,585
and convicted in 1901

501
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:42,289
for setting fishnets
on the Bad River Reservation.

502
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:43,657
A few years later,

503
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,326
an Ojibwe man named
Michael Morrin was arrested

504
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,630
for using gill nets
to fish in Lake Superior.

505
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:52,399
Morrin argued that his right
to fish in Lake Superior

506
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:55,402
was protected
by the Treaty of 1854,

507
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:58,839
but the Wisconsin Supreme Court
ruled in 1908

508
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:03,510
that Wisconsin statehood
had abrogated treaty rights.

509
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,579
And so I want to pause here
for a moment,

510
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:08,015
because it probably feels like
I'm telling a couple parallel

511
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:11,752
or even unrelated stories:
a story about tourism,

512
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,820
a story about industry
and the economy,

513
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:16,790
and a story about treaties
and treaty rights.

514
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,458
But I find
that these connections,

515
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,460
both among
and across these stories,

516
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,297
is exactly what makes
this history so fascinating,

517
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,233
especially as we keep moving
through the 20th century

518
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,003
and as these contestations
continue to occur.

519
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,472
Because the treaties
that Native people signed

520
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,074
in what is now the state
of Wisconsin

521
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,609
and across the country

522
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:39,079
are considered the supreme law
of the land.

523
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,481
Our ancestors could not
have foreseen the development

524
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,350
of a tourism industry,

525
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,586
but they recognized
the importance of protecting

526
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,356
the right to hunt and fish
in the ceded territories.

527
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:51,191
So Ojibwe people
across the state

528
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:53,594
continued exercising
their treaty rights,

529
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,297
and they started asserting
their status as tribal citizens

530
00:24:57,364 --> 00:25:00,667
and therefore not subject
to state law on reservations

531
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:04,738
as early as the 1920s,
which is phenomenal.

532
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,875
Lac du Flambeau attorney
Thomas St. Germain,

533
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,643
who was the first Native lawyer

534
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,678
admitted to the bar
in the state of Wisconsin,

535
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:17,684
was arguing for treaty rights
in court as early as the 1930s.

536
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,888
Once again, we have parallel
developments happening here.

537
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:23,590
We have the ongoing developments
of the tourism industry

538
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,293
on one hand,
and we have Native people

539
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,429
across the state arguing for
their treaty-guaranteed rights

540
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:32,032
to hunt and fish on the other.

541
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,202
And so as part of, you know,
these kind of,

542
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:39,540
these mixing of these industries
and of Native sovereignty,

543
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,441
you have boosters,
for instance,

544
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:44,044
who start pushing for the
creation of a national park

545
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:47,714
in the Apostle Islands
in the 1920s.

546
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,350
But the National Park Service
investigator

547
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,086
who comes out
refused to endorse it,

548
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:56,390
because in that moment,
all he saw were the scars

549
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:59,593
in the wake
of decades of logging.

550
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:03,730
But interest
in conservation and tourism

551
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:05,766
in northern Wisconsin
keeps rising

552
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,634
after World War II.

553
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,572
A postwar tourism boom filled
state parks and campgrounds

554
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,241
to the brim, and beaches
and hiking trails

555
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,143
were increasingly popular.

556
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,611
And as you can see here,

557
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:23,383
visits to national parks jumped
86% between 1950 and 1960,

558
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,121
and visits to recreational areas
jumped 143%.

559
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:30,157
Attendance
at Wisconsin state parks

560
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,793
grew 250% from 1927 to 1954.

561
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,331
The number
of state park visitors

562
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:40,067
swelled from 750,000 in 1944

563
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,470
to more than 5 million
in 1956.

564
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:45,806
And in this moment,

565
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,909
Congress calls the
added pressure on state parks,

566
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:51,211
campgrounds,
and recreational areas

567
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,515
a crisis in outdoor recreation.

568
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:56,049
James Feldman contends

569
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,720
that Wisconsin's recreation
crisis was especially acute

570
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,488
because there were
a lot of people

571
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:03,824
who believed Wisconsin
didn't even have enough

572
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:06,326
public recreational lands
and facilities

573
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:09,963
before this tourism boom
in the 1950s.

574
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:14,735
So some folks turned
to one of the state's gems,

575
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:19,072
the Apostle Islands,
to try and solve this problem.

576
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,009
Supporters, like Wisconsin's
governor turned senator

577
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,177
Gaylord Nelson.

578
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,179
I don't think you can do
a talk in Wisconsin

579
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:26,780
if you don't
at least mention Gaylord Nelson.

580
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,615
So there you go.

581
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:31,084
And so people
like Nelson believed

582
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,556
that a national lakeshore in the
region would increase tourism

583
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:39,693
and boost the economy through
the protection and enhancement

584
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,962
of the existing environment

585
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,498
for recreational
and aesthetic purposes

586
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:46,266
rather than the protection
of natural areas

587
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,335
in a pristine condition.

588
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:52,339
So the key thing here is that
they're not advocating for,

589
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:55,075
necessarily, preservation,
right?

590
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:57,277
They don't want to leave it
exactly the way it is.

591
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:02,249
They're turning towards
conservation and recreation.

592
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:05,118
So the conditions
of a lakeshore,

593
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,521
though, also had the potential

594
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:10,357
to affect
both Ojibwe livelihoods

595
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:12,626
and the lands
that provided food

596
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,094
for those who hunted
and fished

597
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:16,563
to support
their families and communities.

598
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,601
And so here, again, using the
Apostle Islands as an example,

599
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:24,104
tourism was intended to use
and consume nature

600
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:27,674
without the destructive forces
of resource extraction.

601
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:30,844
And so outdoor recreation
becomes a critical piece

602
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:34,882
of Wisconsin's mid-20th century
tourism industry.

603
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:38,252
And by the 1960s,
as Chantal Norrgard argues,

604
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,921
in the interests
of promoting tourism,

605
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:44,358
state governments focused
on restoring the environment

606
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:48,996
and implementing conservation
laws that favored recreation

607
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,733
and discouraged commercial
or subsistence land use.

608
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,235
All right,
so that's the big key here

609
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:59,006
because this is a huge shift
from the previous economic focus

610
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,409
on logging, quarrying,
and commercial fishing.

611
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:05,612
And it's a really important
moment in Wisconsin history

612
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,481
because we have all
of these movements, right?

613
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,616
We have tourism, treaty rights,

614
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,919
conservation,
and economic interests

615
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:15,222
coming together simultaneously.

616
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:19,226
But there's another crisis
in the state as well.

617
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,827
And so commercial fishing,
again,

618
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:23,096
that bastion
of regional industry

619
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:27,367
reached what Jane Bush calls
its golden years in the 1940s,

620
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,103
generating half a million
dollars in revenue

621
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,839
in 1946 alone.

622
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,675
The industry collapsed
in the 1950s

623
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:38,178
as sea lamprey targeted
whitefish and lake trout,

624
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:42,249
and the last regional
fish dealer closed down in 1958.

625
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,751
The demise
of commercial fishing

626
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:47,721
parallels the rise
of regional tourism,

627
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,357
and tourism also relied
heavily on the sportsmen

628
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,559
who came north to fish.

629
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:57,931
State attempts to protect
fish populations for sportsmen,

630
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:01,835
though, often painted
both commercial fishing

631
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:05,239
and Ojibwe treaty fishing
as a threat to the environment

632
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,975
and the fish populations.

633
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,644
And so the questions
that swirled around tourism,

634
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:14,648
treaty rights, and industry
were connected to land use,

635
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:16,817
land preservation
and conservation,

636
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,920
and the protection
of natural resources.

637
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:23,457
Because if tourists were
to come north to hunt and fish,

638
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,559
what would happen
if there weren't

639
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:28,695
any animals in the woods
or fish in the lakes and rivers?

640
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:30,197
Where would tourists go?

641
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,798
What would tourists do?

642
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:35,235
Would they even have a reason to
come north in the first place?

643
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:38,739
And so for Native people
in northern Wisconsin,

644
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:42,242
these questions
around tourism and conservation

645
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,245
are colliding
with both federal Indian policy

646
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:48,849
and their
treaty-guaranteed rights.

647
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,584
So in the 1960s,

648
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:54,821
northern Wisconsin essentially
becomes a battleground

649
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,723
for local residents,

650
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,626
wilderness advocates,
state and federal officials,

651
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,863
tourism proponents,
and Native nations,

652
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,333
as Nelson, who, again,
every Wisconsinite knows

653
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,935
as the founder of Earth Day,

654
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,636
aimed to turn
the Apostle Islands

655
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,738
into a national
recreation area

656
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:13,574
in order to both protect
the environment

657
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,543
and diversify
the tourism economy.

658
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,412
What's key here, though,

659
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:21,682
is that proponents wanted
to draw tourists to the area

660
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:23,784
by designating
the Apostle Islands

661
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:25,586
as a recreational area, right,

662
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:28,755
not as a national park
or a wilderness area

663
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:31,225
because outdoor recreation
is seen as a way

664
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,061
to boost
Wisconsin's economy.

665
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:35,562
For Ojibwe people, though,

666
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,764
the development
of a national lakeshore

667
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:40,133
had the potential to threaten
their use of the land

668
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,970
and undermine their
treaty-guaranteed rights.

669
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:46,773
As early as 1962,
<i>The Milwaukee Journal</i> noted

670
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,809
that the lakeshore proposal was,
quote,

671
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:52,813
"bound to raised mixed feelings
in one familiar with the place."

672
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,381
End quote.

673
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,416
Those mixed feelings,
which, let's be real,

674
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:58,452
that's about as good
of a Wisconsin euphemism

675
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,420
as you're ever gonna get,

676
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:03,857
led to years
of plans and protests,

677
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,593
congressional hearings,
newspaper editorials,

678
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,364
and even parade floats
at the Bayfield Applefest.

679
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,633
The lakeshore debates came
at a critical juncture

680
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:14,468
in state tourism initiatives,

681
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:17,337
mounting concerns
about environmental degradation

682
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:20,908
and the rise of Native activism
and advocacy movements,

683
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,543
because you have
conservationists who,

684
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,411
on one hand, are rallying to,

685
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:27,014
quote, unquote,
"save the Apostle Islands,"

686
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,782
and you have tourism advocates

687
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:31,385
who are pointing to the
economic potential

688
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,055
of a national recreation area
in the northern Wisconsin.

689
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,591
There was a study
by a Wisconsin economist

690
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:40,661
that said over 900,000
annual visitors would spend

691
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:43,630
$7 million a year in the region.

692
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,233
But a project of this size,
though,

693
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,135
couldn't just happen overnight.

694
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,571
Congressional hearings
on this proposed lakeshore

695
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,306
started in 1967,

696
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,808
and this was the first of what
would be

697
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,476
four total hearings
on the lakeshore.

698
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:57,945
And as you can see here,

699
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:00,714
the first was held in Ashland
in 1967.

700
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:04,051
The second was in D.C.
in March of 1969.

701
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:07,788
The third came back to Ashland
in August of 1969.

702
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,389
And the fourth
and final was in D.C.

703
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,458
in the spring of 1970.

704
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:14,895
The first hearing in Ashland
drew politicians,

705
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:17,764
professors, newspapermen,
summer residents,

706
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,900
non-Native homeowners,
attorneys,

707
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,134
the presidents of

708
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,036
the Minnesota-Wisconsin
Fisheries Association--

709
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:24,705
yes, that was a thing--

710
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,307
famed naturalist author
Sigurd Olson,

711
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:30,978
and Ojibwe people
from Bad River and Red Cliff.

712
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:33,580
The Wilderness Society
urged conservationists

713
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:36,750
to attend the hearings or voice
their support through letters

714
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:38,352
to government representatives,

715
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,287
calling it, quote,
"one of the most unique

716
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,155
"and valuable units

717
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,124
in the National Wilderness
Preservation System."

718
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,859
End quote.

719
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,595
And so I first learned about the
contestations over the lakeshore

720
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:50,397
when I was in graduate school.

721
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,299
I have some friends here
from grad school

722
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,401
who are now professors
at the University of Wisconsin,

723
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:55,802
who have heard me
talk about this

724
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,204
probably ad nauseam
by this point,

725
00:33:57,271 --> 00:34:00,874
so I apologize,
but it fits pretty well here.

726
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:04,578
And so my mom's brother
had sent me some photocopies

727
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:07,147
of newspaper articles
from the 1960s,

728
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:08,882
and there were a couple pages

729
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,118
of congressional testimony
in there too.

730
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:12,519
And so my grandma,

731
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,588
Margaret Newago-Pascale,
was mentioned in the articles,

732
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:17,024
and she was quoted
in the testimony as well.

733
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,426
And I eventually figured out
that the testimony

734
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:23,864
my uncle sent me came from the
March 1969 hearing,

735
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:27,067
where my grandma and the tribal
chairman had flown to D.C.

736
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:31,238
to speak out against
the proposal for the lakeshore.

737
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:33,207
And so, there she is.

738
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,275
She's right there in the middle.

739
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,510
That's my grandma.

740
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,478
And so as I pored over

741
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:41,315
the thousand-plus
pages of testimony--

742
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:43,183
in case you're wondering
what historians do for fun

743
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,053
in the summer, that's not it--

744
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:51,158
a few names caught my eye
from the 1967 hearing.

745
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:54,428
Mrs. Walter Newago
and Caroline Newago.

746
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,363
And so they shared
my grandma's maiden name,

747
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,599
which is somewhat common
at Red Cliff,

748
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:01,602
but I didn't know
who they were.

749
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:04,605
And so as I always do when
I find a Newago in the archives,

750
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,939
I called my mom.

751
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,308
And she goes, "Oh, that's Sis."

752
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:11,278
And I was, as you might expect,
not exactly following.

753
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:12,946
It was a name I recognized,

754
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:15,682
but I had no idea where
my mom was going with this.

755
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:18,385
And so,
as my mother explained, Sis,

756
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,153
whose given name was Myrtle,

757
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,489
had married my grandma's
brother, Sammy.

758
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:23,857
And so I remembered, you know,

759
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:26,460
hearing stories
about Sammy and Sis.

760
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,662
But who the hell was Walter?

761
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,197
"Oh," my mom said,

762
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,499
"his given name
was Walter Samuel,

763
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:35,002
but everybody
called him Sammy."

764
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:36,503
Fair enough, that was one.

765
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,305
All right, I had one down.

766
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:41,275
And my mom couldn't quite
figure out who Caroline was,

767
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,010
so she said she'd call
her sister,

768
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,312
she'd call my Aunt Janet,
and get back to me.

769
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:48,515
And so I got a call from my mom
a few days later, and she goes,

770
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:51,018
"I cannot believe
I didn't think of this.

771
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,321
"But when I asked Janet
who Caroline Newago was,

772
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:58,358
Janet said, 'Karen,
that's Aunt Carrie.'"

773
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,894
And so Carrie had married
my grandma's brother, Vincent.

774
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,064
So Sis and Carrie were
my grandma's sisters-in-law.

775
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:05,666
And I could hear my mom,
you know,

776
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:07,568
kind of trying
to contain her excitement

777
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:11,205
as she asked if there were any
other names she might recognize.

778
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,473
So I went, you know,
through the table of contents,

779
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,409
looking for more
Red Cliff folks,

780
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:18,712
and I found Idile Duffy listed
in the names of people

781
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:21,448
who offered testimony in 1967.

782
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:25,319
And so that was Sis's sister,
my mom said.

783
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:27,921
And so I called her back
a few days later.

784
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:29,756
By now, you are all feeling
sorry for her.

785
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:32,226
I'm well aware of that, okay?

786
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:36,763
And I asked her if she had
any idea why my grandma,

787
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,401
why Sis and Carrie and Idile
would have gone to Ashland

788
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:44,671
or flown to D.C.
to give their testimony.

789
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,273
And she thought about it
for a minute,

790
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,943
and then she said, "These were
the women who would do that.

791
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,681
This is what they had to do,
so they went and did it."

792
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,317
And I've thought about
that conversation with my mom

793
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:00,587
countless times over the years
as I'm doing this research,

794
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:03,524
because all four
of these women have walked on,

795
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,994
but their testimony lives on
as a powerful reminder

796
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,130
of their role as advocates
for our people.

797
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:11,732
And as an Ojibwe woman,

798
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:13,834
and as someone
who studies Native histories,

799
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,170
I think a lot about
what I've come to consider as,

800
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:19,640
you know, kind of quiet activism
or the many ways

801
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:22,009
in which people advocate
for themselves,

802
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,278
their communities,
their resources, their lands,

803
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,848
their languages,
and their cultures.

804
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,484
So two years later, in 1969,

805
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,687
my grandma and the
tribal chairman at the time,

806
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,024
Philip Gordon,
flew to Washington, D.C.,

807
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,992
to testify
in the second hearing.

808
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:41,361
And my grandma also spoke
at the third hearing

809
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,530
in Ashland later that year.

810
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,400
While her time at the mic
was shorter than it was in D.C.,

811
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:49,403
her words still live on
in that transcript.

812
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,738
"The land,"
she told the committee,

813
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:57,144
"is the only thing we can
associate our heritage with."

814
00:37:57,211 --> 00:38:00,914
So I love this quote, and not
just because my grandma said it.

815
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,116
That's part of it,
but not the whole thing.

816
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:07,020
Because as a historian,
I see it as a beautiful reminder

817
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:10,357
of the historic,
the contemporary,

818
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,192
and future presence
of Ojibwe people

819
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:14,428
in northern Wisconsin.

820
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:17,497
And so the questions
around tourism and conservation

821
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:20,000
in northern Wisconsin
paralleled the rise

822
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:21,869
of Native activism
and advocacy

823
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,805
both in the state
and across the country.

824
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,341
The Native activism
and advocacy movements

825
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:29,376
in the 1960s and '70s

826
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:32,112
are often characterized
by the Red Power movement,

827
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,949
the takeover of Alcatraz,
the creations of organizations

828
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:38,318
like the
National Indian Youth Council

829
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,820
and the American
Indian Movement's

830
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,688
growing national presence.

831
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:43,223
But the roots of Red Power,

832
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,427
as Paul Rosier contends,
go much deeper than that.

833
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,896
In northern Wisconsin,

834
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:51,064
contestations
over lands and resources

835
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:54,101
often spilled
onto reservation lands.

836
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,203
In the summer of 1969,

837
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,605
Ron DePerry had just come home
to Red Cliff

838
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,275
after a three-year stint
in the Army.

839
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,343
There was a lot of talk
on the rez

840
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,646
about the ongoing arrests
of Native people

841
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:07,181
by state game wardens

842
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:10,017
for off-reservation
hunting and fishing.

843
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,920
Game wardens even came
onto the reservations,

844
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:15,923
arresting and jailing
Ojibwe people for small offenses

845
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:19,159
like having old deer hides
in their sheds.

846
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,495
Another time,
DePerry and two other men

847
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:22,796
were harassed by a game warden

848
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:25,599
when they left the reservation
to hunt deer.

849
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:29,002
After about 20 minutes,
DePerry lit up his pipe.

850
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:30,604
The men
told the game warden

851
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,807
to either arrest them
or let them go.

852
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,609
The game warden
went chest to chest

853
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,945
with DePerry,
telling him to, quote,

854
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:39,580
"Keep your mouth shut,
DePerry,

855
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:42,916
or I'll take that pipe of yours
and shove it down your"--

856
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:46,653
word I cannot say
on PBS Wisconsin-- "throat."

857
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,322
End quote.

858
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:51,892
But Ojibwe people in Wisconsin
continued to hunt and fish

859
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,695
under the terms of the treaties
I outlined earlier.

860
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:57,264
Our ancestors claimed
these rights for us,

861
00:39:57,331 --> 00:40:00,033
and I think the continued
exercise of those rights

862
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,002
is an incredible testament
to their strength

863
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,804
and their foresight.

864
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:05,806
The contestations
over these rights

865
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,642
also underscore the importance
of understanding

866
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:14,014
not only treaty rights, but
the importance of conservation.

867
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,049
The back-and-forth
with state officials

868
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:20,454
culminated in a 1969 protest
in Lake Superior.

869
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,824
For reasons
I haven't yet uncovered,

870
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:25,959
I haven't quite
figured this out yet,

871
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:29,062
Wisconsin DNR officials
announced that Red Cliff

872
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:34,368
and Bad River could
no longer fish in Lake Superior.

873
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,904
They could fish
in the inland rivers and lakes,

874
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,672
but their off-reservation rights

875
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:42,209
no longer extended
to Lake Superior.

876
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:44,678
And so people at Red Cliff,
Bad River,

877
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:48,515
and the other four Wisconsin
Ojibwe reservations,

878
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,417
Lac Courte Oreilles,
Lac du Flambeau,

879
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,186
St. Croix, and Mole Lake,

880
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:55,556
decided on a dual show
of protest.

881
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,925
And so St. Croix men
would go out one night

882
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,727
to be arrested for hunting
off the reservation,

883
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,564
and Red Cliff men would set
a net in Lake Superior

884
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,567
the next day
to be arrested for fishing.

885
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,635
They called
the local TV stations.

886
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:11,638
They called the local newspapers
to let them know

887
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,941
that Red Cliff
and St. Croix citizens

888
00:41:14,007 --> 00:41:15,509
were going out to test

889
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:18,946
the hunting and fishing rights
of the treaties.

890
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:22,015
And so a Red Cliff elder
named Franklin Basina

891
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:25,118
lent the Red Cliff fishers
two flat-bottom boats

892
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,987
to bring in the catch.

893
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:29,990
And so DePerry,
Roger Basina, and Allen Bear

894
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,425
were in one boat.

895
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,861
Red Cliff tribal chairman
Philip Gordon,

896
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:36,196
Red Cliff vice chairman
Richard Gurnoe,

897
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,764
everybody knew him as Dick,

898
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:41,034
and Louis Peterson
were in the second boat.

899
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:44,271
And so they hear
a boat motor running

900
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,507
as they went out
to set the net.

901
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,876
And so the boat did not
have its running lights on,

902
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:50,978
but they could tell
from the sound of the motor

903
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:53,514
that it was
a game warden's boat.

904
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,016
And so what they did
is they called

905
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,418
the Coast Guard station
in Bayfield

906
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:01,021
to let them know that
a boat anchored off the shore

907
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:03,757
of Red Cliff was in distress.

908
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:08,328
And so they watched as the boat
turned its running lights on

909
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:10,764
and headed back
toward Bayfield.

910
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:13,734
And so it was time
to set the net.

911
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:17,070
And so the next day,
a crowd gathers

912
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:19,773
when it's time to take the net
out of the water.

913
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,409
There were lots of folks
from Red Cliff there,

914
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,011
including women,
including elders,

915
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:25,679
who held signs and banners

916
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:30,584
that proclaimed "Protect Treaty
Rights" and "Indian Power."

917
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:32,753
DePerry remembered
seeing representatives

918
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,955
from TV stations
and newspapers,

919
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:38,792
local fishermen who came to lend
support to Red Cliff's cause,

920
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:42,229
and a group of students from the
University of Wisconsin-Superior

921
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:44,731
who had heard about the fish-in.

922
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:48,335
And so the game warden's boat
was there to meet them.

923
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,772
The men lifted the net, and
Gordon pulled out the only fish

924
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,475
they had caught,
which was a sucker.

925
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,411
Cheers rang out
from the shoreline,

926
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:59,279
and the cheers continued

927
00:42:59,346 --> 00:43:02,783
as the wardens placed
the six men under arrest.

928
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,352
The men were taken to
the Bayfield County Courthouse,

929
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:08,589
which was filled to the brim
with their supporters.

930
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:11,091
The men pleaded not guilty.

931
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:12,926
The case wound its way
through the courts

932
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:14,528
until the
Wisconsin Supreme Court

933
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,497
handed down its ruling in 1972.

934
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:20,634
The court ruled
that while Ojibwe people

935
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:24,037
did not have the exclusive right
to fish in Lake Superior,

936
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,106
the state had to prove

937
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:29,510
that any regulations
it sought to enforce

938
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:31,445
against Ojibwe fishers

939
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:34,281
had to be reasonable
and/or necessary

940
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:38,852
to prevent a significant drop
in the fish population.

941
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:41,622
And so, after the state's
decision came down,

942
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:44,458
Ojibwe treaty rights advocacy
in northern Wisconsin

943
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:48,295
expanded to both the regulation
of tribal fisheries

944
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,531
and collaboration
with the state.

945
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:52,332
Red Cliff and Bad River

946
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:54,835
joined the Grand Portage
and Fond du Lac bands

947
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,069
of Minnesota Ojibwe

948
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:58,405
and Michigan's
Bay Mills community

949
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:01,942
to collectively manage
their 1854 treaty rights

950
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:04,945
to fish in Lake Superior
under the umbrella

951
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:08,982
of the Great Lakes Indian
Fisheries Commission in 1982.

952
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:12,052
Okay, so that's
one organization.

953
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,755
And then the six Ojibwe bands
in Wisconsin

954
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,190
also came together

955
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:18,458
as the Voigt Intertribal
Task Force

956
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:21,495
in the wake of another Ojibwe
fishing rights case

957
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:23,830
that wound its way
through the system.

958
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:25,566
The two organizations,
all right,

959
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:27,301
so we've got
the fisheries commission here,

960
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:29,636
and we've got
the task force over here.

961
00:44:29,703 --> 00:44:34,174
They started holding joint
meetings in the spring of 1983,

962
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,743
and the two nations,
some of which overlapped.

963
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,514
Okay, I finally figured it out,
but I got there, okay,

964
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:43,150
came together
in June of 1984

965
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:47,087
to create the Great Lakes Indian
Fish and Wildlife Commission,

966
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:49,256
also known as GLIFWC.

967
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:52,226
And so, since its inception,

968
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,962
GLIFWC has been tasked
with conducting

969
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:58,298
basic scientific research
on individual species

970
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,535
to determine
an annual harvesting limit.

971
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:03,437
It helps its member nations

972
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,306
develop conservation enforcement
capabilities.

973
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:11,445
It supports tribal attorneys if
there is any ongoing litigation.

974
00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:13,947
It helps explain
the history and practice

975
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,283
of Ojibwe treaty rights
to the public.

976
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,554
And it works to secure funds
for all of these tasks.

977
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:24,358
And so GLIFWC continues
to undertake intensive studies.

978
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:27,361
They publish multiple reports
every year

979
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:29,396
on everything
from hunting summaries

980
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:33,100
and species assessments
to more recent studies

981
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,602
on the cumulative
environmental risk of pipelines

982
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:37,504
in the ceded territories

983
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:42,743
and revitalizing conceptions
of climate knowledge.

984
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,478
And so this photo,

985
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:48,582
this is from Frog Bay
Tribal National Park

986
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:50,484
on the Red Cliff Reservation.

987
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:53,787
It's a picture I took,
oh, gosh, not many years ago.

988
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,589
Some years ago
by this point, okay,

989
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:57,324
when my mom and I
went up there.

990
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:59,393
And so as a historian,

991
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:02,663
I love the stories
that we find

992
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:05,265
in our individual
and collective pasts.

993
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:07,701
And I love how they offer us
a deeper appreciation

994
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:12,005
and understanding of the places
that mean so much to us.

995
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:15,042
Scholar Keith Basso has,
perhaps somewhat rhetorically,

996
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:19,046
asked, "What do people make
of places?"

997
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:22,783
This question he wrote in 1996,
is, quote,

998
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,786
"as old as people
and places themselves,

999
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:29,323
as old as human attachments
to portions of the Earth."

1000
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:30,891
End quote.

1001
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,893
And I hope that the stories
I've shared here today

1002
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,095
have demonstrated not only
the importance

1003
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:37,264
of treaty rights and tourism,

1004
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:41,602
but the ways in which they've
come to be mostly complementary

1005
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:44,605
and not entirely oppositional.

1006
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,845
If you head
to northern Wisconsin today,

1007
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:53,647
you'll still see the legacy

1008
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:56,550
of these historical moments
and movements.

1009
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:58,318
The Apostle Islands region

1010
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:01,188
is still a renowned destination
for tourists,

1011
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:03,290
drawing thousands of people
each year

1012
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:05,158
for everything
from the Bayfield Applefest,

1013
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:10,264
pictured here, to the sea caves,
hiking, kayaking, and camping.

1014
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,599
Some of my
best childhood memories

1015
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,635
come out of
Applefest weekend.

1016
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,671
Whether it's, you know, tagging
along with my mom and grandma

1017
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:20,174
as they picked apples
at Erickson's Orchard,

1018
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,509
or taking notes of all
of the stands

1019
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:25,846
selling caramel apples
before making my final decision.

1020
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:28,549
I'm definitely a purist
when it comes to caramel apples,

1021
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:32,186
but I appreciate the ingenuity,
okay?

1022
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:36,056
And so the Ojibwe presence
in the region

1023
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:39,793
still reminds us of our past,
present, and future.

1024
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,563
Red Cliff now hosts
an annual language camp,

1025
00:47:42,629 --> 00:47:45,065
and I was fortunate enough
to bring my family back

1026
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:47,067
for this a few years ago.

1027
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:50,671
Our kids got to participate
in all kinds of activities.

1028
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:53,006
That's my little one painting
right there,

1029
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:56,643
my other one
playing a game over there.

1030
00:47:57,144 --> 00:47:59,046
And I'll never forget
watching them play

1031
00:47:59,112 --> 00:48:00,214
under the pines

1032
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,416
on the reservation's
Raspberry Campgrounds.

1033
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:05,319
We also played tourist
and took our kids on the ferry

1034
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,921
over to Madeline Island, which
I always wanted to do as a kid,

1035
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:11,091
and my grandma always said no,
so I finally got to do it.

1036
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:14,928
And so we toured the museum
on the island,

1037
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,096
which is really well done,

1038
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,731
and it's really a testament
to the work

1039
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:20,868
that the historical society does
throughout the state.

1040
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:24,304
And one of the volunteers
turned out to be the son

1041
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:27,107
of one of my grandma's
dearest friends.

1042
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:29,810
And so our kids and I
are suckers

1043
00:48:29,877 --> 00:48:33,380
for any kind of museum store,
all right?

1044
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:34,948
And both of our kids
conned me.

1045
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:36,583
My husband wasn't there,
all right,

1046
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,353
because they knew I was
the weak link.

1047
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:42,389
And both kids conned me
into buying them a rock.

1048
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:44,825
It was, you know, they were
probably about like this big.

1049
00:48:44,892 --> 00:48:47,427
And it has a bear paw
carved into it.

1050
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,396
And so it was
one of those moments

1051
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:52,799
where the things you teach
your kids come back to bite you.

1052
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,868
Especially because
our older one looked at me

1053
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,804
and he was like,
"Aren't we Bear Clan?

1054
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:01,074
Why wouldn't you want us
to have this?"

1055
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:04,478
So I considered
that my additional donation

1056
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:08,348
to the Wisconsin
Historical Society for the year.

1057
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:10,984
But it's moments like that,

1058
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:14,254
that really emphasize the
importance of these histories

1059
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,756
and these stories.

1060
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,357
And I actually found

1061
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:19,726
that bear paw rock
in our younger son's desk

1062
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:22,663
the other day,
and I couldn't help but smile.

1063
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:25,065
You know, I don't know how much
he remembers from this trip.

1064
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:27,067
It was a couple of years ago
by this point.

1065
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:30,504
But it reminded me that the work
we do as historians,

1066
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:34,842
as scholars and as activists,
always has a purpose.

1067
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:38,178
And with that, I will say
Miigwech bizindawiyeg noongom.

1068
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:41,582
Thank you
for listening to me today.
