[bright music]

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,338
- Angela Fitzgerald: If you
grew up in Shawano County,

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,074
there's a good chance you've
heard of Twig's.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,377
And if you grew up in Wisconsin,
there's an even better chance

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,747
your childhood included
Sun Drop soda.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,751
- Dan Hartwig: Sun Drop came out
in the early '50s.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,753
It's the first gold drink,

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,156
the golden cola
that was on the market.

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,526
- Angela: Dan Hartwig's family
knows a thing or two

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,327
about this citrus soda.

11
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,096
Just ask Ben.

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,298
- Ben Hartwig: Before Sun Drop
was actually even a soda,

13
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,799
it was considered a lemonade.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,469
And that's why you see them call
it the "golden cola."

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,273
And then in 1953, Sun Drop
was introduced to us.

16
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,575
- Most people think that
we invented it,

17
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:45,245
but actually it was invented
by guy named Charles Lazier

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,747
out of St. Louis.

19
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,316
- He asked my grandpa
if he wanted to bottle

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,919
and distribute Sun Drop
up in this area.

21
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,389
And it's been our
most popular product since.

22
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,391
- Angela: But in order
to get the full story

23
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,892
behind this bottled beverage...

24
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,228
- Jake Hartwig: Twig's has
a vast history in Shawano.

25
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,697
- Angela: ...you have to go back
three-quarters of a century

26
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,699
to a man they call Twig.

27
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,101
- Ben: My grandpa, Floyd
Hartwig, started the business.

28
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,003
- Diane Hartwig: Twig's was
founded by my father-in-law

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,371
in the early '50s.

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,109
Then in 1986, my husband and I
bought it from his father.

31
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,978
- I always worked with my dad,

32
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,047
and I got to know him
as good as anybody.

33
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,149
And we came up with this idea.

34
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,318
- They always called him Twig,
that was his nickname.

35
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,653
So they decided to call the
business Twig's Beverage.

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,056
- Angela: Ever since Twig
started the business,

37
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,959
the Hartwigs have had a heart
for Shawano.

38
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,560
- My father, he grew up
in Shawano,

39
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,128
just like all of us.

40
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,664
It's a great place to live.

41
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,868
- Jake: I'm proud of staying
in a small town,

42
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,803
staying in Shawano, being local.

43
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,805
Twig's gives us that
opportunity.

44
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,207
- Angela: And there's something
else about this area

45
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,042
that Twig's tapped into.

46
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,446
- Yeah, Shawano water, it's
just the greatest water.

47
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,348
There were two big breweries
in town

48
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,451
and maybe three
bottling companies.

49
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,721
These guys came to Shawano
to start their factories

50
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,756
just because of the water.

51
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,425
We actually started
bottling the water.

52
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,861
- Angela: In addition
to water and Sun Drop,

53
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,131
Twig's also bottles
its own brand of sodas.

54
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,734
- We're known for a lot
of our Twig's flavors.

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,037
Root beer, black cherry,
blue raspberry.

56
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,072
Those are our
more popular ones.

57
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,675
- People will come in
with 10 to 40 cases

58
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,178
that they'll need refilled,
and they come from all over

59
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,113
with their pickup trucks
and their vans,

60
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,185
and they may bring it to their
homes or to their cabins.

61
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,487
- Angela: This family business

62
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,989
occupies a place
in Shawano history.

63
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,324
[Dan laughing]

64
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:41,161
Today, the Hartwigs' family
is preserving Twig's history

65
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,465
one bottle, one case,
and one memory at a time.

66
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,334
- It's unique.

67
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,236
I don't think there's anywhere
like it.

68
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,437
- Ben: Over here, you'll see

69
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,606
a lot of different
advertisements that we've had.

70
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,374
It's kinda cool nowadays,
people say, like,

71
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,244
"Oh, yeah, we used to have this
Sun Drop sign on our bar,

72
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,847
restaurant, or grocery store."

73
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,915
- Angela: Twig's is a true sign
of the times

74
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:06,320
that continues to attract
visitors from near and far.

75
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,322
- I think what draws
a lot of people here

76
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,490
is that they want to come
and see live bottling.

77
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,526
[bottles clanking]

78
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,830
- We're the last returnable
bottler for Sun Drop

79
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,131
in the world.

80
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,234
Some individuals like it 'cause
of the nostalgia feel

81
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,435
that it gives
from drinking soda

82
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,936
from a glass bottle.

83
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,005
- Angela: For fans of those
glass bottles...

84
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,173
- Seventy-nine.

85
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,975
- Angela: ...they are all
stamped with a date

86
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,710
when they first hit
the production line.

87
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,211
- Eighty-five.

88
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,280
So those are old ones.

89
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,781
- Angela: Through the years,

90
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,452
the bottom line of bottling
has always been family.

91
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,654
- I love being part of the
family business, you know?

92
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,890
It's great to see
where we've started

93
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,525
and where we've come to now.

94
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,427
- It's something that
I think about all the time.

95
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,564
I'm proud that Twig's has been
able to stay local.

96
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,332
I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

97
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,169
- They say family businesses are
the salt of the earth,

98
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,371
kind of the backbone
of small communities.

99
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,140
And especially in a town like
Shawano, it's very true.

100
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,475
There's nothing else like it.

101
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,910
- I've stayed here all my life.

102
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,812
I've been working here
for 54 years.

103
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,383
I don't plan on leaving
unless my boys kick me out.

104
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,787
I'm proud that they're still
sticking around.

105
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,789
