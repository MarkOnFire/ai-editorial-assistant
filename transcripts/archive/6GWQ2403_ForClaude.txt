[speaking Lakota]

10
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm glad you're here.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,000
My name is Bonnie LeBeaux.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,792
My Lakota name, my given Lakota
name is Wigmunke Was'te Win.

13
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,999
It is, I am a fourth-generation
carrier of that name.

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,834
My grandmother gave it to me

15
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,041
after I came home
from the service.

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,333
I served in the Navy
for three years

17
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,667
as a cryptologic technician.

18
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:57,792
I have been quilting
for approximately 28 years.

19
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,834
This is my presentation.

20
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,291
"Align Yourself
with the Stars."

21
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,166
That's kind of,
like, my tagline.

22
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:11,208
I'm Lakota on my father's side,
Diné Navajo on my mother's side.

23
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,709
So yes, this is me.

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:13,999
A few of my hobbies,

25
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:18,000
I like to occasionally
jump on my motorcycle.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a little, a little
different now that I'm 50.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,041
[all laugh]

28
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:29,999
Yes, my sewing and my
daughter's cat. [laughs]

29
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:30,750
So like I said,

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,999
my name in Lakota
is Wigmunke Was'te Win.

31
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,999
I wanted to show you a map

32
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,750
of what my father's people,
the Lakota,

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,999
the territory that we covered
prior to colonization.

34
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:50,041
We were a nation that was
all the way from Canada

35
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,999
all the way down
to Oklahoma area.

36
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,999
From Wisconsin all the way
to the Rocky Mountains

37
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,417
is what our territory
we covered.

38
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:05,000
So the Lakota Nation
is one of three

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,875
of what we call
the Oceti Sakowin.

40
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,375
And of course, I'm Lakota,

41
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:15,333
and within the Lakota Nation,
there are different bands,

42
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,999
and there are seven of them.

43
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:20,542
My family comes
from the Oohenumpa,

44
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,250
which translates
to "Two Kettle."

45
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,999
So that's where
my family is from.

46
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,625
Currently, the
Cheyenne River Reservation

47
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,417
where I grew up,
born and raised,

48
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,999
is approximately
3 million acres.

49
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,333
We have a,
the land base is probably

50
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,709
about the size of Connecticut.

51
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,999
We have 16,000 enrolled members,

52
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,999
not all living
within the boundaries

53
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,250
of the
Cheyenne River Reservation.

54
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,667
The reservation was
established in 1868,

55
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,999
and I am proud to say
that today,

56
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,792
my brother is
actually the chairman.

57
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:04,667
So yeah, that's kind of a bonus.
[chuckles]

58
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,834
Within the boundaries of the
Cheyenne River Reservation,

59
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,999
when the reservation
was created,

60
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:14,458
the bands of the
Lakota people dispersed

61
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:20,208
throughout the territories
within South Dakota.

62
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:24,750
My reservation, we recognize
four of those bands,

63
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,333
and you can see those
on the flag

64
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,041
in the lower right-hand corner.

65
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,999
So with my presentation,
"Align Yourself with the Stars,"

66
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:41,625
I'd like to go over with you
the beginning of the star quilt

67
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:47,291
prior to its introduction
to the Native people.

68
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,834
And then I'd like
to share with you

69
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:52,999
a couple of short,
brief Lakota star stories

70
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:58,083
that correlate with the design
of the star.

71
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:02,999
And then I will go over with you
the reasons and why

72
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:08,291
and when we give a star quilt
within my family.

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,083
I will share with you my
history, my family history,

74
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,417
and then I have a
little portfolio,

75
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:17,250
and we will do questions
after that.

76
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,417
So in the beginning,
prior to colonization,

77
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:29,834
the Lakota people
depended on the buffalo.

78
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:39,375
Our societies actually
mimicked the life of a buffalo

79
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,792
and the way that they...

80
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,625
The way that they
lived on the prairie.

81
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,208
So, like, for instance,

82
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:57,959
a buffalo will have a calf
every two or three years.

83
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,542
And it is our custom
to have a child

84
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:07,250
within that timeframe so that
your children are spaced

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,000
within that
two to three-year period.

86
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,041
I followed that with my kids.

87
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,999
Sometimes I wonder still if
that was the right thing to do.

88
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,834
[all laugh]
But yes, I had my kids young.

89
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:25,834
So all my three kids
are all over the age of 20.

90
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,291
Another example would be

91
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,834
that when the buffalo
are under attack,

92
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,999
they surround them,
they surround the youth,

93
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:40,375
the female buffaloes,
the wounded.

94
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:45,458
The younger buffaloes will
make a protection around them.

95
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:51,458
And of course, that's what
we did prior to colonization.

96
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:55,542
That's what our warriors did
for our women and children.

97
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,999
So when the...

98
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,999
After the Dawes Act in,

99
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,792
I can't remember the year,
but the... [chuckles]

100
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,917
It's really hard to talk about.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,083
They wanted to get rid of us,
basically.

102
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:21,709
So they said, "Okay, well, we
need to get rid of the buffalo."

103
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,709
And that's what this picture
correlates with.

104
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,959
This first picture on the left,
it is buffalo hides.

105
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,333
I think there are
about 50, I think,

106
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:37,999
I believe it was 40,000
buffalo hides in this camp here.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,333
So you can imagine
the amount of buffalo

108
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,999
that roamed the prairies.

109
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,291
And in correlation,
I cannot even fathom

110
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:51,250
how many people passed away
of my people.

111
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,999
The second picture, that's
a picture of my daughter.

112
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,875
We were visiting a museum.

113
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,125
And of course,
that's a famous picture,

114
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,417
all buffalo skulls.

115
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,333
So with the decline
of the buffalo,

116
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:11,000
which of course meant
the decline of people.

117
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,000
So in the beginning,

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,667
once the buffalo were starting
to be hunted and shot,

119
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,166
missionaries came to the area,

120
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:31,999
and they started schools
for the young Lakota people.

121
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:37,458
And not only the Lakota people,
but the Native population.

122
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,458
On the right is a picture
of the boarding school

123
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:46,083
that my grandmother went to
in South Dakota

124
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,291
when she was eight years old.

125
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,625
She had three siblings,

126
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,583
and they all went
to this boarding school.

127
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,999
The picture of the teepee
is actually the woman

128
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:02,834
that taught at the school.

129
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:07,750
This is her collection
of pictures in the Smithsonian.

130
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,834
That's where I got
these pictures from.

131
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,458
So this was everyday life

132
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,709
in what is called
the boarding school.

133
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:22,083
So they sent their, by law,
sent their children

134
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,333
to these missionary-type
boarding schools,

135
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:30,000
and they stayed there
for pretty much the full year.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,709
So if you can imagine
sending your child away

137
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:40,625
for a long time,
for throughout the whole year,

138
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:45,999
not being able to touch them,
hold them, kiss them.

139
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:54,875
This was the life for many
of our Native children

140
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,291
from the age of eight
to when they,

141
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,583
you can see that these gals

142
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,999
are probably teenage years,
I suppose.

143
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,999
And I, in my research,
I, it states that

144
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:12,208
for at least one hour
of education,

145
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,417
there was three hours of work.

146
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,417
So you need to imagine
actually how many,

147
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:23,125
how many hours of actual
education these children got.

148
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,999
This here is a different school.

149
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,667
So like I said,
one hour of education,

150
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,999
three hours of domestic work

151
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:37,709
to keep the boarding school
running.

152
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:43,959
But it did provide learning
how to do the modern-day sewing.

153
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,999
All of the girls probably
took classes, I suppose,

154
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,750
on how to use a sewing machine

155
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,875
and make different things.

156
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,999
So when the missionaries came,

157
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,750
it wasn't just the
boarding schools

158
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,083
that taught the children;
it was...

159
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:13,208
They also recruited the women
of the tribe to come and sew.

160
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,875
And they had sewing circles.

161
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,166
Of course, our women
knew how to sew already.

162
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,625
But of course, with machines,

163
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:23,458
and then with the missionaries,
they brought the,

164
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,999
what we now call
the lone star design,

165
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,500
which is the eight-pointed star.

166
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:34,750
And if you remember,
at that point in time,

167
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,625
the buffalo were on the decline.

168
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,917
And our people used the buffalo
for everything.

169
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:45,959
We used it for our shelter,
we used it for our survival

170
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,959
with, for food, our clothing.

171
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,375
Everything revolved
around the buffalo.

172
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,625
So with the decline
of the buffalo, we had some,

173
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,667
we needed something
to replace that.

174
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:05,959
And when this was, this pattern
was introduced, it clicked.

175
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,583
And we pretty much adopt,
we pretty much overdone

176
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:15,750
on the design, and that
is because of the star.

177
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:21,959
So we also call ourselves,

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
say that we come
from the Star Nation.

179
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,667
And when we say Star Nation,

180
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:31,375
that means the heavens,
the stars.

181
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,208
That we believe that
that is where we came from.

182
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,625
And so when they
introduced this pattern,

183
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,999
it's somewhat of a
geometrical pattern,

184
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:45,750
and you can see how it
correlates with the designs

185
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,000
that we were already using.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,166
So easy to put a star into any
part of those designs.

187
00:11:54,166 --> 00:12:00,999
So you could take this star
and manipulate it.

188
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:02,834
I don't have a picture of it,

189
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:06,417
but you can do half diamonds
the short way,

190
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,125
you can do half diamonds
the long way.

191
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,999
And so it was very easy
to manipulate this pattern

192
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,291
with the patterns that we were,

193
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,125
the designs that
we were already using.

194
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,500
So we come from the stars.

195
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,166
We believe that
when a baby is born,

196
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,333
it comes from the heavens
down to Earth.

197
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,458
So that Milky Way, when you see,
when you see it,

198
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,999
it makes this arc
across the sky.

199
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,208
And so the baby comes
from the Milky Way,

200
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:46,999
that path comes down to Earth,
and it receives a star quilt.

201
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,583
So throughout its life,
there's different times

202
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,999
that we would give the child,
the young adult, the adult,

203
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,875
the older person, a star quilt.

204
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,083
That's what would be gifted.

205
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,333
When we pass away,
then of course,

206
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,999
we're going back to the stars.

207
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,166
So then we make that journey
back into the star

208
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,959
and we walk that path,
and it's a circle.

209
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:20,750
So it's just a continuous circle
of life, I suppose.

210
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:27,625
This other picture is a photo
of the morning star,

211
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,999
and it is considered
by my people

212
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,375
the most sacred time of the day.

213
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:38,041
And it is when we like
to get up and pray.

214
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,959
I'm a morning person, so
mornings are always my favorite.

215
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,999
Nobody's awake except me.

216
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,166
So it's a perfect time
to meditate,

217
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,792
say your prayers, smudge.

218
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,999
Yeah, so that's one story,
the Milky Way story.

219
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,999
And then we have the Big Dipper.

220
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,291
So the Big Dipper
has seven stars,

221
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,667
and there's a couple
of different correlations

222
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,667
between the number seven.

223
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:17,291
So in my culture,
we have seven Lakota values,

224
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:23,333
and each star would represent
a value of generosity,

225
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,583
humbleness, leadership,
wisdom, and so forth.

226
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,583
So each star
represents in that way.

227
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,999
Like I said before, we are
called the Seven Council Fires.

228
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,000
So that's the number seven.

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,999
So this constellation is
very important to my people.

230
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,999
Let's see, there's one more.

231
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:56,125
So another story is the story
of Blue Woman.

232
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,250
It was said a long time ago
that the,

233
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,875
there was a star in the middle
of that cup, and it fell.

234
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,500
So there's a woman
and her name is Blue Woman,

235
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,834
and she sits in the middle
of that cup.

236
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,333
And when a baby is born,
she's the one

237
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,834
that lets it go through.

238
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,500
When we pass away,
she's also the one

239
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,291
that lets you back
on the other side.

240
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:20,999
So she sits there.

241
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:24,625
And there's also a joke
in my family, [laughs]

242
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,125
okay, if you haven't
learned your lesson,

243
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,291
she's gonna kick you back down.

244
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,166
[all laugh]

245
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,709
So yeah, that's, I don't know
if that part's true or not,

246
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:38,625
but yeah, that's the
Big Dipper story.

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,834
So why we give.

248
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:51,208
Like I said, when a baby
comes to earth,

249
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,083
it is gifted a star quilt

250
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,917
because we believe that
they came from the stars.

251
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,041
This little girl here,
this chubby little girl,

252
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,625
that's my daughter,
my youngest daughter.

253
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,542
At this point in time,
I was probably quilting

254
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:10,875
for maybe 10, 12 years.

255
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,999
And she received actually
about four star quilts.

256
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,999
My son, however, received one.

257
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,750
[all laugh]

258
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,542
So yeah, this is
a picture of her.

259
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:25,959
My grandmother gifted
her this quilt.

260
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,999
And then in the middle there,
that is my nephew Pierce.

261
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,834
He is actually
graduating Head Start.

262
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:40,291
He completed two years of Head
Start and he wanted a quilt.

263
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,999
So that was probably
his second quilt

264
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,999
that was gifted to him.

265
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,667
I think it was Iron Man.

266
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,999
There was an Iron Man theme
or something.

267
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:51,458
Yeah.

268
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,583
And then the other little girl,
that is also my niece.

269
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,125
She wanted<i>Frozen,
</i>I believe it was.

270
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,667
Yeah, so the young ones,

271
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,333
they get to pick out
what theme they like

272
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,125
at that point in time
in their life,

273
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:08,041
and I try to accommodate
that request.

274
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,333
So early in life, birth time,
they get a quilt,

275
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:17,000
and then it just keeps
rolling from there.

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,417
Sport accomplishments;
our young people love sports

277
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,999
where I live on the reservation.

278
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:29,999
Basketball has always been
the number-one sport. [laughs]

279
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:35,583
So the gentleman on the right

280
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,083
took his senior pictures
with the quilt

281
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:42,792
that his mother ordered from me,
and those are our school colors.

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,834
The girl on the left
is his sister,

283
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:48,999
and she was a cheerleader
for four years in high school,

284
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:53,625
and this was the last home game
that she cheered at,

285
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:59,999
and they honored her at the
gymnasium with a star quilt.

286
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:07,625
So that's another accomplishment
that we like to honor.

287
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,750
So when we say honor,
that's exactly what it is.

288
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,917
It's a accomplishment that
our young people make,

289
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:20,667
and we recognize that
for encouragement,

290
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:24,583
for, yeah, encouragement
to keep going

291
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,667
to do good things
for our people.

292
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,959
Graduation is another
accomplishment.

293
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:38,583
This first picture on the left
was an eighth grade graduation.

294
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,999
That's my brother and I.

295
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,333
We have two kids;
he has a kid, I have a kid.

296
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:48,667
They're both the same age,
and they are on the right,

297
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,625
Liana and Nation.

298
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,375
So this was the eighth grade
promotion ceremony

299
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,999
that they have a
big little to-do,

300
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,500
and they get,
the eighth-graders get quilts

301
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,709
and we honor them,
sing them a song,

302
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:08,166
and they move on
to high school. [chuckles]

303
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,375
The middle one is my cousin.

304
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,875
We made her that quilt
for her college graduation,

305
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,750
her four-year college
graduation.

306
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,375
Yes, graduation is actually
the biggest time of the year.

307
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,250
I have probably about 40,

308
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,291
40 to 50 quilt orders
for graduation.

309
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,583
I start my orders
right after Christmas.

310
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,792
People have already
put in orders for next year.

311
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:42,625
So yeah, so you can imagine
how hectic it gets

312
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,083
right after Christmas.

313
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,917
I have recently picked up
a couple of orders

314
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:47,999
from different schools.

315
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:51,542
A school in Iowa last year
ordered 50.

316
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,083
The year prior to that,
I think it was like,

317
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:59,041
a 35 order from somewhere
in Minnesota.

318
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,333
This is another eighth grade
graduation.

319
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,542
This is my nephew in the blue.

320
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,999
Before the school year started,
he said, "Auntie,

321
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,999
I'm graduating eighth grade;
I want a blue quilt."

322
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,959
And that's what he got.

323
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,542
[all laugh]

324
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:16,667
The middle is a
senior graduation.

325
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:21,500
We have at my school,
or at our local school,

326
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,834
they have what they call
the senior honoring.

327
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,959
So they take a special day
right before graduation

328
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,667
and they have a little powwow,
they're presented,

329
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,625
the family presents them
with quilts

330
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,250
and a feather at that time.

331
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,667
And we have a drum group
and it's just,

332
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,709
the gymnasium is full
of quilts and graduates

333
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:45,542
and good vibes
and lots of singing.

334
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,667
The other picture is my niece;
she graduated,

335
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,917
I think it's eighth grade.

336
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,417
Yeah, that was this past year.

337
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,999
My daughter and I were
gifting her the quilt,

338
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:03,333
and we wrapped them in the quilt
and get our pictures,

339
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,166
and move on
to the next graduate.

340
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,999
Not only are our graduations
a time of honoring,

341
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:16,709
but also, like I said,
major accomplishments.

342
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,875
The gentleman
in the turquoise quilt,

343
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:26,792
turquoise and black quilt,
his name is Dr. Weasel,

344
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:30,709
and he is a member of the
Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.

345
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,709
And he climbed Mount Everest.
[audience exclaims]

346
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:38,999
He was the first Cheyenne River
Sioux tribal member

347
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,999
to climb Mount Everest.

348
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,291
And yeah, they had
news articles on him,

349
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,375
and I was actually hired
to make a quilt for him.

350
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,834
And this was at our annual
Labor Day powwow, I think.

351
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:55,000
I believe it was last year
that he came

352
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and the tribe honored him
with a presentation

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,999
of the quilt and of course,
an honor song.

354
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:05,041
And everybody was there
that got to go

355
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,125
and shake hands with him.

356
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,250
And he got to tell his story.

357
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,875
It was quite an accomplishment.

358
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,625
The other picture is a picture
of my daughter and my son there.

359
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,583
This was during her graduation,
and they did a feather ceremony

360
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:24,999
where the graduates received
a feather from their family

361
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,417
and, of course, a quilt.

362
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,959
Another honoring, how we give.

363
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:41,583
There isn't any particular law
of how you need to give a quilt.

364
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,999
So this gentleman here
in the blue and black quilt,

365
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:48,999
he is the downstairs neighbor
to my daughters.

366
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,834
My daughters went to school
in Kansas this past year,

367
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,500
and he was their neighbor
downstairs,

368
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,709
and he just took care of them
like his own daughters.

369
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,999
And I was very grateful for him.

370
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,000
He watched out for them.

371
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,999
He just, he was
just always there.

372
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,458
So when my daughter Raya
graduated, she's,

373
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,999
I'm wrapping her in a quilt
on the other page

374
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,875
around the other picture.

375
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:19,166
We invited him over
to our Airbnb

376
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:24,250
and we honored him with a quilt
just to say thank you

377
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,500
for everything that
you have provided

378
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,667
for my family, for my girls.

379
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,959
And we sang him a little,
put him in the middle

380
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,000
of the living room
and wrapped him in a quilt

381
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,999
and said thank you,
and gave him a song.

382
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,625
And he was...

383
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,375
So it doesn't,
you don't have to be Native,

384
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,125
is what I'm trying
to get at, I guess.

385
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,500
The other picture is the
reception for my daughter.

386
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,166
She graduated Haskell.

387
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,959
That quilt was made
with the Haskell colors,

388
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:56,542
and you can kind of see
the Haskell emblem.

389
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,999
Yeah, so when
we make the honoring,

390
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,999
we put them in the center
of the people

391
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,083
and we wrap them with the quilt.

392
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,999
And she was very honored.
[chuckles]

393
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,709
She was very humbled by all
the people that showed up,

394
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:14,500
that traveled to Kansas
to celebrate with her.

395
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:23,999
Another way to honor somebody
that has passed

396
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,625
is we do what we call memorials.

397
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:32,000
And it's usually a year
after your loved one passes

398
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,999
is when we hold the memorial.

399
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:39,709
And that can include
something simple,

400
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:43,542
something that correlates
with the person,

401
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,333
the person's life.

402
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,709
It can be a grand event.

403
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:54,834
This one here in particular is
my cousin's stepdad's memorial.

404
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:59,125
So this was just a few weeks ago
or last week maybe.

405
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:03,125
She had ordered,
over the past year and a half,

406
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:07,417
ordered different colors
of quilts from me,

407
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,000
just a couple at a time.

408
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,458
So I think we ended up
with five.

409
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:17,375
So her stepdad was a men's
traditional fancy dancer.

410
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,000
He danced at powwows
for competition for,

411
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,917
I don't know how many years,
but he had passed

412
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,750
probably a little
over a year ago.

413
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,999
And her family decided
to have this

414
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:36,250
men's traditional fancy dance
competition at the powwow.

415
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,542
[chuckles]

416
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:40,999
So what they do
is they have this,

417
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,083
what they call a special.

418
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:48,875
During the powwow,
they will hire a drum group

419
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,999
and they will,
at this particular one,

420
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,999
they danced five songs.

421
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,291
So it's somewhat
of a competition.

422
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,999
So you dance your five songs
and they have judges

423
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,999
and they say, "Okay, you're out,
you're out, you're out."

424
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:04,375
And then they keep going
and then, "Okay, you're out,"

425
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:07,417
and pretty soon,
you're down to five dancers.

426
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,542
And then they categorize them.

427
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,959
First place gets this,
second place.

428
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:16,333
But in this event,
all five of them got a quilt.

429
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,166
I'm not sure what else
that they received,

430
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:23,000
but that's another way
to honor your loved one.

431
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,083
That's a popular way for people
that do the powwow circuit.

432
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:34,500
Another memorial
besides the powwow is rodeo.

433
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,667
I'm not quite sure
how it works, but...

434
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,917
So within the competition,

435
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,417
whoever has the
highest point ride,

436
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:45,667
I believe, or just a special,
I guess, is what.

437
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,375
So they give a star quilt.

438
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,959
Sometimes they'll add money
to the prize.

439
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:56,125
I know that the satin quilt
on the far left

440
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,208
was for a team roper.

441
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:03,417
And I'm not quite sure how
they decided that he won,

442
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:06,500
but this is the picture
that they sent me.

443
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,999
Another memorial
in honor of my friend's dad

444
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:13,917
was the winner of the
saddle bronc was given a quilt

445
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:17,667
and a buckle it looks like,
and probably money.

446
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:22,291
So that's another version
of a memorial.

447
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,500
Another type of memorial
would be a feed and giveaway.

448
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,709
This is my dad's giveaway
when he passed away.

449
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:34,834
We, for a whole year, we
gathered quilts, we made quilts,

450
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:35,834
we bought quilts.

451
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:38,500
And when the day came,
we fed the people that came

452
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,542
and we gave everything away.
[chuckles]

453
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:50,625
So that is how we judge wealth
in our culture.

454
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,250
It's not by how much
you accumulate;

455
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,375
it's by how much you give away.

456
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,875
So that's what
that represents in,

457
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,999
when I say giveaway,
a memorial giveaway.

458
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,999
Sometimes, families
will gather up to,

459
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,999
I've seen up to 50 quilts.

460
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,999
So they rent the gymnasium
and they hang all the quilts up,

461
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,625
and they have a feed
and honor song.

462
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,000
And sometimes,
they'll have what they call

463
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,250
a wiping of the tears ceremony.

464
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,792
And that is when
you have a ceremony

465
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:26,834
and you say, "Okay, your times
of grieving is over.

466
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,375
You need to move on
with your life."

467
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,999
The top picture
is actually a veteran

468
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:37,291
that came home from the service,

469
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:41,583
and he was honored
by his family with a quilt

470
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,625
and a Lakota name.

471
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,041
These are some
of the favorite quilts

472
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,667
that I like to make
is for veterans.

473
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:51,000
This one is actually
a Marine quilt,

474
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,999
and this will go to the lady
that ordered it for her veteran.

475
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,917
When, well, when I get home,
I guess. [laughs]

476
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,125
Baby quilt.

477
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:08,458
And then, who I come from.

478
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,208
So I am actually a
fourth-generation,

479
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,000
from what I know of,

480
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,041
fourth-generation
seamstress quilter.

481
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:21,834
My great-grandmother on my
father's side, Eudora Traversy,

482
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,542
I have quilt blocks of hers

483
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:24,625
that she made out
of flour sacks,

484
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:28,917
and I think that's very popular
back in those days.

485
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,208
She hand-embroidered on them.

486
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:36,583
My grandmother, Marcella, she...

487
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,999
From what I remember when I was
younger, she would come home

488
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,500
with these big rolls of satin,
shiny fabrics,

489
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,999
and she'd lay 'em out
on the living room floor

490
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:50,750
and pretty soon, the next day,

491
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,792
my aunts had a prom dress.
[laughs]

492
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,999
So she was not, you know,

493
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,999
in the beginning,
she wasn't really a quilter,

494
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,625
but she did make
baby quilts and...

495
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:04,000
But what I remember most
is the prom dresses

496
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,709
that she made for my aunts.

497
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:10,291
My mother is Diné, like I said,
she is Navajo.

498
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:14,667
She is from the Weaver Clan
for the Red Forehead.

499
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,000
She has been sewing
ever since I can remember.

500
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,542
Her graduation gift
from her mother

501
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,208
was an actual sewing machine.

502
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,999
And I remember that machine
sitting on the kitchen table

503
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,166
very vividly
because when dinner came,

504
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,083
I was the one that
had to pack it away

505
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:36,999
and put it back up when
dinner was over. [chuckles]

506
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:41,500
Yeah, so Lakota on my dad's side
and Diné on my mother's side,

507
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,999
and that's her mother
in the picture with her,

508
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,834
my grandmother,
and my three kids.

509
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:59,999
These are some exhibits
that I have had over,

510
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:04,375
well, over my career,
my quilting career.

511
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,583
You can see the buffalo quilt.

512
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,375
I have a buffalo quilt
displayed over in the hall

513
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,083
if you wanna go check that out.

514
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,000
And the eagle quilt.

515
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,999
And one of my quilt racks.

516
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:21,500
Yeah, and then, okay,
now we're back to the display.

517
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,959
So these are just quilts that
I have made over the years.

518
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,583
Unfortunately, I don't get
a picture of every quilt.

519
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:31,458
I think that I make
probably anywhere

520
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:37,583
from 275 to 300 quilts a year.

521
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,792
So...

522
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,375
So when-- I was just
over at the ladies

523
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,999
that are doing the appraisals,
and I was kind of listening.

524
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:54,041
And then you see the
extraordinary quilting,

525
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,625
there's no way that I could
make that many quilts

526
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,750
and do the custom quilting.

527
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,917
So this one here,
I did freehand on my machine,

528
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:06,667
just took the machine over
and freehanded it.

529
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,999
This one, oh, this one
I did freehand also.

530
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:12,917
So yeah, I find that
doing the freehand,

531
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:16,542
free-motion quilting
is a lot faster

532
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:21,999
than the computerized, which
this one here is computerized.

533
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,999
This one took me forever.

534
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:27,959
This one here is freehanded.

535
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,999
And then what to do
with all the extra cuttings

536
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:35,458
of the diamonds I made.

537
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,999
Tried to, tried to,
I try to use them.

538
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,291
But yeah, I made a bag,
a couple of bags,

539
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:45,083
and then I have another quilt
over in the hall

540
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,999
with just the diamonds.

541
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,583
So that was
kind of extraordinary.

542
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,917
If you guys could go
check that out.

543
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,625
This is a queen-size quilt.

544
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,542
I really do like
to work with the,

545
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,000
what we call sunset colors.

546
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:05,291
That is kind of my,
that's my favorite.

547
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,999
Pink, not so much my favorite.

548
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:10,250
[audience laughs]

549
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,875
Another veteran quilt.

550
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,667
This one is custom quilted for,

551
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,999
I believe that was,
like, for a raffle.

552
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:26,999
That's another popular thing
is people will raffle quilts.

553
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:28,041
They'll buy a quilt

554
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:32,333
and then they'll raffle it off
for whatever event.

555
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:41,000
Police officer quilt.

556
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's another popular item.

557
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,250
I think that is screen printed
on the corner,

558
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,834
if I remember right,
with the officer's name.

559
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,667
That may have been
a funeral quilt.

560
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,999
That's another time
that you get a quilt,

561
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:01,625
but you probably don't know it.
[all laugh]

562
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,125
Veteran quilt.

563
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,999
And the four colors,
the black, red, yellow, white,

564
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:12,875
those four colors are
significant within my culture.

565
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,250
Probably other cultures also.

566
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,999
It represents the
four cardinal directions.

567
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:25,834
Some say it represents the
four colors of the four races.

568
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:28,041
I don't know, maybe.

569
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,041
Another veteran quilt.

570
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,999
Sunset colors.

571
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,166
I don't remember
which one this is,

572
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:54,999
but I've made a few of those,
unfortunately.

573
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,458
This here was a wall hanging

574
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:03,709
that I won People's Choice
at Native Pop.

575
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:07,166
It's a Native art market
in Rapid City

576
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,625
that's held every summer.

577
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,917
I entered this
into the juried competition.

578
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:15,125
I did not win,
but I did win the next day,

579
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,000
the People's Choice award.

580
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,875
So this is a woman
in a headdress,

581
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:24,583
and it is in recognition
of one of the ladies

582
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:27,999
that fought at Battle
of the Little Big Horn.

583
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,750
We always were told
that women don't fight,

584
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,999
but yes, they did.

585
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:38,542
So she has her shawl
and the fringe,

586
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,208
and the little shells
on her dress.

587
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,792
I think she even has earrings.

588
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah, she does.

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,917
Oh, and then you can see the
horse hair coming off of the,

590
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,458
the war bonnet.

591
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,250
Baby quilt.

592
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,417
High school graduation quilt.

593
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,333
Another sunset one.

594
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,625
Baby quilt.

595
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:16,291
And of course,
the sunset quilt. [laughs]

596
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:19,125
Yeah, you can tell
that's my favorite.

597
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,125
And this is, this was
a wall hanging that went

598
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:26,834
to New York City;
prior to it going to New York,

599
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,375
my brother saw it
and he's like, "Wow, Bonnie,

600
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,375
you need to make that one
your logo."

601
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,917
So, of course, I did.

602
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,834
So yes, that's me,
Bonnie LeBeaux Quilts.

603
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,083
Align yourself with the stars.

604
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:43,125
I have a website,
Facebook, Instagram.

605
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,999
Thank you; wopila.

606
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,917
[audience applauds]

607
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,333
So I don't know if anybody
has any questions.

608
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,417
How much do I get for a quilt?

609
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,166
It depends on the size.

610
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:03,834
Full size, $395
is what I charge.

611
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:09,041
Of course, you could
probably go higher than that,

612
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:12,792
but I always like
to think that...

613
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:19,208
I don't; the people that are
buying it, buying the quilts

614
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,999
and what they're doing with it

615
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:23,792
has a lot to play
in that price also.

616
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,250
- Audience Member 1:
You do all the work yourself?

617
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,583
- I, up until a couple
of years ago, yes, I did.

618
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,999
I do have a couple ladies that
help me with the basic sewing,

619
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,709
and then they'll hand it off
to me to make the star.

620
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:40,417
And I do all my own
quilting though.

621
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:43,125
Yeah, I do have help
with the sewing.

622
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,500
You probably all know
how it goes when you see

623
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,999
the piece of fabric
that you just love.

624
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:50,792
Yeah, it's usually the fabric
that, with this one here,

625
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:55,709
this is what they call,
it's a company in Canada,

626
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:57,917
49 Dzine is what
they're called.

627
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:02,750
And it's, they specialize
in Native artists

628
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,999
and put their prints
into fabric.

629
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:08,917
So I came across this one here,
and I just basically

630
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:12,125
just matched the star
with the fabric.

631
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,000
[laughs]
Kind of did the opposite.

632
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,792
Yeah, thank you.

633
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,542
- Audience Member 2:
Do you have like a,

634
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,999
do you use the machine
to cut your stuff out

635
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:23,750
or do you, does everybody?

636
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,667
- No, I use a rotary cutter,
and my elbow can tell you.

637
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,291
[all laugh]

638
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:34,083
How many hours a week
do I spend sewing? [laughs]

639
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:40,583
My typical day, I am usually up
by, up and sewing by 6:00.

640
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:45,542
And then maybe 10:00 or so,
I'll take a break

641
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,999
and then do what I have to do.

642
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:51,458
Go check the mail,
all the boring stuff. [laughs]

643
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:54,750
And then back to sewing
and quilting.

644
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,750
Yeah, it's my passion.

645
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,375
People will say, "Well,
don't you get sick of it?"

646
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,792
No, I don't.

647
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,000
So yeah, it's my passion.

648
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:09,041
Oh, do I prefer
a specific type of fabric?

649
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,417
It depends on the design.

650
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,583
I have done quilts
with cotton and satin.

651
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,709
So like this one here,
I've mixed.

652
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:24,999
You can see there's a satin,
the black satin.

653
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,500
I've made entirely satin quilts.

654
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:35,792
I, for me, I don't,
it doesn't matter.

655
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:40,291
I guess I figure that
my grandmother made quilts

656
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,250
with flour sacks,

657
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,083
so I can make quilts
with whatever I want. [laughs]

658
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,333
But yeah, but like I said,

659
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,458
I was with the
appraisers earlier

660
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:55,125
and I'm like, wow, there's
so much that goes into a quilt

661
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:59,500
if you want to make it
an antique, I guess.

662
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,917
- Audience Member 3: Could you
talk a little bit more

663
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,999
about when the star quilt
came to your people?

664
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,125
Was it late 1800s, early?

665
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:10,959
- We kind of traced it back
to between 1880,

666
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,999
somewhere in there.

667
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,999
Like I said, it would've started

668
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:21,000
like on this side of the
United States, Wisconsin area,

669
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,583
and then made its way
further west.

670
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:28,125
So we figured probably
about 1880, somewhere in there.

671
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,750
Maybe earlier,
because the school

672
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,500
that my grandmother went to,
St. Mary's or St. Elizabeth's,

673
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,999
that was established
in 1890, I believe.

674
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:45,999
So we know that they were there
in South Dakota at that time.

675
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:47,208
Yeah.

676
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,999
- Audience Member 4:
You mentioned seven stars

677
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:50,999
and that that meant a lot
to your people,

678
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:52,542
but your quilts are eight stars.

679
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,583
Can you explain that again?

680
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:58,500
- Just the fact
that this is a star.

681
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,999
- Oh.
- Yeah, it doesn't have

682
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,208
anything to do with the points.

683
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,291
Yeah, it's just the fact
that it's just the one star

684
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:08,999
and it was easily manipulated
into the geometric patterns.

685
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,333
She asked if the quilts

686
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,333
that were given away
at the giveaway

687
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:18,667
were the property of the person
that passed away.

688
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,999
So for my family, when my
grandmother passed away,

689
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:24,875
she had a whole stack of quilts.

690
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,417
And she used to say,
"You can judge your own life

691
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,999
"by however many times
you've been honored

692
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,709
with a star quilt."

693
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,125
So she had a whole stack.

694
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,000
She was a remarkable woman.

695
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,291
For her quilts, mostly they
went to family members.

696
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,875
And then when
we had her memorial,

697
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,542
we collected the quilts
over the years

698
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:49,792
and gave new quilts.

699
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,125
Yeah; did you have a question?

700
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,333
- Audience Member 5: How big
is your sewing room?

701
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:58,999
- [laughs] Well,
I've had one, two,

702
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,999
I've had four
different sewing spaces

703
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,792
over my quilting career.

704
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:07,999
The first one was of course
in the kitchen. [laughs]

705
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,041
My, one morning I woke up

706
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,750
and my daughters were packing
my stuff off the table

707
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,917
and they said,
"You're moving downstairs."

708
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:15,875
So that's what I did.

709
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,999
Yeah, and then I moved
from basement

710
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,000
to the next house basement.

711
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,417
And now I have my own quilting
space, my own work studio

712
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:27,083
that I just recently moved into
over the last couple of months.

713
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:30,333
So that's something new
that I am adjusting to.

714
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,999
I don't get to roll out of bed
and go downstairs.

715
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:36,917
I have to drive.
[all laugh]

716
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:37,834
Yeah.

717
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,041
Do I use a longarm?

718
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:39,917
Yes, I have.

719
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:42,417
My very first machine
was a Nolting.

720
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,667
That's what I used to do
the free-hand on.

721
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:49,583
And within the last six years,
I had purchased a Gammill,

722
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,750
and that's the computerized.

723
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,917
So I have two machines.
[laughs]

724
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,999
Do I have younger members
of my family

725
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:57,834
that are teaching,
that I'm teaching?

726
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:01,999
Yeah, both of my daughters
know how to make star quilts.

727
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:05,208
My mother will help me.

728
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,583
She doesn't like to,
but she will. [laughs]

729
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:12,583
She's more, she's more
of a clothing person.

730
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:15,917
So yeah, I have two daughters
that will help me.

731
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:19,208
They do know how,
but they haven't picked it up

732
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,417
as a passion, yeah.

733
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:25,166
Do I use a program
to design my work?

734
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,583
No, I don't.

735
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:30,667
I did purchase one,
but it just...

736
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:35,083
It was taking too long to learn.

737
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,709
So this is what I use.

738
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,792
I just use my color pencils

739
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:42,291
and make my designs out
on paper.

740
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:47,999
If I, you know, if I have to,
if I have to see it on paper.

741
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,542
Something like this though,

742
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:54,291
I'll just use the colors
and arrange 'em and sew 'em.

743
00:43:54,291 --> 00:44:00,750
Nothing really, really
technical, techy about that.

744
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:07,667
She asked how long it takes me
to piece a pattern, a quilt.

745
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,999
If I were to sit down,
start to finish,

746
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:17,000
I could probably finish a quilt
in six to eight hours.

747
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:23,291
When my dad passed away,
I did one in four.

748
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:26,250
Yeah, start to finish, yeah.

749
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,625
I do the strip method.

750
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,999
So I would sew one, two, three,

751
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:32,999
four, five, six strips
all together.

752
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:36,625
And then do one
for each section,

753
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,250
each line of the diamond,

754
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,959
and then you'd cut 'em
on the diagonal

755
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:43,583
and then you sew the strips
together this way.

756
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,792
So then you have
one big diamond.

757
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:50,166
And then you sew this diamond
against that diamond.

758
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:53,000
This section, this section,
this section, this section.

759
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,999
And then you put two with four
and then two and two.

760
00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:02,041
And then you put your corners in
and the borders.

761
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,083
Well, thank you everybody.

762
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,792
Wopila for having me.
