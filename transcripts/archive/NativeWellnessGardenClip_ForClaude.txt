1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:05,750
- Angela:
Nestled just off a busy road
on the south side of Milwaukee,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,125
is a gardener's paradise,

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,458
the Native Wellness Garden.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,375
I'm meeting up
with Lisa,

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,291
the Community Outreach
Coordinator,

6
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,999
to get a tour
of the growing space

7
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,375
and learn how the garden
supports the work

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,583
of the Gerald L. Ignace
Indian Health Center.

9
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,166
- Lisa Albright:
So, this area of the garden

10
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,125
where we grow
our medicinal medicines.

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,999
There are four:

12
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,834
there's sweet grass,
there's sage,

13
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:30,999
there is tobacco,

14
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:34,542
and then, over there,
we have our cedar trees.

15
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,125
- I notice that
on the signs, too,

16
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,583
you have the plant type

17
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,709
written out
in more than one language.

18
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:40,417
- That is correct.

19
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,999
So, it's written in English
and as well as in Ojibwe.

20
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,417
That was an art project
that was taken

21
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,959
on a few years ago
by the native youth.

22
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,458
They put
these signs together

23
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,999
and painted them
for our medicinal plants.

24
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:53,625
- All right.

25
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,291
So, we've talked about tobacco,
cedar, sweet grass, sage,

26
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,291
and I think
a medicine wheel is up next

27
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,375
that we may be able
to check out.

28
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,458
- That's right.

29
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,333
We can head right over

30
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,750
and check out
the medicine wheel.

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,999
- Okay, perfect.
- Thank you.

32
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,999
[gentle music]

33
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,542
It was created
by a UWM intern.

34
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,125
It took him two seasons
to create it.

35
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:19,834
- Oh.

36
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,999
- And he has broken up
the entire circle

37
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,375
into four different quadrants.

38
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,999
The plants that are within
that quadrant are representative

39
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:31,792
of what is medicinal
in that area of the country.

40
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,709
- Angela: Very nice.

41
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,917
- Lisa: We do have a binder
that he put together for us

42
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:39,083
and labeled each
and every plant, what they do,

43
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,999
what their
medicinal purposes are.

44
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,667
So we have found that
through this garden, we are

45
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:47,375
able to grow healthy food,
where they're able to come out

46
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,625
pick the produce,
or they can come

47
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,999
to our health center,
and they can get free produce

48
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,083
which helps
with your overall diet.

49
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,999
- Angela: Yes.
- So many chronic diseases,

50
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,917
it all comes back
to your diet.

51
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:02,750
And so if we can make
healthy food more accessible

52
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,999
for our patients
as well as our community,

53
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,208
that's just a win-win
for all of us.

54
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,999
- Angela: Absolutely.

55
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,500
It's a win for everyone,

56
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,834
including the community
gardeners with plots here.

57
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:20,709
I met with one of those growers
volunteering in the garden.

58
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,458
- I've been a member
for four years now,

59
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,125
and I started out
growing zucchini,

60
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,542
and just different plants
that I have never tried before.

61
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:29,875
- Tammy: This year,
we're doing onions

62
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,999
and green beans and such,
and I'm really enjoying it.

63
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:33,792
- Awesome.

64
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:34,917
And is there
anything significant

65
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,999
about this particular space
for you as a gardener?

66
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:39,417
- I just like the atmosphere,
in general.

67
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,083
You've seen the beautiful trees
and just the setting,

68
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,458
just very peaceful and relaxing,

69
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,500
and it just makes you feel,
like you said,

70
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,875
like a community and everybody
learns from each other

71
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,417
and it's just a very rewarding
experience for me.
