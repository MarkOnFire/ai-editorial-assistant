00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:09,542
- Welcome toUniversity Place
 Presents.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,333
I'm Norman Gilliland.

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,542
For several generations now,

5
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:18,041
many a parent has been tempted
to plop their child down

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,542
in front of some kind of video
in order to keep them quiet.

7
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,750
But what sort of video?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,792
That may have changed
over the years,

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:26,999
and so might the content.

10
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:30,875
And the question is,
one of the questions is,

11
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,458
what are the children
getting out of it,

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:37,750
and how young does a child
get anything out of video

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,792
of one kind or another?

14
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,875
With me is Heather Kirkorian,

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,125
professor of family studies
and human development

16
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,041
at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison,

17
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,208
and welcome toUniversity Place
 Presents.

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,667
- Thanks, Norman;
it's good to be here with you.

19
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,333
- I have to ask a
personal question first.

20
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,250
What did you watch as a child,
and what did you get out of it?

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,959
- Oh, gosh.

22
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,166
I promise this is not because
I'm here with you today,

23
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,709
but I watched a lot of PBS
when I was growing up.

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,999
<i>Mister Rogers, Sesame Street.
</i>- Norman: Great.

25
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:11,083
And you remember what
from those programs?

26
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,667
- I remember a lot
of very specific moments.

27
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,999
One thing in particular
I remember is Fred Rogers

28
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:19,000
on<i>Mister Rogers'
 Neighborhood</i>talking to us

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,959
as the kid audience
very directly

30
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,999
about what it means to be on TV
and that he's there with us,

31
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:25,999
but not really in person,

32
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,959
and I can't reach out
and take his popcorn.

33
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,542
I remember that scene
very vividly

34
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:31,750
and use it in teaching a lot.

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,542
- So he told you about
the illusion right away?

36
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,041
- Right away.

37
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,999
I was four or five years old
at the time, yep.

38
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,500
- This would've been
television, as we've said,

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,417
but of course,
now there are all kinds

40
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:44,583
of other forms of video.

41
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,041
And in your many studies,

42
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,417
what kind of forms of video
have you looked at?

43
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,041
- Yeah, so I study kids
using different types

44
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:52,999
of digital media.

45
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,041
Video's the most
common thing I study,

46
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,959
but I've also looked at toddlers
and touchscreens,

47
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,709
if they use touchscreen apps,
e-books, or just simple books

48
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,709
that are presented
on a tablet computer.

49
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,999
- What age group did you study?

50
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,750
How far back, how young?

51
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,000
- My youngest research is with
infants around one year old,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,500
about 12 months old, and then
up to 5 and a half or so.

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,959
- How do you determine anything
about what a one-year-old

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,208
is going to get out
of any kind of video?

55
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,000
- It's a great question.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,999
One of my favorite tools
for the youngest kids

57
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:23,999
is eye tracking.

58
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,208
So we use specialized cameras

59
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,625
that can monitor
where kids are looking

60
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,000
when they're watching video,
and that can tell us quite a bit

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,667
about whether they're tracking
the action and the story

62
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,125
or just looking at things
that are moving around a lot.

63
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,500
- And what do you deduce
from those studies

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,792
of one-year-olds?

65
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:38,458
- From one-year-olds,

66
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,458
they look at things
that move around a lot.

67
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,917
So they're not
typically tracking

68
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,375
what the characters
are talking about, for example.

69
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,041
They'll look at whatever

70
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,083
is most salient on the screen,
what's moving,

71
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,083
where there's a lot
of visual contrast,

72
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,250
like bright against dark,

73
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,667
and they're less likely
to follow the action

74
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,166
or anticipate
what's coming next.

75
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,999
- Norman: And color?

76
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,667
- Yeah, so color contrast
in particular.

77
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,709
So not that they're looking
at a particular color

78
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,208
like red versus blue,
but if there's contrast,

79
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,999
like one sharp color
against another,

80
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,834
that tends to draw
their attention.

81
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,792
- And do you have a sense now
as to, let's say,

82
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,875
the proportions of the media use

83
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,500
and what the children
are listening to?

84
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,166
- Yeah, definitely.

85
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,625
So research from
Common Sense Media tells us

86
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,291
that even though kids

87
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,333
are shifting a lot of their
screen time to mobile devices,

88
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,999
so they're using
tablet computers

89
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,999
and smartphones much more
than watching TV

90
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,083
on a household TV set.

91
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,959
Even though those devices
have changed,

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,999
most of what they're doing
is still watching TV

93
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,875
and video content.

94
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,375
So they're watching it
on a mobile device

95
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,750
instead of a household TV set
to an increasing degree.

96
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,417
But the vast majority,

97
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,125
something like three-fourths
of what they're watching,

98
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,667
is still video rather than apps,
or games, or other things.

99
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:51,083
- And in case you need
a visual representation

100
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:51,999
of those proportions,

101
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,041
we have it right here
in a pie chart format for you.

102
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:55,834
Give you some idea

103
00:03:55,834 --> 00:04:01,291
of the amount of time
children spend watching

104
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,000
or the proportions
of the media that they watch

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,917
and the time they invest
in each one.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,999
What kind of differences
do you see?

107
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,208
I mean, if you're
saying the content

108
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,417
is essentially the same,
what kind of,

109
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,333
what behavioral differences
do you see coming out

110
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,417
of the use of these
various media?

111
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,709
- Yeah, so in some ways,
video viewing is video viewing,

112
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,792
and it doesn't really matter
what device you're using,

113
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,083
but there are some differences.

114
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,542
The content itself has changed
a lot over time.

115
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,875
For example,
pace is much faster now

116
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,417
than it was several decades ago.

117
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,458
So some things
have changed a lot.

118
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,000
The delivery mode
has changed a lot,

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,250
so the youngest kids
are spending much more time

120
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,875
on streaming media.

121
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,959
So streaming video platforms
like YouTube,

122
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,792
much more than broadcast TV.

123
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,583
So more on-demand
streaming content.

124
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,417
The way advertising comes
into play has changed a lot.

125
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,250
So all sorts of things
have changed a lot,

126
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,959
even though the act of watching
video might be the same.

127
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,291
- Well, you have a
couple of threads there

128
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,458
that I'd like to pull.

129
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,917
One is the advertising.

130
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,208
How has that changed over time

131
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,999
when it comes to children
in particular?

132
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,999
- Yeah, well, I think
one way that it's changed

133
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:09,500
is when it was just broadcast TV
when I was growing up,

134
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,125
it might be ad-free

135
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,500
or it might have very
predictable ad blocks

136
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,959
that are targeted to children.

137
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,083
Now we're seeing more ads
that interrupt content

138
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,208
or ads that might be
directed at older adults,

139
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,709
like advertisements
for cars you might,

140
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:22,999
parents might purchase,
for example,

141
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,917
showing up in streaming media
channels for young kids.

142
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,333
- So it's kind of a one-room
schoolhouse in a way.

143
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,417
Everybody's getting
the same thing,

144
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,375
no matter how old or young
they may be.

145
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,875
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

146
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,709
- And we have
another chart here too

147
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:38,667
that we can't resist looking at,

148
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:42,250
and that has this bar graph
giving us the idea

149
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,999
of viewing at certain ages.

150
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:48,625
And is that just because
of what you just said, Heather,

151
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,041
that a one-year-old is not
going to get a lot out of it

152
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:55,999
and therefore the programming
is gonna be pitched higher?

153
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,083
- Heather: Yeah, so screen time
definitely increases with age,

154
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,875
and that's due
to a lot of reasons.

155
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,291
Part of it is that
as kids get older,

156
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,250
they ask for screen time more,
so they're requesting it

157
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,999
or turning it on
themselves a lot more.

158
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,417
And some of it is that
messaging has got out there.

159
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,083
The American Academy
of Pediatrics

160
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,291
has discouraged screen time

161
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,208
for kids under two
for many years now,

162
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,999
and parents are increasingly
aware of that recommendation,

163
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,667
so they're less likely
to have a lot of screen time

164
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,375
for those younger kids.

165
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:26,750
- And the other question I had
has to do with just the speed,

166
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,750
or, let's say,
the brevity of the shots,

167
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,375
the pacing of these programs.

168
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,999
If you've ever just kind of
accidentally, let's say,

169
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,250
gone by somebody's house

170
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,083
where their screen
was very prominent.

171
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,417
You're not hearing the audio,

172
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:46,291
you're just seeing how fast
those shots change.

173
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,709
What kind of measurement
do you see in that change,

174
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,417
and is it related, do you think,
to attention span or what?

175
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,333
- Yeah, so those shots,

176
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,917
so those shots
you're talking about

177
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:55,959
have gotten shorter over time.

178
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,625
So the average length
of a shot in movies

179
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:02,458
and TV shows has shortened over
time since when I was a kid.

180
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:03,959
We find that
that,

181
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,999
we used to think that
that had an impact

182
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,375
on things like attention span.

183
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,166
That if kids are watching

184
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,417
really fast-paced TV shows,
for example,

185
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,959
it will shorten attention span
in the real world.

186
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,999
There's not a lot of evidence
to hold that up.

187
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,959
The pace itself doesn't
seem to matter very much

188
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,750
in terms of attention span.

189
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,834
What does seem to matter
a bit is the content.

190
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:26,417
So if kids are watching sort
of fantastical, goofy content,

191
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,709
then they might have
less inhibitory control

192
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:32,458
after watching that
than if it's very calm

193
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,125
and natural content.

194
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,709
- It does seem that a lot of,
or I'm hypothesizing here

195
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,834
or maybe basing it
on personal experience

196
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,458
as having watched
certainly my share of video

197
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,999
of one kind or the other
over the years.

198
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,375
It seems that a lot
of what you get out

199
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,999
of any kind of a video
has a lot to do

200
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,417
with what you bring to it,

201
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:58,583
what you respond to,
what you're interested in.

202
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,375
- Yep, that's exactly right.

203
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,999
So one of the biggest things
that research is focusing on now

204
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,250
is thinking about individual
child differences.

205
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,834
So what is their knowledge
of media?

206
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,709
What experience
do they have with media?

207
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,250
What are their
cognitive skills like?

208
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,875
What language skills
do they bring?

209
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,333
A whole host of things,
and that tends to moderate

210
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,208
what impact screen time has
on them.

211
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,291
So are they likely
to learn from it or not?

212
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,999
Are they likely
to have a lot of fussiness

213
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,750
and tantrums when screens
are taken away or not?

214
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,500
Those things differ a lot
from one child to the next.

215
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,999
- So in a sense, some children
do their own winnowing

216
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,667
and sifting when
they're watching stuff.

217
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,999
- Yeah.
- For better or worse

218
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,999
that stuff may be, they're
kind of sorting through it

219
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,999
and responding in a way that
reflects their interest,

220
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,999
their curiosity,
and their temperament too.

221
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:45,999
- That's exactly right.

222
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,709
Both in terms of what
they want to watch

223
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:51,834
or what they want to play
and what they remember from it.

224
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:52,999
- And what part,

225
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,250
getting back to kind of
the one-room school concept

226
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,583
but bringing it home,
what effect does the environment

227
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,959
that a child watches this
programming in have to do

228
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,875
in terms of the context,
who's around when they watch,

229
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,999
and what is their response?

230
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:10,999
- That's a great question.

231
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,291
This was understudied
for a long time,

232
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,000
but the research is moving in
this direction pretty rapidly,

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,250
thinking about the context in
which that media use happens.

234
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,041
So kids don't use media
in a bubble.

235
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,792
They don't watch TV in a bubble.

236
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,083
That's within a family context.

237
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,999
And it turns out,
it makes a big difference

238
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,999
if kids are watching videos
by themselves

239
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,083
versus with a caregiver,
for example.

240
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:29,999
They'll learn a lot more from it

241
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,959
if they're interacting with
someone else while they watch,

242
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,125
and they're less likely
to have some

243
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,000
of the potentially
more harmful effects,

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,834
like being frightened

245
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,999
by something scary they see
in TV, for example.

246
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,333
Similarly, the larger context.

247
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,667
So the effects of media
on child development

248
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,917
seem to be greater for kids

249
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,542
in lower-income homes,
for example,

250
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,458
both the positive
and negative effects.

251
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:51,999
- One of the negative effects

252
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,709
you've already mentioned,
Heather,

253
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,625
and that is withdrawal.

254
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:00,999
And how would a caregiver
of any kind,

255
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:05,625
whether it's a parent or a
professional outside the home,

256
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:09,083
deal with that
in terms of knowing

257
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,999
when to make it available,

258
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,999
this video in whatever form
it may be,

259
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:20,583
and knowing how to withdraw it
without a riot.

260
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:20,999
- Right.

261
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,959
One of the most common questions
I get from parents is,

262
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:24,583
"If I use screens,

263
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,999
how do I turn them off
without a meltdown?"

264
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,709
That's one of the most common
questions I get from parents.

265
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,333
And that's a real concern
for parents,

266
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,750
and for some kids
more than others.

267
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,917
In terms of when to use screens,

268
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,999
there are different kinds
of guidance around when,

269
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,999
in terms of the time of day
or at what age.

270
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:40,750
So the American Academy
of Pediatrics

271
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,999
has specific guidelines about
ages, and how much, and when.

272
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:48,917
They discourage screen use
for everybody, you and I,

273
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,999
you and me included,

274
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,417
in the hour before we go
to bed at night,

275
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,834
so in terms of time of day.

276
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,999
And in terms of when
to withdraw,

277
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,834
the American Academy
of Pediatrics has guidance

278
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,750
for how much time per day
as well.

279
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,041
I tend to focus less
on the time per day

280
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,208
as opposed to what
kids are doing

281
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,999
and what they might be missing
out on if they're on screens.

282
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,417
- We have a representation
of that here too.

283
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,500
Give you a little bit
of a cheat sheet

284
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,625
for any kind of caregiver

285
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,166
who is considering
using video in any form

286
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,709
to interact, let's say,
with a child.

287
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,417
And how do we interpret
these Cs, these five Cs?

288
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,625
- Heather: Yes, the five Cs.

289
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,458
It's a really useful framework

290
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,417
for thinking about kids
and screens at different ages,

291
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:32,500
and they have tailored advice
for kids at different ages,

292
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,999
if folks are interested
in looking that up.

293
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,999
But this comes from the American
Academy of Pediatrics, again,

294
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,959
the Center of Excellence
on Social Media

295
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:40,999
and Youth Mental Health.

296
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:41,875
They have guidance for kids,

297
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,750
from infants all the way up
through teens.

298
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,959
And the five Cs sort of tell us

299
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,333
what does the research say
about screen time and kids?

300
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,500
What should parents
really be thinking about

301
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,333
when they decide
whether to use media,

302
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,166
what kinds of media to use,
when, and how?

303
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,250
So thinking about the child,
which we've talked about.

304
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,999
Individual children respond
differently to screens,

305
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,083
and parents can adapt
their rules around screen time

306
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,625
to those individual needs
of children.

307
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,083
For example, whether they can
turn it off without a meltdown.

308
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,083
That's a big one.

309
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,709
The content they're watching,
we've talked about a bit.

310
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:12,583
That matters hugely.

311
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,667
The impact of screen time
on kids hugely depends

312
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,750
on the content they're watching.

313
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,792
Calm refers to whether media
is used as a calming device

314
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:21,875
and whether kids have other ways

315
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,500
to calm themselves down
other than using screens.

316
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,291
Crowding out refers to what
kids might be losing out on

317
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,709
if they're using screens.

318
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,333
We wanna make sure

319
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,291
they're getting enough sleep,
for example.

320
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:32,999
And communication.

321
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,333
So families are encouraged
to communicate early

322
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,875
and often with kids
about screens.

323
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,999
- Well, I remember scenes from
childhood in which a parent

324
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:44,542
or a grandparent just
came into a room and said,

325
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,792
"Go outside and play."

326
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:50,999
And actually, I think by then,
we were all ready for it anyway.

327
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,999
- That's right.
- So sometimes, it's, I guess,

328
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,417
getting a cue that you're
sort of hoping for anyway

329
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,709
would help out.
- Yep, that's right.

330
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,291
And I think in terms
of turning off screens,

331
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:02,999
it can be really helpful

332
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,125
to think about what kids
are in the middle of,

333
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,999
and letting them
finish their thought,

334
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,999
I think, is really helpful
in taking it away.

335
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,999
- Well, if you're talking
about a video game,

336
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,999
that's probably paramount,
isn't it?

337
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,333
- Right, getting to a goal
or an endpoint,

338
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,458
a natural endpoint in the game.

339
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,000
Turning it off in the middle
of a challenge

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,792
that you're trying to get over
can be really difficult.

341
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,917
- Well, I've seen
that kind of reaction

342
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,208
for technical breakdowns,
I think,

343
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,999
causing it among high school
students, for that matter.

344
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:33,125
You know, extreme distress

345
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,291
over getting to a certain level
in a video game

346
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,542
and then it suddenly cuts off.

347
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,875
- Yep, that's exactly right.

348
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,667
It's really frustrating.

349
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,834
I feel that way
as an adult sometimes.

350
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,333
- Well, we'll talk
about your video gaming

351
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,250
maybe a little later,

352
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,166
but in the meantime,
interaction,

353
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:53,208
or the interplay
between a child's temperament

354
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:58,667
and their video dependency,
let's say.

355
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,500
- Yeah, absolutely.

356
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,750
So there's some research now
really focused

357
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,208
on what the literature calls
problematic media use

358
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,125
in young children.

359
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,458
And there's some
evidence of this

360
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,709
as early as four years old.

361
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,458
It might emerge even sooner,

362
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,834
but the youngest kids
I've seen in the research

363
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:13,667
are four-year-olds.

364
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:17,041
And this is characterized
by certain behavior traits

365
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,125
that might suggest
problematic media use.

366
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,375
So that might be a
preoccupation with media,

367
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,750
like asking constantly even
after you've been told no

368
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,375
to turn the TV on, for example.

369
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,125
Sneaking media.

370
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,959
So older kids might
sneak a device

371
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,542
into the bedroom at night,
for example,

372
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,458
so they can watch videos
at night.

373
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,834
And having meltdowns
when told to turn the TV off

374
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,083
or turn the game off.

375
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,999
- Well, yes, and I,
again, not to put any,

376
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,917
too much of a burden
on today's generations,

377
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:50,917
but when I was a kid,
we actually, after bedtime,

378
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:54,959
sneaked down the street
to watch a certain show

379
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,333
on a neighbor's TV.

380
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,041
And since I don't remember
the repercussions,

381
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,999
we must have gotten
away with it.

382
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,999
- [laughing]
Right.

383
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,458
- But speaking of bedtime,
you mentioned earlier, Heather,

384
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:10,291
this idea that the experts
recommend against any kind

385
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,750
of screen time within an hour
of going to bed?

386
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,291
- That's right.

387
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,834
- You wanna apply that
to children as well as adults?

388
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,999
- Yeah, I think
that guidance applies.

389
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,917
So the American Academy
of Pediatrics focuses on kids,

390
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,999
but I've seen similar guidance
for adults too,

391
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,625
and I know a lot of adults
in my life

392
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,999
who try to follow that rule
for themselves for better sleep.

393
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,458
- And what is the,
what is the effect?

394
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,166
What is the problem with that?

395
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,583
- Yeah, there's pretty good
evidence, at least in adults,

396
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,999
that using screens,
especially mobile devices,

397
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,834
which we hold close to our faces
late at night before bed,

398
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:43,417
can disrupt sleep.

399
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,166
There are a lot of ideas
for why that might be the case,

400
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,333
and they're probably
all a little bit true.

401
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,999
So some folks have studied
blue light,

402
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,583
just the nature of light
that comes from the screens.

403
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,625
Others have focused
on time displacement.

404
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,792
So if you're on your screen
late at night,

405
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:57,999
you might stay up
a little bit later

406
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,667
than you otherwise would have
and get less sleep.

407
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,999
And then the quality of sleep
can also be disrupted

408
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,834
by the content
of what we're doing.

409
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,999
So if you're having,
reading upsetting news

410
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,999
or thinking about a work problem

411
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,999
or doing those kinds of things
late at night,

412
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,208
that's going
to disrupt sleep as well.

413
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,999
- Maybe even if you're
just reading an e-book.

414
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,166
- Right, so the content will
matter a lot, the activity,

415
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,999
so if you're using it to listen
to mindfulness meditations

416
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,875
before going to bed, right,
to help you fall asleep,

417
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,875
that's going to be
really different.

418
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,834
Or reading a book is going
to be really different.

419
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,500
Blue light can still be a
concern if that's a mechanism.

420
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,417
So turning the screen down
or using night mode

421
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,999
or dark mode
can be helpful there.

422
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:43,875
- Let's get into techniques
then that might be used.

423
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,625
And I know you have a video
for this too

424
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:54,291
that has techniques for
weaning children off of videos

425
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,999
when it's deemed necessary.

426
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:57,500
- Yeah, exactly.

427
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,542
So because this is one
of the most common questions

428
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,875
I get from parents, over time,
I've gathered tips

429
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,709
that researchers have suggested

430
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,709
that parents can use to help
make that transition easier.

431
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,999
So for some kids who
are really dysregulated,

432
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,000
that might need a bit more
guidance

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,709
if kids just have emotional
or behavioral dysregulation.

434
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,417
But for most kids, it's
really about habit-forming,

435
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,999
making things predictable,
setting clear guidance.

436
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:19,999
So if there are clear rules

437
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,792
and routines around when
screens can be used

438
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,999
and when they need
to be turned off,

439
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,959
that's really helpful for kids,
as it is for anything,

440
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,834
for bedtime routines
or any other routine.

441
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,959
Keeping it consistent
and predictable

442
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,959
is really important
for young kids,

443
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,375
so they know what's coming
and they know what's expected.

444
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:40,208
Rewarding kids for having
good self-regulation

445
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:40,999
is really helpful too.

446
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,999
So if kids give back the iPad,
for example,

447
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,417
when you say screen time's over,

448
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,333
that can be really helpful
for kids learning

449
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,583
that that's what
they should be doing.

450
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,417
"Yes, I gave it over nicely,
I didn't have a meltdown."

451
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,999
So those kinds of things
can be helpful.

452
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:57,250
And then there are ways that
we can use the media itself

453
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,999
to help us out.

454
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,208
So choosing media that
has natural endpoints,

455
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,583
avoiding things
like streaming media

456
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,999
with an endless
"up next" playlist,

457
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:08,625
and having a,
kind of time boxing the video

458
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,291
so that it's a
constrained playlist

459
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,083
with maybe two episodes
of something.

460
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,208
- Or yes, probably not watching
a two-and-a-half-hour movie.

461
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:18,999
- Right, exactly.

462
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,500
So if you wanna keep to 20
or 30 minutes of screen time,

463
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,792
choosing something that's that
amount of time is helpful.

464
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,999
Yep.
- That could apply also to,

465
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:31,083
to parent generation if
they're getting within an hour

466
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,375
or two of bedtime.
- That's exactly right.

467
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,375
It's harder for all of us now.

468
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,542
You know, we can watch an
entire season of something

469
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,917
on Netflix or something
before we go to bed.

470
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,999
Yeah, I mean, we all have
to sort of set those rules

471
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:43,999
for ourselves.

472
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:50,041
- And if we're talking
about commercials then,

473
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,583
how does that play into really,
do we see,

474
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,000
obviously I would think the
advertisers would see an effect

475
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,125
when they're advertising
to children.

476
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,208
Do we see negative effects
from that advertising, though?

477
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:04,999
- That's a good question.

478
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,000
I think it depends
on how you define negative.

479
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,458
So I completely agree with you.

480
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,500
A lot of the research on this

481
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,917
is proprietary corporate
research, so we can assume

482
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,917
it wouldn't be a
multibillion-dollar industry

483
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,083
if it wasn't effective.
- True.

484
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,875
- So they certainly
know that it works.

485
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,917
And there's other
academic research too

486
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:21,999
that suggests it works.

487
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,625
Whether you think
convincing kids

488
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,166
to want a product they
wouldn't have otherwise wanted

489
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:26,999
is a negative outcome.

490
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,166
I think reasonable people
might disagree

491
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,125
about whether that's negative.

492
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,583
I have my own opinions
about it I'll keep to myself,

493
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,291
but certainly, it has an effect

494
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,375
that it's sort of kids
are more likely

495
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,750
to want certain brands
over others

496
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,917
if they see advertising
for those brands.

497
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,208
- Oh, boy, yeah, that's the,

498
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,458
certainly the oldest principle
in the world

499
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,041
in terms of media of any kind,

500
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,792
whether it was pre-TV
in the days of radio.

501
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:56,959
You hear a lot of broadcasting
very brand-oriented

502
00:19:56,959 --> 00:20:00,625
in the commercials and,
of course, promising,

503
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,500
in a kind of a figurative way,

504
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,542
superpowers if you have
your cereal, you know,

505
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:10,291
your Sugar Pops or whatever
it might be in the morning.

506
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,000
- That's exactly right.

507
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,625
And the industry has some
self-regulatory bodies now

508
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,083
that help keep each other
in check a little bit

509
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,999
and try to keep things ethical.

510
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,375
So some of the concerns that
have been raised in the past

511
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,250
that are less of a concern now
are using, for example,

512
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,291
cartoon-like figures to sell
products that aren't for kids

513
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,625
like cigarettes, for example,
or alcohol.

514
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,000
So that has been
an issue in the past,

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,333
and it increased kids' interest
in having those things

516
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,542
because there's a
cool-looking cartoon character

517
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,208
on that package.

518
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,375
And that's regulated
a bit more now.

519
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,999
- Makes me ask about animation
in general.

520
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,458
Of course,
that's a very, very old

521
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,875
and venerable way
of entertaining children.

522
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,959
I mean,<i>Fantasia,</i>Walt Disney
had that figured out,

523
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,917
you know,
most of a century ago now.

524
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,917
However, when you get to
something like<i>The Simpsons,</i>

525
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,999
that's also animated.

526
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,041
- That's right.

527
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:07,000
- And so how are those
guidelines developed

528
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,709
to separate, or even should they
develop in a way

529
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,542
that would separate
a five-year-old,

530
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,999
a seven-year-old
from watching<i>The Simpsons,</i>

531
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:17,875
or are there others

532
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,999
that are even further
pushing the limits?

533
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:21,709
- Yeah, absolutely.

534
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,875
And this is a cue that
kids use very early on

535
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,999
when they detect, "Hey,
is this for me or not?"

536
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,834
Animation is one of the
quickest cues they learn.

537
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,083
Animated is for me.

538
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,750
At least that's been the case
for decades.

539
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,750
And that might change over time
as we get more

540
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,999
and more animated content
for teens and adults.

541
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,999
But they use that cue early on
to decide if it's for them,

542
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,083
and that can lead them
down a path

543
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,250
of choosing something they
think might be intended for them

544
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,792
that very much is not.

545
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:48,208
I think parent monitoring
is obviously a good way

546
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,208
to try to minimize that a bit.

547
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,709
And then also, there's stuff
that the industry can do

548
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,125
to make sure they're
not either intentionally

549
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:58,583
or unintentionally marketing
that information to young kids.

550
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,834
- Is there a way to,

551
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:03,709
like if you hand a young child
some kind of video device,

552
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:07,500
I'll say something handheld,
for example,

553
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:12,458
a way to have content control
over that?

554
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,625
- There is; you mean
in the device itself?

555
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,750
- Yes.
- Like to sort of force it?

556
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,375
It depends on the--

557
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,834
It's really about the apps
that one is using.

558
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,834
So, for example,

559
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:23,166
YouTube has some
pretty easy features,

560
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,208
like using YouTube Kids

561
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,583
as opposed to the
parent YouTube.

562
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:30,999
The main YouTube, I should say,
that parents are likely to use.

563
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,917
But that is just one step.

564
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,500
What I prefer to recommend
to parents

565
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,792
is having an opt-in
content solution.

566
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:39,500
So rather than saying,
"It's on YouTube Kids,

567
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,834
it's gonna be fine."

568
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,583
If parents have the time
and energy to do it,

569
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,999
curate their own playlist
of things their kid can watch

570
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,999
and set up what I call
a walled garden

571
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,875
so kids can watch the videos
that I, as the parent,

572
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,333
have selected to put
into this playlist.

573
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,959
That's all they have access to

574
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,166
because there's stuff that
can get through the filters

575
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,417
in moderation on YouTube Kids,
for example.

576
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,208
- Speaking of
content guidelines,

577
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,750
are these PBS guidelines
that we're seeing here?

578
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,750
- Heather: They're from the
organization Zero to Three.

579
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,583
They worked with researcher
Dr. Rachel Barr

580
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,667
to make these what
they call screen sense.

581
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,542
These are the E-AIMS,

582
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,250
so you can see on the screen
what that stands for.

583
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,750
And these are based on research
by a number

584
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,999
of developmental psychologists
focusing on what works

585
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,709
for young kids in general
for learning,

586
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,500
how do they learn well
in the real world,

587
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,542
and what does it take to apply
that to the digital realm?

588
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,208
So this is basically
their attempt

589
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,542
at translating that research

590
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,458
on how kids learn well
in the real world

591
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,999
to make it work on screens
as well.

592
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,000
- We haven't really
gotten into what kids

593
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,999
of various age groups,
other than the one-year-olds,

594
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:48,250
actually get out of video
in one form or another.

595
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,959
So let's take it all the way up
to two-year-olds for starters.

596
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:55,959
What do they see,
what do they think,

597
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,999
and what do they feel when
they're watching a video?

598
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,542
- Yeah, so even the youngest
kids will look at screens,

599
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,333
but we can tell a lot
from different ways

600
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,333
of studying kids' attention
to screens,

601
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,458
what are they actually
getting out of it?

602
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,625
And the research
for a long time suggested

603
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,875
it wasn't 'til about
two and a half years old or so

604
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:14,750
that kids made sense

605
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,500
of what we would think
of as television,

606
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,291
like an edited program
that has different scenes

607
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,083
and tells a story over time.

608
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,208
So it's not until about
two-and-a-half years old

609
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,999
that kids start to show
some evidence

610
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:28,625
of understanding that kind
of information

611
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,750
and being able to turn that

612
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,291
into something meaningful
in the real world.

613
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:32,999
But it takes a long time

614
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:36,917
for kids to become as good
as an adult at doing that.

615
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:37,999
- If we take something

616
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:40,250
that you wouldn't want
your child to see,

617
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,999
but for whatever reason
sees it anyway,

618
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,792
let's say a two-year-old,
three-year-old,

619
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:49,125
how would they react
to violence on TV?

620
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,291
- Yeah, that's
a great question.

621
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,083
So there are lots
of studies on this,

622
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,125
and we all have personal
anecdotes of something

623
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:54,999
that scared us on TV too.

624
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:57,999
And some kids are more sensitive
to that than others.

625
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,333
This is one of those.

626
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,999
The first of the five Cs
is child.

627
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,375
This is one of the ways
parents know their child best.

628
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,417
Is their child someone
who's really sensitive

629
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:08,208
to that kind of image
and will likely be really scared

630
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,291
and have trouble
sleeping at night

631
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,291
or be disturbed during the day
by that content.

632
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,709
Parents know best how their
child's likely to respond.

633
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,750
Some kids are more sensitive
to that than others,

634
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,999
but we all have anecdotes
of being scared

635
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,291
by something we saw on video.

636
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:23,375
There are things parents
can do to help minimize that.

637
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:26,542
And the best strategies
differ by the child age.

638
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:27,500
So for really young kids,

639
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,834
it's mostly useful
to have physical comfort.

640
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:33,750
So, you know, physical contact
with a caregiver

641
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,625
that they know and love,

642
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,625
or a stuffed animal,
or a blanket,

643
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,917
or something they know and love,
that kind of physical comfort.

644
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,917
The other good strategy for
young kids is just avoidance.

645
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,417
Not avoidance
of the conversation,

646
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,583
but avoidance of the content.

647
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:47,542
So trying to prevent kids
from seeing content

648
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:48,583
that's likely to scare them.

649
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,041
Older kids might be better able
to talk about it

650
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:54,999
and understand that's just fake,
it's on TV,

651
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,500
or that happened
really far away,

652
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,542
it's not going to happen here.

653
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,959
Those kinds of conversations
can be more effective

654
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,458
for older kids
than younger ones.

655
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,999
- How about TV as just
purely a distraction factor?

656
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,542
Children are in the room,

657
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,500
you have people
having a conversation,

658
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,999
maybe even somebody making
music, and you have a TV on.

659
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:19,999
- Yeah, this is really common
in that early image we had

660
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:22,000
of how much time
kids spend with screens

661
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,917
is a very much an underestimate

662
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,792
if we consider
secondhand TV exposure,

663
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:27,458
background TV exposure.

664
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,125
- Sounds like you're
talking about smoking now.

665
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,875
- Exactly.
- It's analogous, isn't it?

666
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:31,959
- It's a good analogy, exactly.

667
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,083
So you're exposed to it,
but you're not doing it.

668
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,041
So most studies
about kids' screen time

669
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,041
is asking about
when kids watch TV,

670
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,667
but they're exposed
to a lot more

671
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,625
than what they are
personally watching.

672
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,999
So that's really common,
and there's good research now

673
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:47,999
on what impact that has
on their attention and play

674
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,166
and those kinds of things.

675
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:49,999
So trying to minimize

676
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,999
that background distraction
can be helpful for young kids.

677
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,667
- And a challenge when
you have several kids,

678
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:59,291
for whatever reason,
all in the same close quarters.

679
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,166
- That's exactly right.

680
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,792
There's a good reason,
a good explanation

681
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,999
for why younger siblings
watch a lot more TV

682
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:04,999
than older siblings do.

683
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,166
- I mean, it's interesting
to be in a room with, like,

684
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:11,500
say, a one-year-old,
a four-year-old,

685
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,792
and a seven-year-old,

686
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:16,875
and you bring the
one-year-old into the room

687
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:20,999
and gravitates toward
whatever's on that screen,

688
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,166
whatever they're
getting out of it.

689
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,458
And you say, Heather,
it's not all that much,

690
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:31,000
but it's something that's
light, and colorful, and active,

691
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and they might just
kind of gaze at it,

692
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,041
but it does seem to just draw
their attention like a magnet.

693
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,125
- Yep, that's exactly right.

694
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,542
I mean, it's movement,
it's sound,

695
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,417
it's lots of change
happening very quickly.

696
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:44,709
All of those things
just tap into the brainstem

697
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,166
and make us look,
even if we don't want to.

698
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,166
And that's true for everybody,

699
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,500
but it's especially true
for young kids

700
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,792
who have less control
over their attention, yeah.

701
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:56,166
- Is this a representation
of a way of using

702
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:59,875
or the ways that media
regulate themselves?

703
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,667
Is that what we're seeing
in this graph?

704
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,417
- Heather: Yeah, this graph
is showing

705
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,792
what we call
regulatory media use.

706
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,250
So that's a long-winded way
of saying using media

707
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,667
to calm a child down, regulate
their emotions and behavior.

708
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,875
So this comes down to one
of those Cs called calm.

709
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,999
So that's using media
to calm children down

710
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:18,999
when children are upset,
or stressed, or hyper.

711
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:23,999
And so we find that that kind
of regulatory media use peaks

712
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:24,875
during the preschool years.

713
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,875
So you can see on the screen,
like, two to five years old,

714
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,792
we see that is the
most common age

715
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,125
when this kind of thing happens,
which is no surprise

716
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,999
because that's when
behavioral dysregulation

717
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,542
is at its highest, emotion
dysregulation is at its highest,

718
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:41,083
and kids are still figuring out
how to use their words

719
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,083
to explain what they need.

720
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,542
- I'm tempted to use that phrase

721
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:49,667
that we would apply
to other things

722
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,375
that people become
dependent upon.

723
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:55,458
You find children
with an addictive personality

724
00:28:55,458 --> 00:29:00,291
who fall afoul of video media?

725
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,792
- Yeah, this is the phrase
I used earlier,

726
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,625
problematic media use
is the more common phrase

727
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,208
in the literature.

728
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,500
A lot of people who study this
don't like the addiction word.

729
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,000
With young kids,

730
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,999
they don't think it's
the right word to use,

731
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:14,375
but I think it's a
similar class of behavior.

732
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:17,750
So letting it crowd out
other activities

733
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,458
that kids need, right?

734
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,583
That's the same kind
of behavior we might see

735
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,500
with addiction in adulthood.

736
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,291
Does it prevent you from getting
the things you need

737
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,917
to be healthy and happy?

738
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,291
So is it crowding out
other things?

739
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,999
Do children have
emotion dysregulation

740
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:30,999
so they get really upset

741
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,333
and have meltdowns
around screen time,

742
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,917
those kinds of things.

743
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,999
Some might consider
those precursors

744
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:39,333
to problematic media use.

745
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,999
Whether it's truly an addiction,

746
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,999
smarter people than me on that
topic even debate it still,

747
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,999
so it's hard to know
where we'll end up.

748
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,750
- Do you go so far, Heather,

749
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,500
as to recommend guidelines
for how much video

750
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:00,333
of various kinds a child
should have in a day?

751
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,917
- Yeah, the
pediatrician experts

752
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,709
have concrete guidance
around, like,

753
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:07,166
no more than an hour per day
for preschoolers,

754
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,375
none for kids under two.

755
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,458
I think a lot more about what
kids are doing in the day

756
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,083
and is screen time crowding out
the other things they do?

757
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,041
So I use charts
like the one you see

758
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,208
about thinking about
your child's day

759
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,999
as a zero-sum amount of time.

760
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,083
What kinds of things do you want
your child to have in that day?

761
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,792
We definitely want them
to get enough sleep.

762
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,959
We definitely--
- Norman: Sleep is a good one.

763
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,875
- Heather: That's a huge one.

764
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,291
And for the youngest kids,
that's, you know,

765
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:32,375
half their hours of the day
might be in sleep.

766
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,083
Are they losing out
on high-quality sleep

767
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:34,999
because of screen time?

768
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,917
If so, we might need
to address the screen time.

769
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:39,250
The same goes for high-quality
parent-child interaction,

770
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,999
physical activity, outdoor time,
time to think and be creative.

771
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:46,208
I wanna make sure kids get
good amounts of time in the day

772
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,458
to do all of those things.

773
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,166
And if they're doing that,

774
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,999
screen time is probably not
a huge concern for that child

775
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:54,999
as long as the content isn't
harmful, like scary or violent.

776
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:57,709
- Well, as a researcher,
how do you feel

777
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:01,250
about the family sitting down
to dinner together

778
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,750
and watching TV instead of
doing it the old-fashioned way

779
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,000
and sitting around
the dining room table?

780
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,834
- Yeah, meal times

781
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:10,500
is one of the number-one
recommended screen-free zones

782
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,667
for pediatricians.
- Is it?

783
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:15,417
- Right, so they recommend
identifying screen-free zones,

784
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,083
and they think meal times

785
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,792
is one of those we should
try to make screen-free.

786
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,500
And the reason for that

787
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,834
is because it's one
of those times where kids

788
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,333
and parents come together
and talk about their day

789
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,291
and open up about things,

790
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,000
so it can be one of those
protected spaces.

791
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,125
So I think for me, it's,

792
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,375
the other reasons
for meal times is that we,

793
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,999
research also shows
we eat a lot more

794
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:37,208
when we're watching TV while
eating than not watching TV.

795
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,834
- You're not even aware of it,
are you?

796
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,208
- Exactly, you're sort of
mindless eating, if you will.

797
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,000
So there are several reasons

798
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,999
to not have screens around you
while you're having meals.

799
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,125
That said, if parents find
other times in the day

800
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:50,875
to have distraction-free,
screen-free interactions,

801
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,417
to me, that's a good goal
to have,

802
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,999
even if it's not
during mealtime.

803
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,959
- And then there's
physical activity.

804
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,542
You know, back in the day,

805
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,667
for a lot of even
suburban neighborhoods,

806
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,291
you could get out,
you could, you know,

807
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,291
ride your bike
around the street,

808
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,709
you could play games that
nobody's ever heard of anymore,

809
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,417
and all that would
take place outside.

810
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,999
But if you're in a really,

811
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,750
an urban environment
or some other situation

812
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,041
where those outside activities
are not readily available

813
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:23,083
except maybe, you know,
at school for a period of time,

814
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,417
what's the solution to that,
do you think?

815
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,917
- Yeah, I think both outdoor
time and physical activity,

816
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:32,000
the two tend to go hand in hand,
although they don't have to.

817
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,999
I think this is a good example
of wanting to be aware

818
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,999
of screen time potentially
crowding out those things.

819
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,166
The context matters a lot,
as you said.

820
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,959
So the environment kids are in

821
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:45,291
might be more conducive
to outdoor play, physical play,

822
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,959
and physical activity,

823
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,041
more so for some kids
than others.

824
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,083
I think this is a place where
we can think of technology

825
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,917
being a potential solution too.

826
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:56,834
So especially during
peak pandemic,

827
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:57,959
there were a lot of families

828
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,083
who used different kinds
of videos

829
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,750
and games to get
physical activity

830
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,999
when they couldn't go
to the gym, for example.

831
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:06,917
So there are some
popular examples of games

832
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,875
and videos that get kids
to dance along

833
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,542
with someone on the screen,
for instance.

834
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:11,999
So that's one
of my favorite forms

835
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:13,792
of physical activity, actually,

836
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:17,792
playing video games where you
dance along with a character.

837
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:18,667
- Otherwise, it's your thumbs

838
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,917
that are getting all
the physical activity.

839
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:21,999
- Right, exactly.

840
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,917
That's exactly right.

841
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,999
- Do you play video games,
Heather?

842
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:25,999
- I do; some, a few.

843
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,834
I have a select set
that I play, yeah.

844
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,999
- And do you have criteria
for those?

845
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:30,750
- I do.

846
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,542
I have a pretty
narrow interest set

847
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,417
when it comes
to video games, yeah.

848
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:37,500
Yep, I like adventure
and puzzle-solving games

849
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,333
quite a bit.
- Well, okay.

850
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,041
And the puzzle solving,

851
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,792
well, those would be
physical too,

852
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:45,500
or they also can be
text-oriented.

853
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,667
- They tend to be
visual and spatial,

854
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:51,792
but using my thumbs
and not my body, yeah.

855
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:59,999
- As far as the various
alternatives to video

856
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:01,333
and all that
that we've talked about,

857
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,083
you have one more element here
that I'd like to talk about

858
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,709
in terms of maybe
a two-edged sword,

859
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,041
and that is the
role of creativity

860
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,999
interacting with video.

861
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,834
Is it a damper,
or is it a stimulant?

862
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,999
- Yeah, that's a good question.

863
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,917
There's not a huge amount
of research on this

864
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,208
compared to some other areas,
to be honest.

865
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,542
I think if we look at just
minutes per day,

866
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:22,542
screen time minutes per day

867
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:26,125
tends to be associated
with lower creativity.

868
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:29,875
But this is where content comes
into play quite a bit too.

869
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,709
So there are some shows, apps,

870
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:33,999
and games that are designed
to allow kids to be creative

871
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:37,333
or encourage creative thinking,
and they can be effective.

872
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,458
So content that's
explicitly designed

873
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,083
to help kids be creative
or create space for creativity,

874
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,999
like finger painting apps
and those kinds of things.

875
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,709
Those can encourage creativity

876
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,166
and inspire kids
to think more creatively,

877
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,999
but they have to be designed
very intentionally to do that.

878
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:57,999
- Well, and some efforts to do
that on TV do go way back.

879
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:02,500
There used to be a show
when I was a small child.

880
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,917
I won't name names
because it would date me,

881
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:10,000
but there was a show
that invited the children

882
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,667
to complete a drawing,

883
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,917
and in order to do this,
they would put,

884
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,667
they would have to send off
for this

885
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:16,917
for 25 cents or something,

886
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:19,999
a plastic screen on top
of the TV screen,

887
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:21,625
and they would draw, you know,

888
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,458
to complete whatever
animal or robot

889
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,792
or whatever it might be
on the screen.

890
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,750
The only problem being
children being impatient

891
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,375
didn't always wait
to get the screen,

892
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,041
and they would just go up

893
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,333
and draw right on top
of the TV screen. [laughs]

894
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:40,125
So I guess again,
parental guidance is necessary,

895
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,999
but it's interesting
how far back

896
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:47,417
that attempt to stimulate
creativity goes in video media.

897
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,125
- That's exactly right.

898
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,999
And some of the shows
I loved the most as a kid,

899
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:54,458
both PBS shows were art shows,
right?

900
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:57,250
We can all think of famous
examples of artists on TV

901
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,750
that we might watch do art.

902
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,583
And there was an artist on TV
when I was a kid

903
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:04,834
who was doing drawing lessons
for kids.

904
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:05,375
And I loved it.

905
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,083
I sat there with my paper
and followed along,

906
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:10,125
and was really interested
in illustration as a kid

907
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,875
because of that.

908
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:16,041
- And as we get into having
all these various kinds

909
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,417
of media available to us,

910
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,875
do you have any
kind of a breakdown,

911
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,750
and we've talked about overall
video time in a day,

912
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:29,000
but when you have TV,
and you have streaming on TV,

913
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,333
and you have a iPad,
and you have a cell phone,

914
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:39,709
all of which are
pretty manipulative

915
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,875
or can be manipulated
by the user,

916
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:42,999
it's not like
you're just watching

917
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,041
or not watching a program
or a channel.

918
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,125
Do you have any way of,
like, breaking that down

919
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:51,875
or do you just say overall video
use in the course of a day

920
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,000
that you would recommend?

921
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,375
- Yeah, so the most
common recommendations

922
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,999
are total minutes
of screen time.

923
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:59,291
I would say the
biggest breakdown we see

924
00:36:59,291 --> 00:36:59,999
in recommendations

925
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,083
is video chat being pulled out
into its own animal.

926
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,917
So video chat is seen
as something really different

927
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,208
and probably mostly positive
for young kids

928
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,959
if they're using video chat
to connect with relatives,

929
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,834
or family and friends,
or things like that.

930
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:14,875
So that's usually pulled out

931
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,999
and not included in screen time
recommendations.

932
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:22,375
But otherwise, e-books,
digital games, apps, TV, video,

933
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,250
they're all tend
to be lumped together

934
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,625
into screen time guidance.

935
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,667
For me, it depends
on the activity itself.

936
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,999
I think video chat's
different, of course,

937
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,250
but an app or a game
is really different

938
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,166
from watching video.

939
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,999
I care a lot more
about the content

940
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,999
than the activity
or device itself.

941
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,999
- Give us some idea
about video chats

942
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:41,417
since not everybody
will be familiar with it.

943
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:44,834
- Yeah, so folks use different
kinds of tools for this now,

944
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,834
but the most common ones
are using Zoom

945
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:51,959
or FaceTime on iDevices,
so using some kind of app

946
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,208
that allows you to connect
with someone in real time

947
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,375
the way you and I
are talking right now,

948
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,542
but through our screens.

949
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,959
- What age would you recommend,
and this gets a little bit more

950
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,458
into the sociological aspect
maybe,

951
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:08,417
but what age would you recommend
a child have access

952
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:08,999
to video chat

953
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:12,999
where they can talk
under the blanket or whatever

954
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:13,709
with the person next door

955
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:17,875
or down the street or in some
other country now, I suppose.

956
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,417
- Yeah, for me,
if it's for things

957
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,166
like connecting with family,
for example.

958
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,417
Folks that are
in the child's life

959
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,333
who might not be
physically present.

960
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,834
I don't have a minimum age
for that.

961
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,792
And this is assuming they're
doing it with supervision

962
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:34,125
and someone who can help them
understand what's happening

963
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,125
and engage.

964
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:35,999
So really young babies

965
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,000
aren't going to get a whole lot
out of that.

966
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,792
But we do know that
they can learn

967
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:40,999
to recognize people,
for example.

968
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,583
So when they see that person
in real life,

969
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,999
in 3D for the first time,

970
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,083
they might be quicker
to recognize that person

971
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,250
and be more comfortable
with them

972
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,208
if they've had that
video chat experience.

973
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,667
- And the facility
with these devices

974
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,999
is almost startling at times

975
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:58,208
when you talk about
small children.

976
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,625
I mean, I did see a
two-year-old one time

977
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:07,999
basing his track on an icon,
on the basis of just that icon,

978
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:11,250
actually called his father
on a cell phone.

979
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,999
- Mm-hmm.

980
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,333
- And are we seeing
more of that?

981
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:15,999
- Yep.

982
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,291
Yeah, kids are great learners,
right?

983
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,999
They learn to use
devices quickly,

984
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:20,999
and that's true for screens

985
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,291
and for a whole bunch
of devices.

986
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:26,458
Kids are just really great
at figuring out how things go.

987
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,208
So even really young kids,
toddlers,

988
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,125
are going to be really quick

989
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,417
at learning how to make
a screen device go,

990
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:33,917
how to make it do
something interesting

991
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,709
that might not be
a desired outcome

992
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,208
for the parents in the room.

993
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,999
So it's important that
we help supervise that

994
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:40,999
and help them know what's
appropriate and what's not,

995
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,583
and take away access to things
we don't want them to do,

996
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,792
like buying things
on the parents' credit card.

997
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,000
- I've heard stories
of that too.

998
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,999
Yes, racking up
some serious bills

999
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:51,999
because you're just
pushing the icon.

1000
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:53,625
- Indeed, yep.

1001
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,125
- In this research
that you're doing,

1002
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:59,333
what are you thinking
is the frontier?

1003
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,166
- Like the next big thing?

1004
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,999
Yeah, so a couple
of things, I think.

1005
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:05,125
We have a lot more to learn

1006
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,999
about individual differences
in kids.

1007
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,333
How are individual kids
affected,

1008
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,999
and what are some
warning signs for kids

1009
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:12,834
that might be
at greater risk of harm

1010
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,250
versus kids who
would really benefit

1011
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,750
from certain types of
learning games, for example.

1012
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,917
We know far too little, I think,

1013
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,125
about individual differences
in this world.

1014
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:22,875
That's something

1015
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,083
that's getting a lot more
attention right now.

1016
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:27,750
Another big frontier I think
that's just starting to happen

1017
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,041
is thinking about differences

1018
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:32,959
that happen within individual
kids or families over time.

1019
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,667
So we tend to think
of screen time

1020
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,041
as if it's fixed and static,

1021
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,125
like two hours a day,
and that's what we do.

1022
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,500
But in fact, some days we use
more screens than others.

1023
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,333
Some days we watch some kinds
of content than others.

1024
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,792
We might use video chat one day,
watch movies another day.

1025
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:47,709
We don't really know a lot

1026
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,999
about what it looks like
from day to day

1027
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,291
and how one day might be
more positive than another

1028
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,291
for an individual family
or person.

1029
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:57,250
- And we have seen,
speaking of differences,

1030
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,417
of course, in older minors,
teenagers, let's say,

1031
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:05,999
and even, I suppose,
people in their twenties

1032
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:10,333
who get a false concept
of body image

1033
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:14,999
or desirable body image
from Facebook

1034
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,834
or any number of other media.

1035
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:18,959
- Yep, that's exactly right.

1036
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,625
And a big part of that
is content.

1037
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,875
So being exposed
to certain types of content

1038
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:24,750
that encourage thinness

1039
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,500
or radical eating
or things like this.

1040
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,125
So the kinds of content
folks are exposed to

1041
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:30,999
can be really harmful.

1042
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,917
And we know those things
can fluctuate day to day,

1043
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:35,375
and they might feel more
positive some days than others.

1044
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:38,500
Knowing what predicts
positive days and bad days,

1045
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
days that make us feel better
about ourselves

1046
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,999
versus worse about ourselves,

1047
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,542
we know far too little
about that at this point.

1048
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:52,792
- In terms of planning
what your child should watch,

1049
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:56,999
you also have a plan
that you provide here,

1050
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:58,999
and let's have a look at that

1051
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:02,125
and see how that
might be implemented.

1052
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,625
- Heather: Yeah, I think one
of the easiest things

1053
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,834
parents can do is have a plan

1054
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:09,500
about what the rules are
going to be in their house

1055
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,166
and working with kids to
figure out what that might be,

1056
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,000
especially for older kids

1057
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,333
who are old enough
to think it through.

1058
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,375
Because some of the more
disruptive media use

1059
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,834
in our lives is when it's
reactive as opposed to planned.

1060
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,709
Like someone's
having a meltdown,

1061
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,208
quick, stop the meltdown,

1062
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,333
and rather
than thinking through,

1063
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,709
"How can I help this child
soothe themselves

1064
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:30,166
and learn how to self-regulate?"

1065
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,000
So having a plan in advance

1066
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,959
for how to tackle both
emotion disruptions in the day

1067
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,999
as well as when and how
to use media

1068
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:39,000
is helpful for everybody.

1069
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,583
It helps parents make decisions,

1070
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,625
it helps kids know
what to expect

1071
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,417
so they don't have meltdowns
about things.

1072
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:46,959
So having a plan is helpful.

1073
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:49,999
And there are different
strategies for doing that

1074
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:51,000
and different tools
for doing that.

1075
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,166
There are some good online tools
for helping families make a plan

1076
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,208
based on the age of their kids.

1077
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,999
So I think some of that is
about helping kids learn

1078
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:01,458
how to manage their own
screen time.

1079
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,999
So what we may call scaffolding
their own self-regulation

1080
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:05,750
around screen time.

1081
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,917
How do we help teach kids to
learn when they've had enough,

1082
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:09,625
when they need a break?

1083
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,792
Some of that is being
a good role model, saying,

1084
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:13,750
"Oh, I've had too much
screen time today,

1085
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,375
I'm gonna take a break."

1086
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,208
So we can model that.

1087
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,959
- Oh, yes, that's true
that some children,

1088
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,542
some individuals
going through life

1089
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:24,250
have more self-discipline
than others.

1090
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,667
- Yep, that's exactly right.

1091
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:26,542
I think you're right.

1092
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:27,667
That's true for adults too,
right?

1093
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:28,999
Some of us are better
at self-regulation.

1094
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:32,500
Having a plan, even if we
don't always follow that plan,

1095
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,208
always helps.

1096
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,792
We don't have to always
follow it.

1097
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,500
- Yes, moderation
in all things,

1098
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,625
including moderation.
- Heather: Right?

1099
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,999
Let's circle back
to where we began,

1100
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:52,583
and we risk giving a plug
to public television, PBS,

1101
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,500
in doing this, and yet,

1102
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,709
it is part of your experience
as an individual

1103
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,000
and as a researcher too.

1104
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,792
What were some of the
milestones, do you think,

1105
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,999
in developing programming

1106
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:07,083
that clearly has a beneficial
effect on children?

1107
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,000
- Yeah, oh, I think one
of the biggest milestones

1108
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,250
is including researchers
and educators in the process.

1109
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,999
So there are some great examples

1110
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:17,667
of content creators
who've worked with educators

1111
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:20,999
and researchers to understand,
study how kids learn

1112
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:23,999
and try to design media
that really works for them.

1113
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:26,999
The earliest and most famous
example is<i>Sesame Street.</i>

1114
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:30,291
So Sesame Workshop
has a team of advisors.

1115
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:32,999
They work with academic advisors
and researchers.

1116
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,999
They do testing and have
researchers on staff

1117
00:44:34,999 --> 00:44:38,166
who study the impact
of the screen time on kids

1118
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,792
and test whether kids
are learning the messages

1119
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:42,875
they're trying to teach them.

1120
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:45,250
- Norman: This would've
been what, in the '60s?

1121
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,583
- Heather: Yeah, late '60s.

1122
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,875
- Norman: Is that still being
done for children's programs?

1123
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,625
There's so much children's
programming out there

1124
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,959
in one medium or another.

1125
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:57,083
How could there be time
for all of these producers

1126
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,999
to run it through, you know,

1127
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,999
child psychologists
or whoever it might be?

1128
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:02,999
- Yeah, and most can't.

1129
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:04,999
It's costly, right,
having folks on staff

1130
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,750
who can test shows, every
single episode, with kids.

1131
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,875
- Well, yeah,
it holds things up.

1132
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,583
- That's exactly right.

1133
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,375
So I think there are
some general principles

1134
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:14,417
that are out there.

1135
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:15,959
I think we can do a lot more

1136
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:16,959
to make those
publicly available.

1137
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:19,417
Like, what has the last 50 years
of research taught us

1138
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,875
about how kids learn well
from video?

1139
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:25,583
Principles that content creators
can follow, for example.

1140
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,417
So I think we can
all do a better job

1141
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:28,999
of trying to get that
information out there,

1142
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:30,542
but I think we've got
enough research now

1143
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:33,792
that we can make those
principles widely available.

1144
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,291
- Which one came first?

1145
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:38,667
<i>Sesame Street</i>orMr. Rogers,

1146
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,750
or for that matter,
<i>The Muppet Show?</i>

1147
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,083
And what approach did
each one of them take?

1148
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,125
- That's a good question.

1149
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:48,333
Oh, goodness, I don't know
the answer to that.

1150
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,083
I know<i>Mr. Rogers
</i> was airing locally

1151
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,875
before I had access to it
where I lived,

1152
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,458
so it might have actually
existed before<i>Sesame Street,</i>

1153
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:56,792
but I didn't get access to it
until later.

1154
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,291
And I watched
<i>The Muppet Show</i>too.

1155
00:45:58,291 --> 00:45:59,959
Gosh, I'm dating myself now too.

1156
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:02,000
But yeah, I did grow up
with all three of these.

1157
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,792
I think all of these groups,
Jim Henson Company,

1158
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:10,709
which had earlier made
<i>The Muppet Show,</i>

1159
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:12,375
Sesame Workshop,
and Fred Rogers Company,

1160
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:16,000
they've all worked
with educators in some way

1161
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,625
or advisors in some way.

1162
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,959
How they use that
and implement it

1163
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:22,999
and what the priority is placed
on educational goals

1164
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:26,041
versus entertainment goals,
that balance is different

1165
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,834
for each of these
content creators.

1166
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:30,667
And entertainment
isn't necessarily

1167
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:34,709
a bad outcome either,
but I think that different folks

1168
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,041
are going to prioritize
those things differently.

1169
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,999
- I'm just trying to think of,
you know, specific scenes.

1170
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:41,959
And of course there's so many,

1171
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:45,999
and I was not, let's say,
in the right demographic

1172
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:48,999
to get those programs
on the first wave.

1173
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,583
And even the second wave
was only in passing.

1174
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:55,500
But I'm thinking, for example,
of Kermit the Frog,

1175
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,834
and he sings the song
"It's Not Easy Being Green,"

1176
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:02,834
which any number of children

1177
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:08,083
for any number of reasons
could empathize with.

1178
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:10,333
- Heather: Yep, that's right.

1179
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,166
- And so there must be
myriad examples,

1180
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,458
but let's go back over
to Fred Rogers

1181
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,166
and what was the
format of that show,

1182
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,500
and why was it so effective?

1183
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,999
- Heather: Yeah,
one of the things

1184
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:21,999
the show's really famous for,

1185
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:24,999
at least in my world, is
breaking the fourth wall, right?

1186
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:26,792
So he spoke directly to me

1187
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,750
as a young child
in my living room.

1188
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,417
That was not common
for a grown man

1189
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:33,542
to make eye-to-eye contact
with a young child

1190
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:36,333
and tell them that
they're important

1191
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,041
and their feelings matter.

1192
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,875
I mean, it was really quite
profound in a couple of ways.

1193
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,375
But just the act
of breaking the fourth wall

1194
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:45,250
and talking directly to the
audience is really unique.

1195
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,250
And more shows do that now,

1196
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,250
and there's a growing body
of research on that

1197
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:53,208
and how that might help kids
learn better or engage better.

1198
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:54,999
So talking directly
to the child,

1199
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,750
but also, Fred Rogers
was really innovative

1200
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,999
and really focusing
on the social-emotional world

1201
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:01,625
of young children,

1202
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:06,166
and really holding that up and
making that really important.

1203
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,458
- I've heard some criticism

1204
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,375
thatMister Rogers'
 Neighborhood

1205
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,041
may have gone too far

1206
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,834
in kind of exalting, putting
the child on a pedestal

1207
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:22,750
and giving them the sense
or giving them the implication

1208
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,417
that they were the center
of the world

1209
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,583
and it should move around them.

1210
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,000
Have you run into any of that?

1211
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,999
- I'm aware of this concern.
[both laugh]

1212
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:32,917
I've heard it in lots
of different ways,

1213
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:34,291
not just about Fred Rogers.

1214
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,542
Yeah, this is another case

1215
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:39,125
where I think reasonable people
will disagree about,

1216
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,999
and I understand
both sides of this.

1217
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:44,999
But it's hard for me to imagine
there is a whole generation

1218
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:47,500
of kids running around
with enormous egos

1219
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,875
because Fred Rogers
said, "You are special."

1220
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:52,999
It's hard to imagine TV has
that great of an impact on kids

1221
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:56,375
and the rest of the world
didn't put us back in our place.

1222
00:48:56,375 --> 00:49:00,250
But it's possible there's
a good balance to strike there

1223
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,959
and that more research
can be done

1224
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:04,417
to find out what the
right balance is.

1225
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:06,999
- And as far as...

1226
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:10,583
Oh, well, I have to go back
in time now,

1227
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:12,999
and I don't know if you've
ever run across this or not,

1228
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:17,999
but it's gonna play right
into our neighborhood here

1229
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:19,834
at PBS Wisconsin.

1230
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:21,999
There was a show
many, many years ago

1231
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:23,542
called<i>The Friendly Giant.</i>

1232
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:26,291
Have you ever run across that?
- Heather: I've heard of it.

1233
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,542
I don't think I've seen it,
yeah.

1234
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,250
- Norman: I think you could
probably still get

1235
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,999
the occasional, you know,
YouTube clip out of it.

1236
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:36,999
But that first word there
in the title,

1237
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:39,208
<i>The Friendly Giant.</i>

1238
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,875
And, of course, traditionally,

1239
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,625
children would be afraid
of a giant,

1240
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,417
you know,<i>Jack and the Beanstalk
</i> and fee-fi-fo-fum,

1241
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:46,208
and all that kind of thing.

1242
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:51,625
But this was a friendly giant,
and he had all kinds of friends.

1243
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:55,417
Jerome the Giraffe
that he would interview

1244
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:56,166
from time to time.

1245
00:49:56,166 --> 00:50:01,291
It was, I believe it was
live television,

1246
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:01,999
then recorded.

1247
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,125
But in any event, if there
was a glitch in there,

1248
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:09,166
they would work with it,
incorporate it into the show,

1249
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,792
which made it even funnier.

1250
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:15,291
And so, you know, credit
goes to PBS Wisconsin for it,

1251
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:21,041
and we're talking about now,
late '50s, early '60s, I think,

1252
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:21,999
for that show.

1253
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:24,999
And so it has been with us
in one form or another,

1254
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:27,999
but I think,
what would you say then

1255
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:30,208
would be the principles
behind that?

1256
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,667
I mean, the concept
of friendliness,

1257
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:33,750
concept of neighborhood,

1258
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,417
and we haven't really talked
about<i>Sesame Street</i>either.

1259
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:38,999
- Yeah, I mean,<i>Sesame Street</i>

1260
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:42,291
is sort of an entity
unto its own

1261
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:44,542
because of its longevity, right?

1262
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,375
The longest-running show
for young kids.

1263
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:48,250
The amount of resources

1264
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,500
that go into testing
every episode with kids,

1265
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,125
so it's having their own
research team.

1266
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,250
It's unlike any other
content creation process

1267
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,999
that I know of.

1268
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:00,417
It's been the recipient
of both the greatest praise

1269
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:01,709
and harshest criticism.
- Has it?

1270
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,750
- Because it's been
the longest running.

1271
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,583
- Oh, okay.

1272
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,041
What have the criticisms been?

1273
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,999
- Well, I think decades ago,

1274
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,041
when the field of research
around kids

1275
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:11,083
and screens was really emerging,

1276
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:14,917
there was a lot of criticism
around the pacing of television

1277
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,250
and concerns about...

1278
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,834
And these are concerns
that have been raised

1279
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:21,875
for every new technology,
novels, and radio programs,

1280
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,125
and comic books
and all the things,

1281
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,417
and video games after it.

1282
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,375
But the same concerns

1283
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,999
and hopes have emerged
for all of these things.

1284
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:31,166
So worried that it's going
to make kids worse in school

1285
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:32,834
because they're spending
less time reading

1286
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:34,834
or worries about it
shortening attention spans.

1287
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:37,875
All kinds of things.
- May be too good in a way.

1288
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:38,333
- Mm-hmm, right.

1289
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,083
If you prefer<i>Sesame Street
</i>over first grade,

1290
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:43,417
that's a problem.
- That would be a problem.

1291
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,375
<i>Sesame Street,</i>though,

1292
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:53,999
certainly was devoted
to inclusiveness though.

1293
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,166
- Heather: That's right.

1294
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,999
They always have been,
and they continue to be,

1295
00:51:56,999 --> 00:52:00,959
and they continue to have
concrete curriculum goals

1296
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:01,792
around inclusion.

1297
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:05,999
- Norman: And also a lot
of bilingual learning.

1298
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:06,875
- Yep, yep.

1299
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,208
So having bilingual characters,

1300
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,875
characters who are
fully bilingual

1301
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:11,625
to an increasing degree,

1302
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:14,125
representing different racial
and ethnic subgroups,

1303
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:18,542
representing diversity
across multiple dimensions.

1304
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:21,750
- And even with Big Bird,

1305
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,917
dealing in one notable episode
with death.

1306
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:26,542
- That's right, yep.

1307
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:30,375
They've never shied away
from difficult topics,

1308
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,125
and I think they've considered
themselves champions

1309
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:34,999
in this world, that they think
TV can be a powerful tool

1310
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:37,125
for tackling difficult concepts.

1311
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,999
After the attacks
on September 11 in 2001,

1312
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:41,083
they had a series of episodes

1313
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:44,500
that were tackling hate
and bias.

1314
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,999
They had episodes
tackling death and dying,

1315
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,875
all kinds of things, yep.

1316
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,458
- We haven't, with the time
left, we could get, I think,

1317
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,500
briefly into the whole concept
of G-rated movies.

1318
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,999
We haven't really talked
about going to the theater.

1319
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:00,999
Do people still do that?

1320
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:03,917
Last I heard they did,
but tomorrow may be another day.

1321
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:08,542
But G-rated films, do you
have an approach to those?

1322
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,417
Do you have some that stand out?

1323
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:14,375
- Yeah, I think the way
that those are gone about,

1324
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:15,417
the way that they're created

1325
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:16,375
tends to be really different
from TV,

1326
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,542
at least certain shows that are
really targeting young kids.

1327
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,333
The focus is much more
on the story

1328
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,959
and entertainment as opposed
to educational value.

1329
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:27,583
But there are certainly ones
that have positive themes.

1330
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:29,083
- This concept
of the fourth wall

1331
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:32,959
has come up from time to time
in our conversation.

1332
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,458
And can the fourth wall,

1333
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:39,542
intimate and direct
as it may be in video,

1334
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:43,583
ever be as effective
a learning device

1335
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:47,250
as just a real-life
3D conversation?

1336
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,208
- There's actually
a lot of research on this.

1337
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:51,041
It's really interesting.

1338
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,667
So there's what we call
the video deficit effect.

1339
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,834
So young kids learn less
from screens

1340
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:57,834
than real-life demonstrations,

1341
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,125
even if that video
is someone looking at them

1342
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,999
and talking to them like you
are talking to me right now.

1343
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:07,041
So young kids will learn less
from the video version of that

1344
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:07,999
than a real-life version

1345
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,458
of sitting right in front
of the person,

1346
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,999
even if everything else
is exactly the same.

1347
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,125
And early research suggests
it's around two and a half

1348
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,792
or three years old that
kids start to learn as well

1349
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:19,458
from the video version
as the real-life version.

1350
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,999
So if I'm looking
through a window at something

1351
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:24,000
versus the TV screen
at something,

1352
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,959
I'll learn equally well.

1353
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,792
That's around two and a half
or three years old.

1354
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,792
When the task is more difficult,
that age creeps up and up.

1355
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:31,333
So there might be
a video deficit

1356
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,333
throughout the whole lifespan

1357
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,999
if we have difficult enough
concepts.

1358
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:39,667
- What would you like to see
next in a children's video

1359
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,875
or a show that you haven't seen?

1360
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:45,625
What would be just
the thing for you?

1361
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,333
- The thing I would love,
oh, goodness.

1362
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:50,208
Oh, that's a tough one;
I haven't thought about this.

1363
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,625
Something I'd love to see
in kids' TV.

1364
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:56,250
I would love to see
a comeback to shows

1365
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,875
that break the fourth wall
with the right timing

1366
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,999
for young kids to engage.

1367
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:01,709
I think a lot of shows
break the fourth wall

1368
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:04,999
and talk to kids, but there are
some earlier shows in that world

1369
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:05,834
that had the right pause

1370
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:07,166
so that young kids could
take time, reflect,

1371
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:10,166
and really engage and respond,
and now we've got the technology

1372
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:13,166
to make it responsive back to
the kids and adaptive to them.

1373
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,999
I'm really curious to see
what happens there.

1374
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:16,625
- I'm trying to remember
if Captain Kangaroo

1375
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,999
broke the fourth wall
back in his day or not.

1376
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:20,625
- I don't remember.

1377
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:22,667
Yeah, he talked to his audience
a lot, I guess,

1378
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,542
his live audience.
- Yes, well, and, of course,

1379
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:25,999
the fourth wall
is a great technique too.

1380
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:28,125
I mean, it worked
for<i>The Office,</i>and it was like,

1381
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,542
oh, suddenly it was seemed
like something very new.

1382
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:31,166
And yet, of course,

1383
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:33,125
it goes all the way back
to Shakespeare and before.

1384
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,999
- Right, that's right.
- Very effective with the--

1385
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,208
- It's a good device, yeah.
- Yeah, the person on stage

1386
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:42,500
or on screen talking directly
