1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,270
- Merrilee Lee: Good evening,

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,305
and welcome to
the Hoard Historical Museum.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,774
I'm Marilee Lee,
the director of the museum,

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,512
and we are thrilled to host both
Caryl Pagel and PBS Wisconsin

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,780
for this program
on Lorine Niedecker.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,717
As someone who lives in
Fort Atkinson like Lorine did,

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,786
it is always inspiring to be
reminded of Lorine's legacy

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,289
not just here,
but in a far wider area

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,790
than our city's limits.

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,759
So, Caryl, thank you
for reminding us

11
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,828
of Lorine's importance
to all of us.

12
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,930
And it's my honor
to introduce Nick Gulig,

13
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,332
our current poet laureate
of Wisconsin.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,635
Nick is a professor
at UW-Whitewater,

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,004
and besides also
being inspired by Lorine,

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,239
he is a poet who lives
in Fort Atkinson.

17
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,908
Which makes me think
there might be something

18
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,976
in Fort Atkinson's water
that creates poets.

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,179
[audience laughing]
And on that note, Nick,

20
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,047
I'll turn this over to you.

21
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,349
[audience applauding]

22
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,125
- Nicholas Gulig: In the
footsteps of Lorine Niedecker,

23
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,595
Caryl Pagel set out
around Lake Superior,

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,464
following with her young son
as best she can,

25
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:09,703
a trip previously taken in 1966
at the end of her life

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,241
by Lorine Niedecker,
Wisconsin's most notable poet.

27
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,512
Quote, "not replicating her path
around the lake exactly,

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,481
"but wandering
with hope and openness

29
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,450
to see what Niedecker saw."

30
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:27,354
She writes,
"Every day is an intimacy.

31
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,225
"How close can we step
before silhouettes touch?

32
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,629
How much can the shade
of two shadows overlap?"

33
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,099
To me,
these questions feel rooted

34
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:44,204
not in the anxiety of influence,
but in gratitude for it.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,973
Her trip around the lake,

36
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,277
a form of active recognition
of seeing clearly

37
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:55,716
the lines connecting her to
those who came and wrote before.

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,951
I love these lines of inquiry

39
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,487
because they celebrate
and credit,

40
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,357
pay tribute, and give thanks.

41
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:08,128
At their core, these gestures
remind us we are not alone.

42
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:12,599
That language is a communal act
in which the living and the dead

43
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,301
accept each other,

44
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:19,373
work together, speak to
and through and of each other.

45
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:24,845
If this is true, it means
that no one is an island.

46
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:28,348
We demand, define,
and are defined ourselves

47
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,818
by the living vibrancy
of our relations,

48
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,122
the little intimacies
too easily forgotten,

49
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,060
too often forfeited upon the
solitary altar of the self.

50
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:45,199
In addition to being a writer,
Caryl is also an educator,

51
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,602
an associate professor
at Cleveland State University,

52
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,772
and an editor and publisher
running Rescue Press,

53
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,141
which she founded in Milwaukee,

54
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,111
as well as the Cleveland
State University Poetry Center.

55
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,681
In this way,
Caryl's shadow overlaps with

56
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,051
and helps to form the community
of which countless students

57
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,255
and other writers are a part,
myself included.

58
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:14,328
Born in Iowa, raised
in Wisconsin and Illinois,

59
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:18,298
Caryl Pagel holds a BA from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison

60
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,835
and MFAs from the School
of the Art Institute of Chicago

61
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,304
and the Iowa Writers' Workshop.

62
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,473
She has taught creative writing,
literature,

63
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,876
composition,
and humanities courses

64
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,611
at the University of Iowa,

65
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,579
the University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,

66
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,314
Carthage College,

67
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,583
Milwaukee Institute
of Art and Design,

68
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,786
and Columbia College Chicago.

69
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,089
The author of three books
of poetry,

70
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,858
a collection of essays,
and three chapbooks,

71
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,628
her writing has appeared
in some of the most important

72
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,964
and influential journals
in the country.

73
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,434
Currently, Caryl is working
on a book-length essay

74
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,069
about Lorine Niedecker

75
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,705
and her relationship
to regional politics,

76
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,475
the Great Lakes,
small press publishing,

77
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,443
humor, and reading.

78
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:07,915
It is my honor to introduce
and welcome to Fort Atkinson,

79
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,550
my friend Caryl Pagel.

80
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,852
[audience applauding]

81
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,465
- Caryl Pagel: Thank you so much
for that, Nick.

82
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,301
That was beautiful.

83
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,804
I'll just, you know,
echo some of your sentiments

84
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,207
and say that one
of the great gifts

85
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,742
of thinking about Niedecker

86
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,744
and writing about her
these last couple of years

87
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,414
has been getting
to collaborate with Nick.

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,984
So that's really beautiful,
thank you.

89
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,054
Okay, so I'm here tonight
to talk about

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,291
the 20th century
American poet Lorine Niedecker,

91
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,293
who some of you know
is from Wisconsin

92
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,864
and grew up and lived just a
couple of miles away from here

93
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,932
in Black Hawk Island.

94
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,970
And as just a little bit
of an intro, a couple of notes.

95
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,372
I've divided my talk up
into sections,

96
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,207
and they're matched with photos

97
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,809
with a slideshow here
that you're gonna see,

98
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,211
and there are slides
of her books

99
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,380
and some of the places
that she visited.

100
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,649
There's a couple in there
from the trips

101
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,385
that Nick was talking about.

102
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,989
And then also a bunch
of archival photos.

103
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,259
And for that, I want to thank
the Hoard Historical Museum,

104
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,463
specifically Merrilee Lee,
who helped me figure those out,

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,698
and the Friends of Niedecker
group.

106
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,001
And I'll also just thank

107
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,205
and give a shout out
to the Friends of Niedecker.

108
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,707
You know, a local group
who has done so much work

109
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,476
in the last couple of decades,

110
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:46,213
getting Niedecker's work
and her poetry

111
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,582
out into the community
and the world.

112
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,584
And if you're interested,

113
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,586
I'll talk about this
a little bit at the end.

114
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:53,921
But if you're interested
in Niedecker

115
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,923
and you don't know a lot
about her after tonight,

116
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,958
a good place to start
is on their website,

117
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,261
where they have a bunch
of resources and lists

118
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:06,667
of really incredible information
and writing about her.

119
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,772
One.

120
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:16,910
Lorine Faith Niedecker
was born on May 12, 1903,

121
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,580
in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.

122
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,015
A Taurus and earth sign,

123
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,550
she arrived
in what's frequently

124
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,754
the first real week of spring
in the Midwest.

125
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,058
Niedecker's parents
were Theresa Daisy Kunz,

126
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,793
or "Beanpole" to her,

127
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,662
a reference
to Daisy's slender height,

128
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,665
and Henry Niedecker,
a commercial fisherman

129
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,168
who managed their property
on Black Hawk Island,

130
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:45,138
renting cabins
to hunters and fishermen.

131
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,976
Henry teaches Lorine to fish
and boat.

132
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,312
He's a drinker, a joker,
a man about town,

133
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,549
and a poor,
if earnest businessman.

134
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,085
Daisy cleans all the time.

135
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,489
She gradually loses her hearing
throughout Lorine's childhood

136
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,159
and becomes
increasingly secluded.

137
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:09,429
The Niedeckers live
at the end of the peninsula

138
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,065
where Rock River meets
Lake Koshkonong,

139
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,303
punctuated by Mud Lake,
more of a large pond.

140
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,175
A frequently flooding swamp
and soggy land to live on.

141
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:25,512
She's an only child, raised on
a seasonally inhabited peninsula

142
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,182
where the river
regularly floods.

143
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,585
Their world,
damp and wet and muddy.

144
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,690
Lorine occasionally stays
with relatives or friends

145
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,693
in Fort Atkinson,
four miles away,

146
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,764
so she can make it to school
when the weather is bad.

147
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,001
Lorine's a quiet kid
with a handful of school friends

148
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,338
and glasses
specially made for her.

149
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,540
Here's Lorine in a bow,

150
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,710
Lorine playing leapfrog,

151
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,579
Lorine, age 9 or 10,

152
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,648
with tall Daisy
perched side by side

153
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,651
on a barn bench
looking into the distance,

154
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,521
sans smiles, sharp profiles.

155
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:12,059
Lorine, that same age,
sitting in Henry's lap,

156
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,162
peering up at him
and arm around his neck.

157
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,897
It's 1912.

158
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:19,700
In a future slide,

159
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,768
you'll see a photo of Lorine
in her 20s

160
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,505
with a group
of fun-looking girls.

161
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,307
She wears pants
and more functional,

162
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,643
less gendered outfits
in her youth,

163
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,612
and then for a while after that,

164
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,848
mostly dresses,
at least in photos,

165
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:39,052
post-war fashion seeming
to move backward.

166
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,190
There are pictures of Lorine
and her someday husband Al,

167
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,026
showing her small
and delicate posture

168
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,562
in contrast to his height,

169
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:53,300
his disabled arm often tucked
down or behind her back,

170
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,936
away from the camera's eye.

171
00:08:56,303 --> 00:09:01,008
Soon you'll see her
iconic Harlequin cat eye glasses

172
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,076
and short curly hair.

173
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,246
Niedecker's very blonde
her whole life.

174
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,883
Then a bit of gray,
I don't know if dyed.

175
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,720
She has a nice smile,
bright eyes.

176
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,891
In one photo,
Niedecker's mock stepping out

177
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,496
of the new Black Hawk house
she builds with Al in the 1960s.

178
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,032
Built high
as a continued response

179
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,434
to the promise of floods.

180
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,872
In one, she's in her neighbor
Gail Roub's director's chair

181
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,541
perched in front of the river.

182
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,210
Lorine tells Gail

183
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,980
she desires a single image
or two to represent her,

184
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,250
like Dickinson or Willa Cather.

185
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,585
But it's too late.

186
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,554
She's alive in a visual world.

187
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,456
My favorite is a photo

188
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,625
that you'll see right
at the end

189
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,328
of Niedecker,
standing off center

190
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,331
and to the side of Julie,
her stepdaughter,

191
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,601
and Al later in life
in their yard,

192
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,903
taking a picture
of the photographer

193
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,205
taking a picture of her.

194
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,176
Today, you'll see some of the
existing pictures of Niedecker,

195
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,878
courtesy of the Hoard,

196
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,647
but there are many more
from Lorine's point of view.

197
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,384
She made travel books,
scrapbooks, collages.

198
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,988
Many of her remaining photos
weren't of people at all

199
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,756
but the natural world,

200
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,893
glimpses she caught of the land
and the light

201
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,762
and the grass and the animals.

202
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:35,369
Niedecker's nearsighted,
has trouble with her eyes,

203
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,271
is always noting
what she's missed

204
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,540
by not quite seeing it.

205
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,775
She looks away for an instant,

206
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,111
the wrong way
at the right time,

207
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,380
sometimes standing
in front of something

208
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,849
when she should have
spun around.

209
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,653
Her poems,
so often about seeing landscape

210
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,454
and the particulars of place,

211
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,659
are flooded with precise
but incomplete visions,

212
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:03,297
often focusing on one detail
instead of every detail,

213
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,867
the compelling uncertainty
of looking.

214
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:12,406
Her sly, knowing inability
to absorb the entire panorama.

215
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,042
Many lines
of Niedecker's poetry

216
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,846
note a failure to clock
what she knew was there.

217
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,516
The clarity
of one physical sense operating

218
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,518
as contrast to another.

219
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,520
Her inability to see well,

220
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:30,557
making other mysteries
more transparent.

221
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,193
In an early poem, she jokes,

222
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,030
"A student,
my head always down

223
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,167
"of the grass as I mow.

224
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,236
I missed the cranes."

225
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:47,374
And in her later, longer poem,
"Lake Superior,"

226
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,443
a section of it reads,

227
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,380
"I'm sorry to have missed
Sand Lake.

228
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,049
"My dear one tells me
we did not.

229
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,519
We watched a gopher there."

230
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,323
Four.

231
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,862
As a girl, Niedecker writes,
reads, plays music,

232
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,133
helps her mom around the house,
watches the rivers work.

233
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,769
As a teen,
she reads <i>Ethan Frome,</i>

234
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,437
<i>Political Philosophy,</i>

235
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,374
and <i>Land Birds</i>
<i>East of the Rockies.</i>

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,809
She contributes poems
to the yearbook

237
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:26,547
and makes a name for herself
in debate club.

238
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,883
In 1922, Niedecker attends
Beloit College,

239
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,655
which many of you know,
about 45 minutes south of here.

240
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,491
She writes and reads
and studies music,

241
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:40,694
one day going to a guest lecture
by Harriet Monroe,

242
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,165
the founding editor
of Chicago's <i>Poetry Magazine.</i>

243
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:49,469
One can imagine how exciting
a talk like this must have been.

244
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:54,241
Niedecker witnessing firsthand
a powerful Midwestern woman

245
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:58,212
who founded and ran a nationally
famous literary journal,

246
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,281
speak about her life and poetry.

247
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,719
One can imagine the effects
this kind of representation,

248
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,322
even briefly,
could have on a curious,

249
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,858
book-loving young woman.

250
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:15,996
Unfortunately, shortly after,
things back in Black Hawk change

251
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,664
and Niedecker
has to leave college

252
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,000
after her sophomore year.

253
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,036
Henry's running out of money
and Daisy is ill,

254
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,805
so she goes home.

255
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,542
The decade
between dropping out of college

256
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,577
when she is in her early 20s

257
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:36,049
and then when we know her as a
published poet in her early 30s,

258
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,118
is the time in her adult life

259
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,955
in which we have
the fewest primary sources.

260
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,324
The letters from this period
no longer exist,

261
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,193
and any journal
she might have had

262
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,995
were destroyed upon her death.

263
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,664
But we do know some things.

264
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,200
Niedecker is back in Black Hawk.

265
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:58,071
Her father is the cause of some
mess, both social and financial.

266
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,406
He's been having an affair

267
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,975
with the Niedecker's younger
next-door neighbor,

268
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,779
which is what supposedly leads
him to slowly offload parcels

269
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,648
of their property cheaply

270
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,617
to appease
his mistress's husband.

271
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,887
Daisy is distant
and not doing well.

272
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:17,658
Home again, Lorine writes,
while Daisy washes.

273
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,594
Does Lorine mope
at this turn of events?

274
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,596
There's no proof of it.

275
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,898
She's removed
from her college friends,

276
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,301
her clubs, her syllabus.

277
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,636
What seems possible,

278
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,273
she must be wondering,
"What's next?"

279
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,776
In 1928,

280
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:39,346
Niedecker starts working at the
Dwight Foster Public Library,

281
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,282
also just down the street
from here.

282
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,785
The same year,
after a short courtship,

283
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:48,655
she marries Frank Hartwig,
someone her father knows

284
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,625
and the brother
of a childhood friend.

285
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,361
Lorine and Frank
are together only briefly

286
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,530
before they separate.

287
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,966
Scholars have guessed
at the reason--

288
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:04,605
job loss, sex life, the economy,
boredom, the usual things.

289
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,807
We don't know,
but in any case,

290
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:10,777
she doesn't become a wife
in the style of her mother.

291
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,646
She wants to write.

292
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,650
In 1930,
she's laid off from the library.

293
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,325
Five.

294
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,128
Right around this time,

295
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:31,198
Ezra Pound asks
his friend Harriet Monroe,

296
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,101
the previously mentioned
editor of <i>Poetry,</i>

297
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,036
if a young writer he knows,

298
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:40,474
Louis Zukofsky, can carry
an issue of the magazine.

299
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,010
Monroe agrees,
encouraging Zukofsky,

300
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,481
who Pound sees as an inheritor
of Modernist and Imagist values,

301
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:50,551
to invent a name for the group
of friends he collects.

302
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:55,189
And so Zukofsky introduces
the Objectivists:

303
00:15:55,255 --> 00:16:01,028
Kenneth Rexroth, Carl Rakosi,
George Oppen, Basil Bunting,

304
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,665
and Charles Reznikoff,
among others.

305
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:08,602
The Objectivist priorities,
though loosely defined,

306
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,772
include a concentration
on particulars,

307
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,975
a focus on material conditions.

308
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,644
One might say
it's a Depression-era,

309
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,581
Marxist-influenced,
male-centric,

310
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,716
cool view, minimalist,

311
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,720
logical, fact-based approach
to writing poetry,

312
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,256
including values pulled
from Modernism,

313
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,758
values that all show up
again later

314
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:36,096
in documentary language
and ecopoetic traditions.

315
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,600
An Objectivist poem draws
meaning from speech and music,

316
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,770
tools to be used
for calibration and precision.

317
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,472
Niedecker,
who's later called

318
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,275
the "truest" Objectivist poet
by Rakosi,

319
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,811
was later associated
or affiliated

320
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,247
or adjunct to this group
via friendship

321
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,915
and a similar poetics,

322
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:56,683
though she wasn't
very meaningfully

323
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,352
or publicly acknowledged

324
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,488
as being a part of it
while it was happening.

325
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,457
But she doesn't know
any of this.

326
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:08,328
When she picks up the
February 1931 issue of <i>Poetry,</i>

327
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,731
she's 28,

328
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:15,335
an unemployed college dropout
estranged from a hardly husband

329
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,172
with a complicated family
and few friends

330
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:22,543
she can talk to about
what's most important to her.

331
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,946
In 1931,
a gallon of milk is 26 cents.

332
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:29,116
Hoover's president.

333
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:32,085
America's three years
into the Great Depression,

334
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:36,156
the average national wage
is $1,850 a year,

335
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,861
though a librarian
probably made less than that.

336
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,363
The following year, in 1932,

337
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,300
UW economics professors
would form the first

338
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,703
unemployment compensation
program in America

339
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,239
right there in Wisconsin.

340
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,609
But in 1931, Lorine is reading.

341
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:59,413
Lorine's on the brink
of a new life.

342
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,381
The magazine introduces

343
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,750
a freshly grouped
coterie of poets,

344
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,886
presented against the mainstream

345
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,655
for the first time
as a unified force

346
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:11,291
by a writer who,
though from New York,

347
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:15,495
recently taught not far
from her in Madison.

348
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,031
So what does Niedecker do?

349
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:23,737
She writes a letter to Zukofsky
and he reciprocates the gesture.

350
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:27,341
This is young Zukofsky.
[chuckling]

351
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,109
Six.

352
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,111
Niedecker's letter
begins a correspondence

353
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,914
that will last nearly 40 years.

354
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,682
On Zukofsky's suggestion,

355
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,885
she sends poems
to Harriet Monroe,

356
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,789
which are published
a few years later in <i>Poetry.</i>

357
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,526
They write to each other
for about two years

358
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,629
before he invites her
to visit in New York.

359
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:52,232
Henry helps her purchase a train
ticket against Daisy's wishes,

360
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,170
and Lorine packs a bag,
showing up in Brooklyn.

361
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,337
When she arrives,

362
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,239
Lorine and Louis
become a couple,

363
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,041
and though
there's little information

364
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,843
about this time
in New York,

365
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,078
Lorine is described
by Mary Oppen,

366
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,216
wife of George Oppen,
the poet, as reserved,

367
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,851
once showing up late to a dinner

368
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:16,356
because she was too shy to ask
for directions on the subway.

369
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,726
Lorine and Louis write,
talk about literature,

370
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,095
hang out with poet friends.

371
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:26,166
Eventually, she gets pregnant
and has an abortion,

372
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:31,004
shortly after which
Niedecker returns to Wisconsin.

373
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,608
Who knows how Lorine felt
about any of this?

374
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,977
But by five or so years later,

375
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:39,346
when their surviving
letters begin,

376
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,616
Niedecker and Zukofsky
are still friends.

377
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,820
Her time in New York,
one could maybe say, is evidence

378
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:51,658
of a willingness to take
risks for love and for poetry.

379
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,995
A few years later,
Zukofsky marries Celia Thaew,

380
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:58,332
a composer and musician
he meets in New York.

381
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:02,135
They have a kid, who Lorine
knows and adores from afar,

382
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,440
the someday famous violinist
Paul Zukofsky.

383
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,676
Niedecker and Zukofsky write
to each other

384
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,845
consistently,
sometimes weekly,

385
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,082
over the ensuing four decades
about poetry,

386
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,385
their lives, money,
the weather, the reading,

387
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,754
what's on their minds.

388
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,390
From the time Lorine
first reaches out,

389
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:26,727
they're best friends of a kind,
and it's worth noting

390
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:30,230
that the longest literary
friendship of her life began

391
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:33,100
because of the reader
she was.

392
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,171
"Her primary devotion
was not to a man,"

393
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,374
writes the poet scholar
Rachel Blau DuPlessis,

394
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,975
"but to her writing."

395
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:46,713
And Zukofsky helped
confirm her in this vocation.

396
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:51,451
Seven.

397
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,424
From 1938 to 1942,
by then in her late 30s,

398
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,229
Niedecker works for the Federal
Writers Project in Madison,

399
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,600
helping edit and organize
the WPA's Guide to Wisconsin.

400
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,069
The Works Progress
Administration's writers,

401
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:12,239
tasked by Congress
to hold up a mirror to America

402
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,843
and describe the life and people
of a whole nation,

403
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,278
employed
more than 8 million people.

404
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:22,683
Though in 1938, only
a little over 13% were women.

405
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,418
It's during this time,

406
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,753
while her day job requires
a significant amount

407
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,622
of research and editing,

408
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,657
that Niedecker is also working
on the poems

409
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:34,995
that will become her first book,
<i>New Goose.</i>

410
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:39,199
Niedecker will come to refer to
these early poems as folk poems,

411
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:43,036
often arising from or
referring to the speech or talk

412
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:47,040
of neighbors or colleagues
or strangers.

413
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,209
She's working
with the oral histories

414
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,245
and interviews in Madison,

415
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,714
helping put together
a travel guide based in part

416
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,149
on synthesizing
the cultural knowledge

417
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,719
of the Wisconsin public.

418
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:02,856
Her poetics mirror
these gestures: the interactive,

419
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:06,126
the natural, the historical,
the social.

420
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:11,999
<i>New Goose,</i> including slight
smart slices of the commons.

421
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,734
Here's one.

422
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:19,640
"For sun and moon and radio,
farmers pay dearly.

423
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:24,511
Their natural resource:
turn the world off early."

424
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,148
Though it isn't published
until 1946,

425
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:31,919
<i>New Goose</i> is Niedecker's
Depression-era collection,

426
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:36,023
much of it touching
on economics, small-town gossip,

427
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,991
and rural survival,

428
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:42,296
about what people do
to get through.

429
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,899
They're socialist-influenced
critiques of the nation

430
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:49,803
as its citizens are struggling
through war and unemployment.

431
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,538
Here's another.

432
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:56,910
"I doubt I'll get silk stockings
out of my asparagus

433
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:59,479
"that grows too fast
to stop it,

434
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:03,383
or any pair of capitals,
miracles of profit."

435
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:08,922
<i>New Goose</i> is additionally
made of language overheard.

436
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:11,625
One poem is about a neighbor,
a boss,

437
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,794
a girlfriend of hers
getting married,

438
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,063
folk poems aiming
for the political,

439
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,832
the energetic, the insightful.

440
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,767
<i>New Goose,</i>
the title also, of course,

441
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:25,005
refers to children's verse,
Mother Goose, common rhymes,

442
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,342
her own heavy sonic play
often complicating

443
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,878
the threat of the content.

444
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,381
Eight.

445
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,585
She's funny.

446
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:40,888
She knows she's funny.

447
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:43,223
Funny people usually do.

448
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,959
When you're funny,
it's what you live for.

449
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:49,096
Little jokes with her
late-in-life husband Al

450
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,965
typed up and given to his kids
for Christmas,

451
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:55,135
witticisms,
her letters always in jest,

452
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:58,539
self-deprecating humility
with a wink,

453
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,208
making the heavier themes
in her work buoyant

454
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:04,178
with some unexpected twist.

455
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:06,813
Maybe a quick shift in tone.

456
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:09,516
The music of a line causing song

457
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,586
where there wouldn't
usually be one.

458
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,621
All that talk in her head.

459
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:18,158
Scraps of hearsay,
dialect, gossip,

460
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:21,295
word-for-word
some rant of her mother's.

461
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,697
Sometimes a quote carries
the thought.

462
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:27,467
Shards of dialogue
lifted from the day to frame.

463
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,804
A piece will begin like
the start of some radio gag.

464
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:33,473
One joker turning to another.

465
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,209
Like this:

466
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:38,745
"There was a bridge
once that said, 'I'm going.'

467
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,048
"And a cistern that said,
'What ho?'

468
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,383
"And the stick said,
lying on the ground,

469
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,252
'How am I to grow?'"

470
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,623
The voices of others
ignite her writing,

471
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,026
and it's startling to come
across such vibrant speech

472
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:56,029
surrounded by dense,
minimalist phrasing

473
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:58,632
and the gravitas
of a page's blank.

474
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:01,835
Small poems,
lush, wide margins.

475
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,773
A prank or pun packed in
by all that nothing.

476
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,177
A match struck at midnight.

477
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:11,912
A one-woman riot.

478
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,717
Here's another of my
favorite funny ones.

479
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:20,954
"Mr. Van Ess bought
14 washcloths?

480
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,659
"Fourteen wash rags, Ed Van Ess?

481
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:28,729
"Must be going to give 'em
to the church, I guess.

482
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,264
"He drinks, you know.

483
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,899
"The day we moved,

484
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,134
"he came into the kitchen,
stewed,

485
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,803
"mixed things up
for my sister Grace.

486
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,107
Put the spices
in the wrong place."

487
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:44,278
She's full of jokes
in her letters,

488
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:47,247
pet names and puns
and regional phrases.

489
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,249
A one of a kind goofball.

490
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,852
High spirits, even when down.

491
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,888
She likes, I think,
to imagine a laugh.

492
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:57,858
In her letters, she complains
about her life sometimes,

493
00:25:57,925 --> 00:26:00,093
but nearly always with a grin.

494
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,398
A turn of phrase to erase
or change critique to music

495
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,133
after saying it.

496
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,370
Nine.

497
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,675
When the WPA work ends,

498
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,378
Niedecker briefly works for the
radio station in Madison,

499
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:22,449
returning home to Black Hawk
again in 1942.

500
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:26,720
Though Henry owns
and manages the Black Hawk land,

501
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:28,789
it was actually
Kunz family property

502
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,490
gifted through marriage.

503
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:35,295
First purchased by Daisy's
great-grandmother in 1863,

504
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,732
15 years after Wisconsin
acquired statehood,

505
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,936
and only 30 or so
after the Black Hawk War.

506
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:45,939
This land, the land
where we now stand,

507
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,643
was once occupied by Ho-Chunk
and Menominee tribes.

508
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,045
Though Black Hawk Island
and Fort Atkinson

509
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,449
are named for 1832's
Black Hawk War,

510
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:58,585
which began on the occasion
of Sauk, Fox,

511
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,655
and Kickapoo tribes
attempting to return

512
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,758
to farm ancestral lands
in northern Illinois

513
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,860
after having been pushed out,

514
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,029
at which point
they were chased up

515
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:11,765
and through southeast Wisconsin.

516
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:16,170
Only about 150 of the 1,000
tribe members surviving

517
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:21,808
after a year of battles with
General Henry Atkinson's army.

518
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,613
The Indigenous history of the
region was known by Niedecker,

519
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,983
who writes in a 1941 letter
to Zukofsky

520
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,620
of Chief Black Hawk's
autobiography.

521
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:35,722
She writes,

522
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,293
"And once more I read
<i>The Black Hawk War</i>

523
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,261
"and Old Chief Black Hawk,

524
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:45,032
"who lost his women and children
in the swamps where I live

525
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:48,001
"so the white army
wouldn't find him.

526
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,370
"After I read about
the Black Hawk War,

527
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:53,540
"I didn't think much
of white people.

528
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:55,642
"That war started
with Black Hawk

529
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:59,079
"and his men crossing
the Mississippi River over

530
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:02,115
"into Illinois
with a white flag of truce.

531
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:06,286
"And our soldiers didn't stop
for that, just shot him down.

532
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,955
"Then Black Hawk was captured

533
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:10,390
"and taken on a trip
over the east,

534
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:12,059
"shown to the president,

535
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,795
"and he dictated his life
to a Frenchman.

536
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,998
And that's one
of my great books."

537
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:21,235
Niedecker's life
and poetic subjects

538
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:23,704
are inextricably linked
to her understanding

539
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,006
of the land she lives on

540
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:30,377
and the ecology, geology,
and violences of her region,

541
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:33,313
as well as her lifelong sense
of connection

542
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,384
between private property
and corruption.

543
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:40,754
A poem
in <i>New Goose</i> reads,

544
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,324
"Black Hawk held: In reason

545
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:48,962
"land cannot be sold,
only things to be carried away,

546
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,697
"and I am old.

547
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:55,002
"Young Lincoln's general moved,
papaw in bloom,

548
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:59,806
and to this day, Black Hawk,
reason has small room."

549
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:04,044
Ten.

550
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:07,247
Years later,
after her parents die

551
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:09,750
and Lorine
inherits her family's property,

552
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:14,154
which would by then be a smaller
acreage punctuated by cabins

553
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,024
still rented out
to hunters and fishermen.

554
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,128
She lives in an ongoing state
of discomfort at this ownership,

555
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:24,898
a concept she'll always despise
as well as dread

556
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:28,335
at having to save the land
repeatedly from floods and taxes

557
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,704
and debt and disrepair.

558
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,307
On the other hand,

559
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,342
though it's never a
permanent source of income

560
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:39,213
such that Niedecker doesn't
need help or have to work,

561
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,615
she does possess a room
of her own

562
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:45,986
and lives in it as an artist
for several decades alone.

563
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:48,288
She also lives in a place
with unstable,

564
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,391
unpredictable,
and quickly shifting weather.

565
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,394
Black Hawk Island,
a frequently flooding swamp

566
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,130
except for when it's frozen.

567
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,267
She doesn't have
indoor plumbing for years.

568
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,668
One's entire day or mood

569
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:06,707
could be determined by what
they see looking out the window.

570
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:08,909
In a letter she writes,

571
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,645
"Early in life,
I looked back of our buildings

572
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,881
"to the lake and said,

573
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:17,217
"'I am what I am
because of all of this.

574
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,486
"I am what is around me.

575
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:21,989
These woods have made me.'"

576
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:29,096
This is a a picture
from a little after she died,

577
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:33,834
but presumably what
the flooding would look like.

578
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,336
Eleven.

579
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:38,572
Lorine reads all the time,

580
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:41,742
nearly anything
she can get her hands on,

581
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:44,745
though she's often drawn
to the avant garde,

582
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,381
the aesthetically innovative,
biographies,

583
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:51,985
naturalist texts, and Modernist
and classical poetry.

584
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:55,589
She calls her personal library
her "immortal cupboard,"

585
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:59,426
and some of her books include
biographies of Mary Shelley,

586
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:04,198
Beethoven, Winslow Homer,
Henry James, and Hopkins.

587
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:06,800
She possesses the letters
of Lord Byron,

588
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:11,038
Emily Dickinson,
Flaubert, Freud, Keats, Rilke,

589
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,209
Stevens, Woolf,
and Edna St. Vincent Millay,

590
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:17,211
as well as
environmentalist texts like

591
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:20,414
<i>The Life of the Bee,</i>
<i>Birds and Their Attributes,</i>

592
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,817
and <i>The Journals</i>
<i>of Lewis and Clark.</i>

593
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,652
She reads deeply and widely,

594
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,488
with small press books
sent to her from friends

595
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,524
and from publishers.

596
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:33,327
Other titles ordered
through Madison's bookstores

597
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:38,098
or found at Fort Atkinson
and Milwaukee libraries.

598
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:40,968
My favorite find
in her personal catalog,

599
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,636
which is available in full

600
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,872
at the Friends of Niedecker
website,

601
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:47,174
is John Cage's <i>Silence.</i>

602
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:51,278
I wonder what she thought
of that.

603
00:31:53,514 --> 00:31:55,182
Twelve.

604
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,220
After she returns from Madison
in the early '40s,

605
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:02,723
Niedecker lives
in the previously mentioned

606
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,459
and seen here
one-and-a-half-room cabin

607
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:08,562
not far from her parents,
built for her by Henry,

608
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:11,031
around which
plum trees were planted

609
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,168
and Niedecker reclaimed
another several feet of lawn

610
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,236
from the wilderness.

611
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:20,040
Her parents are still at odds,
barely speaking,

612
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:24,778
but she has an okay relationship
with both of them.

613
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:27,548
She mentions in her letters

614
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,250
that she'll roast a chicken
for guests,

615
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:33,086
sometimes make a chicken salad.

616
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:37,391
She'll go to the supper club's
fish fry when invited, a treat.

617
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,927
Later, when she meets Al,
they'll cook together

618
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:44,164
and she'll keep recipe books
with cutouts and notes.

619
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:47,801
For Al, she makes the usual
Midwestern dishes,

620
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:50,737
tips ripped out
of a lady's magazine.

621
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:54,775
Regular ingredients
include marshmallows, mayo,

622
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:57,411
bacon, a casserole or meat,

623
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:03,050
pickled veggies, corn,
anything afloat in gelatin.

624
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,756
When they're out, Lorine will
have the occasional Grasshopper.

625
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,760
Thirteen.

626
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:21,401
In 1944, Niedecker gets a job
at <i>Hoard's Dairyman,</i>

627
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,770
a journal devoted
to dairy farming,

628
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:26,507
where she proofs
agricultural articles.

629
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,242
She's 41.

630
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:32,713
It's the year of <i>Gaslight</i>
and <i>Meet Me in St. Louis.</i>

631
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,849
She buys herself a new dress
and hat in Madison.

632
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:40,020
The dress has a black velvet
jacket and very colored skirt,

633
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,890
a rare purchase, though
she's attentive to fashion,

634
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:46,360
having always desired
a fur coat.

635
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,762
Niedecker doesn't
really like the job.

636
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,597
Many days, she walks
the four miles

637
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,566
into Fort Atkinson and back

638
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,535
northeast
on Black Hawk Island Road,

639
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:57,271
then Riverside Drive
along the rock,

640
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,072
except for when
she gets a ride in,

641
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:01,642
in which case she reads
the paper at a nearby hotel

642
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,443
before work starts.

643
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,446
Niedecker's letters show
she dislikes <i>Hoard's</i>

644
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:09,183
not so much because of the work,
which is tedious,

645
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,051
but which she is good at,

646
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:15,088
but because of a despised,
bullying coworker.

647
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:18,225
At any rate, she gets
some poems out of it.

648
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:20,327
One's a kind of persona poem

649
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,863
in the voice of her boss,
A.J. Glover,

650
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,167
the editor of the magazine
and a big ag man in Wisconsin,

651
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,803
recognized by Hoover in 1930

652
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,272
as the man who had made
the greatest contribution

653
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:36,176
to American agriculture
during the decade.

654
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,813
Nearly no one local
knows she's a poet.

655
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:45,452
Niedecker quits Hoard
six years later in June of 1950

656
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,222
when her eyes can no longer
focus for so long

657
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:50,357
on such little print.

658
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,926
After that,
she goes on disability benefits

659
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:54,995
for a number of years.

660
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,932
Niedecker worries about money
her entire life,

661
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:02,035
and her finances
are a complex combination

662
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,672
of overlapping
specific situations.

663
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,243
She doesn't purchase much
for herself.

664
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,211
Boots, books, food.

665
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:14,581
She later, in her 50s and 60s,

666
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:19,186
makes a modest income on the
rent of her family properties,

667
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:22,422
much of which is then
also spent on lawyer fees

668
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,491
for taxes and upkeep.

669
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,028
She's poor, but sends money
to the Zukofskys

670
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:31,632
when they need it,
and they send some back.

671
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:34,902
Her father builds her
a cabin to live in.

672
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,303
She has few expenses.

673
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,173
No large family, no children.

674
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,742
Every few years,
a bunch of her possessions

675
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,045
get swept away
or ruined in a flood.

676
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:48,148
She worked several jobs
of varying pay,

677
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:51,218
marriage to Al
eventually allowing her to quit

678
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:53,787
right around retirement age.

679
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,689
She thinks and writes
about the lives

680
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:57,724
of the working class.

681
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:02,462
In her own life, there isn't
anyone quite like her.

682
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,500
Fourteen.

683
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:13,273
"All of this could be told as
a narrative of female pathos,"

684
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,143
writes poet scholar
Rachel Blau DuPlessis

685
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,113
in her essay "Lorine Niedecker,
the Anonymous."

686
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,284
"But feminist critics must
insist on the agency of writers

687
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,752
"and the series of choices,

688
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:30,057
"even among narrow options,
even favoring self-erasure,

689
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:34,061
which allow a person
to construct an oeuvre."

690
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:37,264
And then later,
in the same essay,

691
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:43,036
"Every time she is mentioned,
she must be reintroduced."

692
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,406
Fifteen.

693
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,110
Copies of <i>New Goose</i>
and Zukofsky's <i>Anew</i>

694
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:53,514
arrive at her house
in March 1946,

695
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,549
both having
recently been published

696
00:36:55,616 --> 00:37:00,420
by James Decker's micropress
out of Prairie City, Illinois.

697
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,991
It's Niedecker's first book,
and she's 43.

698
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,626
The river's flooded.

699
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:07,494
She writes in a letter that,

700
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,264
"Water here is eight inches
on the driveway,"

701
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,399
and her and Daisy
dance around the kitchen

702
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:15,269
in hip boots, two silly goofs.

703
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,804
Lorine's proud, she's pleased.

704
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:20,807
Her poetry is published,
she's got new waders.

705
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:23,677
Both causes for celebration.

706
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:27,214
In the letter
she writes to tell Zukofsky

707
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:30,350
of the arrival of the books,
Niedecker closes with details

708
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:33,253
about access
to purchasing stockings,

709
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,024
information meant
to be passed along to Celia.

710
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,993
And also says "Rezzy"--
Charles Reznikoff--

711
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,863
wrote to compliment her
about <i>New Goose.</i>

712
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,533
He's already read the book
and enjoyed it.

713
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,571
Niedecker is not above
being annoyed by publishing.

714
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,874
In a later letter,
she's "hot under the collar."

715
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:57,544
Concord Publishing has printed
parts of her poems in bold,

716
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:01,949
an annoyance that grows
on her, itchy error.

717
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:03,817
Throughout her correspondences,

718
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:07,087
Niedecker rants, raves,
compliments, and thrills

719
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:10,357
over her interactions
with editors and printers,

720
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:14,194
as well as the state
of small press publishing,

721
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:16,797
which was the way
she and most Modernist,

722
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:20,100
most Objectivist poets
published.

723
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,970
The history of innovative
American poetry,

724
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:27,341
always located in presses
run by a handful of editors,

725
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:30,777
publishing and selling
in small quantities.

726
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:32,346
Readership occurring

727
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:35,282
via word of mouth,
literary reviews,

728
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:38,919
hand-gifted books,
and friendships.

729
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:43,056
Niedecker is invested
in the process.

730
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:45,726
She thinks about fonts,
distribution,

731
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:49,596
printing schedules,
layout, and printing costs.

732
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:51,231
She's alternately grateful,

733
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:54,535
irritated, and enlivened
by the act of publishing,

734
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:59,072
which she considers a necessary
part of her writing life.

735
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:04,511
She's ambitious and pragmatic,
thankful, social, exacting.

736
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:09,850
She appreciates the labor that
goes into these collaborations.

737
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:12,219
She's self-deprecating
and self-aware,

738
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:14,655
while often feeling like
an outsider,

739
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:17,524
which she both was and wasn't.

740
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,794
Niedecker's connected
and deeply respected,

741
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,763
if rarely featured.

742
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,566
She's admired, if not rewarded,

743
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:29,403
her thinking crucial to the work
of several other peer poets,

744
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:32,973
if also simultaneously
overlooked.

745
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:36,543
She's considered
graceful and intelligent

746
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,212
by many of her male peers,

747
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:40,948
while at the same time,
few of them do much

748
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:42,716
as they do for each other

749
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:47,120
to include her in poetry's
public happenings.

750
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,056
Though, even when they do,

751
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:52,226
she doesn't always want
to be a part of it.

752
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:55,028
She never teaches
or gives readings.

753
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:59,600
She keeps her writing close,
sometimes even a secret.

754
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,502
Coming from a folk tradition,

755
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,871
Niedecker believes
in the power of her work

756
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,106
in the world without her.

757
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,545
Sixteen.

758
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:17,618
She loves Chopin
and she loves Beethoven,

759
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:19,786
though she wonders
if her love of Beethoven

760
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:23,123
is a bit ordinary
or embarrassing.

761
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,826
She loves Paul Zukofsky's
violin.

762
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:27,861
With Henry,
she listens to a recording

763
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,997
of Paul playing on the radio.

764
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:35,135
She loves the records gifted
to her from local friends.

765
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:37,104
She writes that
she wishes she could hear

766
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:40,073
Duke Ellington's
"Black, Brown and Beige,"

767
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,442
which wouldn't
have been possible,

768
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:43,777
so says a footnote written

769
00:40:43,844 --> 00:40:46,580
by the Niedecker scholar
Jenny Penberthy

770
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,349
in the letters
between her and Zukofsky,

771
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,619
because of a 1940s ban
on recordings

772
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:58,358
imposed in order to ensure
attendance at live performances.

773
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:01,195
Seventeen.

774
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:04,765
June 6, 1948.

775
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,335
Complaints about the neighbor
who's,

776
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:10,771
"mowed me down
my dogwoods and tree

777
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,372
with his power lawnmower,"

778
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:16,510
while she's out there with
a corn knife trimming the edges.

779
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:18,645
She takes
a conservationist stance

780
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:20,881
and can't stand to see
a fisherman catch carp

781
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,449
without a permit

782
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:25,285
and the children
scooping up birds' eggs,

783
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,821
disrupting the habitats.

784
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,291
She's exasperated by nature,

785
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,261
last week, including
human nature, she says,

786
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:39,299
of her irritating encounters
with less attentive neighbors.

787
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:41,502
Her life in Black Hawk.

788
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,504
Mowing, digging.

789
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,105
Planting, reading.

790
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,840
Shoveling, listening.

791
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,709
Weeding, cutting.

792
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,179
"I cut grass there
and planted willows,

793
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:54,915
"my eyes to the green ground
so much

794
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:58,218
that I can almost feel
seawater in my veins,"

795
00:41:58,285 --> 00:42:00,020
she writes in a letter,

796
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:03,457
phrases that will later appear
in "Paean to Place,"

797
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,758
her late, long poem

798
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:08,495
about Black Hawk Island
and her family.

799
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:11,765
While she cares for the woods,
the yard, the river's edge,

800
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:13,634
her mind's on fire.

801
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,636
Bits of the world
work themselves

802
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,005
into and through
her imagination.

803
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:19,773
She describes the yard

804
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,409
where there are,
"little things like algae,

805
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:25,946
"fine-haired weeds mixed
with large-bladed grass,

806
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:28,015
"and lots of wild mint

807
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,251
"where I wanted to mow
with corn knife.

808
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:32,419
"But I wouldn't.

809
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:35,055
Such sweet little things."

810
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:39,259
As she cuts and curates,
mulches and tends,

811
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:43,130
Niedecker's mind
is always also rearranging,

812
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:47,334
keeping scraps of the earth
to grow in poems.

813
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:50,671
Eighteen.

814
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,344
Around this time,
Niedecker is written up

815
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,913
in the local news
for the first time,

816
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,250
outed as a poet in a list
of other famous people

817
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:05,219
from Fort Atkinson,

818
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:08,922
including the makers
of dairy equipment, sausages,

819
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,859
canned goods,
and barn equipment.

820
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,527
They spell her name wrong.

821
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,828
[audience chuckling]

822
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:17,030
She's not thrilled
about being in the paper.

823
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:20,267
Her whole life,
she's worried, right or wrong,

824
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:24,371
that her neighbors will consider
her strange for being a poet.

825
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,273
It's not common,
and she doesn't like

826
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,709
drawing attention to herself.

827
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,911
She wants her writing
to speak for itself

828
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,080
in the circles
it's intended for,

829
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:36,783
which, for her,
are mostly other poets.

830
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,720
"Now that they do know, I can't
wait until they read <i>Goose,"</i>

831
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:43,757
she writes, "but they
probably won't bother."

832
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:46,627
She's irritated,
but like most things,

833
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,629
Lorine's got a sense of humor.

834
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:50,797
She quips, "Such is fame

835
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,466
that I'm linked
to a sausage maker."

836
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:54,067
[audience laughing]

837
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,336
At any rate,
she can't send this joke

838
00:43:56,403 --> 00:43:59,306
to Zukofsky until Thursday.

839
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:01,642
She doesn't have the three cents
she needs for a stamp

840
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,377
until payday.

841
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:09,283
Nineteen.

842
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,451
These are the books
published in her lifetime,

843
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:12,886
just to say.

844
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,621
Nineteen.

845
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,991
In the late '40s
and into the '50s,

846
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:20,494
Niedecker's working
on her second book,

847
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:23,730
which is eventually called
<i>For Paul and Other Poems,</i>

848
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:27,100
never to be published
in her lifetime.

849
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:31,205
The book is about family,
hers and the Zukofskys,

850
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:34,274
material often sourced
from conversations with them

851
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:36,476
and correspondence.

852
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:40,214
She'll take a phrase someone
said, Henry mentioning,

853
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,784
"There's nothing sweeter
than violin music," for example,

854
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,853
and rearrange,
tossing it into a piece

855
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:47,187
with other bits and scraps

856
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:50,424
of description,
insight, and rhyme.

857
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,892
Some scholars,

858
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,228
and possibly, seemingly,
probably

859
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:56,363
the Zukofskys themselves,

860
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,733
felt uncomfortable
about her writing poems

861
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,536
for and about a child
that wasn't hers,

862
00:45:02,603 --> 00:45:04,838
the child of an ex-boyfriend.

863
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:08,275
But who's weirder with language
than a kid?

864
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:11,378
The poetic material of <i>For Paul</i>

865
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:15,582
could also be seen
as an ambitious next step.

866
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:20,187
From <i>New Goose's</i> politics
and language of the masses

867
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:24,892
to <i>For Paul's</i> intimate
engagements and inside jokes,

868
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:28,462
it's also in these years
that Niedecker's parents die,

869
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:31,832
and she no longer
has a family of her own.

870
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:36,103
Paul's presence in the poems
is subtle but orienting.

871
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,306
He's a bright young hope,
chatty and clever.

872
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:42,276
His inclusion may be a way
of acknowledging

873
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:45,412
the unknowable
and the unseeable.

874
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:48,415
Paul the primary exposure
in Niedecker's life

875
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:50,717
to the next generation.

876
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:56,523
But Zukofsky doesn't
want her to publish them.

877
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,825
She eventually does
individually,

878
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:01,295
but never as a collection.

879
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:03,597
She doesn't
completely understand,

880
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:06,533
and things between them
get cool for a bit,

881
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,268
a little distant.

882
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:12,039
Niedecker says after a batch
of four "Paul" poems

883
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:16,743
have been published in the 1955
<i>Quarterly Review of Literature</i>

884
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:21,748
that the poets in it seemed
too educated and sophisticated

885
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:25,085
and that, "Those," meaning
the four "Paul" poems,

886
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:26,920
"are my best in many years

887
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:31,291
"because they're about something
real and good and human.

888
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:33,293
"I've lost something since then.

889
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,929
Need subjects to focus on."

890
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,999
One might wonder
if this is premonition

891
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:43,504
of her great long poems,
this need for an external,

892
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:48,175
real, and good subject
to collect her thinking.

893
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:52,079
She seems to desire something
or someone outside herself

894
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:55,449
to focus the best
of her attention on.

895
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:58,986
In 1957, Niedecker gets a job
cleaning floors

896
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:02,022
at the Fort Atkinson
Memorial Hospital,

897
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,924
a day shift, saying,

898
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:07,694
"The setup's
a pretty democratic system.

899
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:10,797
"Office girls on easy terms
with cleaning women.

900
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:11,965
"At least with me.

901
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,700
"But I don't care.

902
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,969
"What happens to me
after I get home

903
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:18,839
"and a little rested
on Saturday and Sunday

904
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:21,408
is all that matters to me."

905
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,610
In 1961, she publishes

906
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:26,647
her second book,
<i>My Friend Tree,</i>

907
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,315
a compilation of new work

908
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,584
and some reprints
from <i>New Goose,</i>

909
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:33,554
with a small press in Scotland.

910
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:37,624
Twenty.

911
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:44,631
In 1963, Niedecker meets
and marries Al Millen,

912
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:47,301
an industrial painter
working the third shift

913
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:51,872
in a Milwaukee factory,
divorced with grown kids.

914
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,607
Lorine's 60.

915
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:57,377
They live between his place
on the south side of the city

916
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,646
and hers in Black Hawk Island,

917
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:05,352
eventually building a new cabin
of their own on her property.

918
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:07,855
Al's fun and kind
and seemingly respects

919
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:12,226
Lorine's need to scribble,
a need she doesn't hide.

920
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:16,096
He learns not to bother her
when writing, not to interrupt,

921
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:18,031
and Niedecker writes
some of her best work

922
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:20,367
in the last seven years
of her life,

923
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:24,872
in part due to the time
Al's material support allows.

924
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:27,174
She quits the hospital.

925
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,477
In these years,
she also grows close

926
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:32,546
to the poet Cid Corman,

927
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:36,617
who frequently publishes
her work in his journal, <i>Origin,</i>

928
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:40,120
and writes her regularly
about poetry and publishing

929
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:43,190
from where he is living
in Japan.

930
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,158
Niedecker has been working

931
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:48,662
with a five-line,
haiku-influenced stanza.

932
00:48:48,729 --> 00:48:51,532
Writing small poems,
she eventually binds

933
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:55,068
and handmade books
for Zukofsky, Corman,

934
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:56,870
and Jonathan Williams,

935
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:59,373
the publisher
of The Jargon Society,

936
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:02,676
who eventually releases
a collected of her work

937
00:49:02,743 --> 00:49:06,647
called <i>T & G</i> in 1969,
a year before she dies.

938
00:49:11,718 --> 00:49:13,387
Twenty-one.

939
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:22,029
In 1966 and '67, Niedecker
writes "Lake Superior,"

940
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:26,867
one of the greatest Objectivist,
Midwestern, global, ecological,

941
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:29,970
documentary,
and geological poems

942
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:32,706
ever written, in my opinion.

943
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,475
The poem's language

944
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:38,912
is simultaneously expansive
and small,

945
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,915
inclusive of the human and non,

946
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:45,752
the historical,
and the endearingly personal.

947
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:50,591
It's a long poem for Niedecker,
a 13-part minimalist epic

948
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:54,261
with 21 lines
to the longest section,

949
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:57,831
and is being written
in the late 1960s Midwest

950
00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:00,267
during the Vietnam War,

951
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:02,736
just a few years
after Kennedy's shot

952
00:50:02,803 --> 00:50:05,272
and the environmentalist
Gaylord Nelson,

953
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:09,676
founder of Earth Day
and inspiration for the EPA,

954
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:13,080
becomes Wisconsin's
U.S. Senator.

955
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:16,250
Aldo Leopold's
<i>Sand County Almanac</i>

956
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:19,586
was published
two decades earlier.

957
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:24,224
Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i>
has just come out.

958
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:29,329
In the summer of 1966,
Lorine and Al take a vacation,

959
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,732
heading partway around
Lake Superior

960
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:34,768
on the Circle Tour,
a loop of highway

961
00:50:34,835 --> 00:50:38,372
taking one around any
or all of the Great Lakes.

962
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:40,774
Their version
brings them northeast

963
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:42,576
through Green Bay and Manistique

964
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:45,279
into Canada
via Sault Ste. Marie,

965
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:49,149
through Wawa and Port Arthur,
then down to Minnesota,

966
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:52,653
stopping to visit Al's
childhood home in Swan River

967
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,889
before dipping back
into northern Wisconsin

968
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:58,859
and heading home to Milwaukee.

969
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,695
In preparation for the trip,

970
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:05,866
Niedecker writes over 300 pages
of dense prose.

971
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,437
Her notes are drawn from texts
on the history of the region,

972
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:13,240
books on botany and geology,

973
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:17,311
conversations, scholarships,
pamphlets.

974
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:22,216
She's interested in research,
testimony, and the document.

975
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:26,186
The force of plain,
factual, lifted proof,

976
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:31,258
or "the raw material of poetry
and all its rawness,"

977
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:36,330
as Marianne Moore, an influence
of hers, would say it.

978
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:39,833
A year later,
in the summer of 1967,

979
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,902
they return to see
the South Shore,

980
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:44,204
and Niedecker composes
the long poem

981
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,474
that would begin her third book,
<i>North Central,</i>

982
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,776
starting with a stanza.

983
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,180
"In every part
of every living thing

984
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:55,916
"is stuff that once was rock.

985
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:00,020
In blood,
the minerals of the rock."

986
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,458
Twenty-two.

987
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,963
"Lake Superior"
is a collage poem.

988
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,699
A technique used by Niedecker
frequently,

989
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:16,036
each section about
the lake's history and geology

990
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:18,405
complete but disconnected,

991
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,908
arranged out
of chronological order,

992
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:25,312
both the whole poem and
occurrences within each stanza.

993
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,714
The nonlinear assemblage
is perhaps a way

994
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:30,484
of making each phrase
or fragment

995
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:32,686
ecologically tantamount,

996
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:35,055
each layer one
among equivalents,

997
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:39,459
as if a poem could serve as
a visual cross-section of place,

998
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:43,764
the reader able to view
numerous historical moments

999
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,834
concurrently in the same space.

1000
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:50,437
The subjects in "Lake Superior"

1001
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:54,408
include rocks, love,
land rights, water,

1002
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:59,746
trade, time, race, empire,
evil, labor, animals,

1003
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:03,417
minerals, and corruption.

1004
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:08,188
From Marquette to Granite
and back again,

1005
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:11,058
Niedecker situates
the stanzas in "Lake Superior"

1006
00:53:11,124 --> 00:53:13,493
such that there are
different strata.

1007
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,064
For the geese, the voyagers,
the agate, and Al.

1008
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,868
Collage, a method of breaking
the already broken.

1009
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:23,670
Gathering, opposing, salvaging.

1010
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:27,307
It's a relational practice,
outward-oriented,

1011
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,743
a process of collecting
from the world

1012
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,312
and then rearranging it.

1013
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,748
Niedecker's poems
often enact the path

1014
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:37,217
one thing endures
to become another.

1015
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:40,621
It's possibly
haphazard transformation.

1016
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:44,157
Sand accumulating
irregularly to stone

1017
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:47,227
or thought escalating to action.

1018
00:53:50,597 --> 00:53:52,266
Twenty-three.

1019
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:57,337
A year after her first trip
around the lake,

1020
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,473
Niedecker writes
a second long poem,

1021
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,175
"Wintergreen Ridge,"

1022
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,745
better than "Lake Superior,"
in her opinion.

1023
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:07,447
She's just been to the Ridges
in Door County,

1024
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:09,950
about three hours north
of Milwaukee.

1025
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:11,818
Some of you probably know it.

1026
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:15,422
Where the land rolls
from Lake Michigan in waves

1027
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:19,693
and the forests are some
of the southernmost boreal.

1028
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,162
Like Lake Superior,
the area is another

1029
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:24,765
geologically unique
Wisconsin site

1030
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:26,433
within driving distance.

1031
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,836
And "Wintergreen Ridge"
is the first poem

1032
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:32,706
Niedecker describes
as having a "let-go approach,"

1033
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:35,843
which means to her
a return to the associative

1034
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:38,445
and surrealist gestures
of her youth,

1035
00:54:38,512 --> 00:54:43,083
alongside naming the scientific
and the exacting.

1036
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,854
Niedecker calls this blend
of poetics "reflectivism,"

1037
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,159
describing a praxis she's newly
verbalizing as her own.

1038
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:57,197
Twenty-four.

1039
00:54:57,664 --> 00:54:59,433
Niedecker's immortal cabinet

1040
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:03,537
is rife with writers situating
a specific place's narrative

1041
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:06,473
by documenting
its transformation.

1042
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,175
Niedecker read
the travel writing

1043
00:55:08,242 --> 00:55:10,911
of Alexander von Humboldt,
Basho,

1044
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:13,847
and John Muir,
who grew up just north of her

1045
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:16,149
in Portage, Wisconsin.

1046
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,886
She owns a Margaret Fuller
biography

1047
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:20,687
and would presumably
have been familiar

1048
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:22,723
with Fuller's
<i>Summer on the Lakes,</i>

1049
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:26,460
a travelogue describing
Fuller's 1843 trip

1050
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:28,629
through the Great Lakes.

1051
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:31,198
When increasing interest
of Niedecker's

1052
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:33,867
in her longer, later poems

1053
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:36,937
is description
of place or person over time.

1054
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,573
She writes multi-sectional
biographical works

1055
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,710
about Thomas Jefferson,
William Morris, and Darwin.

1056
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:46,780
She's interested in the
ecological conundrums

1057
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,782
emerging from the specific

1058
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:52,819
environmentalist consciousness
of her region,

1059
00:55:52,886 --> 00:55:55,789
and is one of many
mid-century writers attempting

1060
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:59,426
to integrate natural patterns
into a form

1061
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:03,997
true to the exploitations
of its inhabitants.

1062
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:07,134
Niedecker understood
that the place where she lived,

1063
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,537
the plot of land
she claims gave her everything,

1064
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:14,041
was never really hers
to begin with.

1065
00:56:14,107 --> 00:56:18,445
One of her later poems,
"Foreclosure," reads,

1066
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:22,850
"Tell 'em to take
my bare walls down,

1067
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:27,287
"my cement abutments,
their parties thereof,

1068
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:29,356
"and clause of claws.

1069
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,859
"Leave me the land.

1070
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,628
"Scratch out: the land.

1071
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:38,131
"May prose and property
both die out

1072
00:56:38,198 --> 00:56:40,100
and leave me peace."

1073
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:45,639
Twenty-five.

1074
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,775
Lorine dies too young.

1075
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,979
She passes in 1970 at age 67

1076
00:56:52,946 --> 00:56:57,518
in the dregs of winter
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

1077
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,920
Al quickly destroys
her journals and drafts,

1078
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:02,556
as she's instructed him to.

1079
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,726
And so the rest is up to us.

1080
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,195
Her Black Hawk cabin remains.

1081
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,897
You can go see it.

1082
00:57:09,963 --> 00:57:11,865
And her poems
are read everywhere,

1083
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:14,868
all around the world,
and especially in Wisconsin,

1084
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:17,070
where they're taught
in public schools

1085
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:19,239
and you can see them
on the sides of buildings,

1086
00:57:19,306 --> 00:57:20,407
as you all know.

1087
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:23,177
Just drive down Fort Atkinson.

1088
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:24,845
And it's been my experience

1089
00:57:24,912 --> 00:57:27,748
that everywhere you go
looking for Niedecker,

1090
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:30,851
her name begins a conversation,

1091
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:33,587
her work meaningful
to poets and readers

1092
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:36,957
for its intersection
of ecology and folk rhythms,

1093
00:57:37,024 --> 00:57:41,161
rhymes fit for children,
collective political thinking,

1094
00:57:41,228 --> 00:57:44,464
and place-based interrogations.

1095
00:57:45,365 --> 00:57:48,235
So if you're interested in
learning more about Niedecker,

1096
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:51,071
I'm gonna close
with three first suggestions.

1097
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:52,639
Some of you might know these,

1098
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:55,008
but for those of you
who don't.

1099
00:57:55,075 --> 00:57:58,212
One is to purchase
her <i>Collected Works,</i>

1100
00:57:58,278 --> 00:58:00,747
which is edited by the
brilliant Niedecker scholar

1101
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,150
Jenny Penberthy,
who's done a whole bunch

1102
00:58:03,217 --> 00:58:05,552
of great Niedecker work.

1103
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:08,722
Two is to buy the edition
of the poem "Lake Superior,"

1104
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:12,125
published by Wave Editions
about a decade ago.

1105
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:14,728
And three is to visit the
Friends of Niedecker website,

1106
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,664
where there's a whole pile
of resources and info

1107
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:19,199
about her writing.

1108
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:22,603
And I'll leave you all here
tonight,

1109
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:26,106
although I hope the conversation
keeps going,

1110
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,976
with a prompt for our lives
and our writing

1111
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:32,479
for writers
directly from Lorine.

1112
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,850
"For best work," she writes,

1113
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,386
"you ought to put forth
some effort

1114
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:42,923
to stand in Northwoods
among birch."

1115
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:45,392
Thank you.

1116
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:47,694
