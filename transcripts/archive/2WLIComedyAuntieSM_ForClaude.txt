00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,611
- Angela Fitzgerald: It's nearly
show time at the Improv.

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,778
- We can't wait!

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,114
- Tonight's headliner
is Chastity Washington.

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,519
She is marking a milestone:
30 years in stand-up comedy.

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,621
This is a long time coming,
you know, so...

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,222
- Angela: Chastity didn't expect
comedy

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,391
to become a lifelong avocation.

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,460
Freshman year at UW-Parkside,

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,463
Chastity and a sorority sister
saw a notice

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,332
for the student talent show
during homecoming.

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,768
- I remember contemplating it,
and she's like,

13
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,136
"I already signed you up,
whatever.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,471
Just, you're gonna do it."

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,072
You know, I was like,
"Oh, my God!"

16
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,008
You know, so,
I wasn't seeking it out.

17
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,176
It found me.

18
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,844
- Hello, Chas!
- Hi!

19
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:47,114
- Angela: Her sorority sisters
still come out to cheer her on.

20
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,384
- I don't have enough words
to have that type of support

21
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,219
for your life.

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,821
- Angela: Chastity also gets
support from her fraternity

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,423
of fellow comedians.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,261
They call me Auntie, [laughs]
but I like to see people grow.

25
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,063
- And are you ready
for your headliner tonight?

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,065
- Angela: Finally,
it's showtime.

27
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:09,803
- Host: Make a ton of noise
for Chastity Washington!

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,872

[upbeat music]

30
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,645
- Angela: The greatest influence
on Chastity's comedy

31
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,481
over the years
has been her day job.

32
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,284
- This is what teachers look
like when we off, you hear me?

33
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,719
How ya doing, y'all all right?

34
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,755
- Angela: During most of her
long career, when not on stage,

35
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:34,294
Chastity has been in schools,
teaching phy ed and drama.

36
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,297
An experience that has
given her plenty of material

37
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,599
over the years.

38
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,101
- Right, like now
at some schools,

39
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,771
if it's under 32 degrees,
the littles can't go outside,

40
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,140
which is ridiculous
to many of us.

41
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,376
'Cause we went outside,
it was nothing degrees.

42
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,544
[audience laughing]

43
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,713
You lost skin, eyes, fingers,
toes.

44
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,083
Somebody would bury you,
you'd be almost dead.

45
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,253
- Angela: Some of Chastity's
best material comes from kids

46
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,921
just being themselves.

47
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,890
- "Miss Washington,
can you help them?

48
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,157
"We doing th
activities portion.

49
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,325
"We doing the color wheel.

50
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,627
Could you help them?"

51
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,029
So we doing the color wheel,
and I asked them, I said,

52
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,031
"If you mix yellow and blue,
what do you get?"

53
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,833
And one of boys raised his hand
real fast.

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,001
I said, "You."

55
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,136
He said, "I wanna be
a firefighter."

56
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,205
[audience laughing]

57
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,211
True story.

58
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,746
That's what makes it fun.

59
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,282
That's the beauty of kids,
you know what I mean?

60
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,751
- Angela: Chastity herself
was a Milwaukee kid,

61
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,420
whose extended family
helped raise her,

62
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,556
especially her grandparents.

63
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,691
- Like, the house always,
you know,

64
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,726
smell like bakery and mothballs.

65
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,894
[audience laughing]

66
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,062
Oh, I love my grandparents.

67
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,331
They was married 65 years,
right?

68
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,499
[audience applauding]

69
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,667
They're wonderful.

70
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,935
[laughing]
Wonderful.

71
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,572
Consistent, it gave me a
different appreciation

72
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,841
and respect
for family in general.

73
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,844
- Angela: Chastity's extended
family makes for another source

74
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,348
of her relatable material, and
some outrageous stories as well.

75
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,550
- And you ever find out
something about a family member

76
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,818
you didn't know?

77
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,120
Like, we was sitting around
talking about my auntie.

78
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,722
We was talking about,
"Oh, she was wonderful.

79
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,324
"Maybe she did this,
maybe she did that."

80
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,491
And they was like, "Yeah,

81
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,126
but what about that time
she stabbed Frank?"

82
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,063
Stabbed Frank?
[audience laughing]

83
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:21,802
Absolutely true story, exactly
how it happened. [laughing]

84
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,905
I thank you guys so much.
[audience cheering]

85
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,907
And friends and family,
thank you.

86
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,309
- Angela: She ends the night
marking 30 years

87
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,678
of making people laugh.

88
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,347
[audience cheering]

89
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,449
[friends exclaiming]

90
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:39,653
Surrounded by fans and
friends, new and old.

91
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,822
- All: Yay!

92
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,057
- That was awesome to see, yes.

93
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,326
It's just very fulfilling.

94
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,430
You just grateful that
people enjoy what you doing.

95
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,932
- We love you so much, honey.

96
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,800
- Chastity: That is wonderful
to me.

97
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,170
One for the record books,
you know?

98
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,905
Mm-hmm.
