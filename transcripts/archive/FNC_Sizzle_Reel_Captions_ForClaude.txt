1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,751
Our climate is changing,

2
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,211
but so are we.

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,671
All across Wisconsin,

4
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,131
people are taking action

5
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,174
on behalf of our environment.

6
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,468
Learn alongside me, Ami!

7
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,679

00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,765
As I talk with

10
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,393
Climate Experts

11
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,562
Changemakers

12
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,397
and youth activists

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,440
about the science

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,607
and solutions

15
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,817
to climate change.

16
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,402
So grab your notebook

17
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,445
and join me in the field.
