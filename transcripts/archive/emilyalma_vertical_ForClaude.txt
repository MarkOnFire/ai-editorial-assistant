Hi, I'm Emily, I'm a producer at PBS
Wisconsin, here at Mile of Music.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,600
And my name's Alma, I'm
a videographer for PBS Wisconsin.

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,200
So we’re here at Mile and we are on

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,800
we’re calling it the the “docu-team.” 

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,433
We're getting more things documentary-style.

6
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,200
So we're interviewing people.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,766
We're talking to artists
that are getting free

8
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,866
health care, free dental care,
free haircuts.

9
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,266
And so we're getting that story.

10
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:21,633
This is my first time here
at Mile of Music.

11
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,100
I'm from Wisconsin and like, I didn’t know...  

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,900
but it's also my first time Appleton.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,800
So I'm most excited to just
fully absorb what everyone talks about

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
as this mecca experience for them.
They come back year after year.

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,666
So it kind of hits you hard...
wow, this is a really important time

16
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,766
and place
for people to have community.

17
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,466
And so I'm just like soaking that up.

18
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,766
My favorite part about this
whole experience 

19
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:48,000
has been traveling
with the whole crew of videographers.

20
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:53,533
And as videographers at PBS, we don't
ever really get to work together.

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,700
And this is the first time...

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,533
I've been here for about three years,

23
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:04,166
and this is the first time that we're
all working collectively as a group.

24
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,600
There is a lot of energy
and collaboration,

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
and it's just really exciting
to be out here with

26
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,666
our coworkers.
