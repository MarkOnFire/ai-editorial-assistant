[piano music]

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,439
- My name is Atticus Coen.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:10,277
I am 18 years old and I go to
Sun Prairie East High School.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:15,215
I play the piano, and I've
played since kindergarten.

5
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,951
[applause]
[piano music]

6
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,088
I have one sister.

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,856
She's 16 years old.

8
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,525
She plays the clarinet.

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,360
We play music together a lot,
actually.

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,062
[piano and clarinet duet]

11
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,899
I work at Primal Cue.

12
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,367
My whole friend group
works there.

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,568
Sure, for here or to go?

14
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,270
It's really nice
to have something

15
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,038
that's also different
from music,

16
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,774
where it's just straightforward.

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,242
- That's great!

18
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,146
- Atticus: I'm also doing at my
school the musical, <i>Big Fish,</i>

19
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,316
and I'm in the pit for that,
on the keyboard.

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,252
Playing in the pit is
a very unique experience.

21
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,987
[piano music]

22
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,257
Things can go wrong and you have
to really be always ready

23
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:01,061
to, like, jump ahead
or to jump backwards.

24
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,999
A lot of music just
speaks to me.

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,734
[jazz music]

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,872
I'm really into jazz.

27
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,774
It's really free.

28
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:18,178
It's one of the most
expressive forms of music.

29
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,150
- Lana Robotewskyj:
Short chorus, keep it dry.

30
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,318
- Atticus: I'm currently
studying

31
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:29,189
at Melodiya Piano Academy
under Lana Robotewskyj.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,292
And I've been there with her
for eight years.

33
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,994
[Lana singing]

34
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,364
She really changed
how I practiced

35
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,766
and how music was presented
to me.

36
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,101
- Lana: That sounded great.

37
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,403
- Atticus: She brought me
to where I am today.

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,138
- Good. [singing]

39
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,942
- I think performing with the
Madison Symphony Orchestra

40
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,477
is gonna be really great.

41
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:55,415
I will be playing the Gershwin
Piano Concerto in F Major.

42
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,784
My teacher, Lana, helped me
select this piece.

43
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,121
She knew I have this love
for jazz,

44
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,457
and Gershwin has
a deep connection

45
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:06,760
between classical
and jazz music.

46
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,997
It has so much contrast.

47
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,132
The beginning
is very introspective.

48
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,570
And then later, it's bouncy
and fun and exciting.

49
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,108
It's going around all these
different characters

50
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:26,413
and just their lives and how
they kind of all intertwine.

51
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,217
Music really allows me
to express myself

52
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,085
without using my words.

53
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,687
Everything that I really have
been doing

54
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,723
has been revolving around music.

55
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,596
[ending note]

56
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,233
