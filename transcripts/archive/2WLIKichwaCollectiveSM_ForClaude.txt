00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,736
- Angela Fitzgerald:
In Madison,

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:06,974
a small but vibrant community
has been quietly planting roots,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,310
carrying with them
the traditions, stories,

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:14,314
and resilience
of the Kichwa people of Ecuador.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,183
- Jay Lema:
The Kichwa community in Madison

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,784
dates back
to around the year 2000,

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,521
when families began to arrive
from Ecuador.

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,523
This was, like,
our parents' generation.

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,159
So as we were growing up
in the diaspora community,

10
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:30,097
we as young people felt like we
wanted to visiblize our history

11
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,999
a little bit more,
so we came together,

12
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,035
and a group of us formed
the Kichwa Collective.

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,770
[bright music]

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,207
- Angela:
Grounded in Indigenous values

15
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,042
of collectivity and care,

16
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,812
the Kichwa Collective works
to preserve their heritage,

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,717
share their customs, and create
a home away from home.

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,254
- Michel Campos:
[speaking Spanish]

19
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,863
- Fabian Lema: I think the kids
just felt

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,031
that they were just floating.

21
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,867
They didn't have any roots
or anything

22
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,002
to really anchor their feet.

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,237
When the kids grew up,

24
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,472
they had a need to learn about
their own culture.

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,309
I'm very happy to see that,
for example, in Jay,

26
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,476
in looking at Jay.

27
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,378
He's an excellent musician.

28
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,814
[gentle acoustic music]

29
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,484
And now, my older son,
he's all about farming.

30
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,420
- Angela: Much of that farming
takes place

31
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,756
in their communal garden,
built on the tradition of minga,

32
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,126
collective work that binds
the community together.

33
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,829
- Paul Lema: So the minga is
something important to us

34
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,064
as Kichwas.

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,899
It's something that we can
share food, we'll laugh,

36
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,402
we'll have stories, and, you
know, kind of bully each other.

37
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,340
- Fabian: When we invite them
to our minga, they love it.

38
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,009
They say, some of them say that
this is for mental health.

39
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,344
"We need this.

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,714
We need to be together, farming,
getting our hands dirty."

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,251
- Angela: This land has also
connected the Kichwa community

42
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,454
to other Indigenous nations
in Wisconsin

43
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,624
through a shared love
and stewardship of corn.

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,859
- Paul:
Corn is very special out here.

45
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,895
We're not able to grow
our own corn

46
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,730
that's grown from Ecuador here.

47
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,064
It doesn't work; we've tried.

48
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,332
We're trying this year as well.

49
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,336
But in the meantime,
we're growing Oneida white corn.

50
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,138
I told them what we're doing
with my community,

51
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,108
and they gave us their corn
to take care of.

52
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,244
- Angela: Each year, the
community honors these efforts

53
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,115
through Inti Raymi, the
traditional harvest celebration

54
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,017
and solstice ceremony.

55
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,188
[bright acoustic music]
[woman singing in Kichwa]

56
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,224
- Michel: [speaking Spanish]

57
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:01,481
- It is very important for us,
because when we harvest,

58
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,318
we need to give thanks
to the Mother Earth.

59
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,652
- Angela: For the Kichwa,

60
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,689
these traditions are more
than ceremony.

61
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,060
Through music, farming, art,
and embroidery,

62
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,696
they're acts of survival
and memory.

63
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,097
- Nazka Serrano: It's a
beautiful thing

64
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,465
to see myself represented.

65
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,335
It changes something in, like,
your psyche and your heart

66
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,070
to see yourself.

67
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,808
A lot of our parents,
they were activists themselves.

68
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,145
They were cultural creators
and artists back home.

69
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,747
So what is happening now,

70
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:37,084
through, hopefully, creating
a space where that can happen,

71
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,855
is them being able to assert
that in a whole different way.

72
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,258
- Aída Inuca: We are not just
people that come and work

73
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,425
and something like that.

74
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,861
We have our history
that we bring.

75
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,496
We need to recognize

76
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,133
and be aware about that history
in the present.

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,802
- Angela: It's about more
than preserving the past.

78
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,504
It's about creating a future

79
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,141
where their work carries
the memory of their ancestors

80
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:05,112
while planting roots
for those yet to come.

81
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,247
- Nazka: It's remembering
who you are

82
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:11,351
and remembering that there's
already knowledge that you have,

83
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,087
that you have within, that
you have in your communities,

84
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,724
that our communities are not
people that came with nothing.

85
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,860
They're people that came
with everything,

86
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,163
and we continue to share,
and we continue to resist,

87
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,666
and we continue to carry
our traditions.

88
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,634
We are a living memory.

89
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,770
We are a living
collective memory.

90
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,606
And the way that our traditions
and our identity

91
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:36,009
and our culture lives
is through us.

92
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,213
