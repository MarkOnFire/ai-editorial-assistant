I choose
this fashion industry

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:16,542
just to enhance my culture,
my traditions,

5
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:20,375
and I want to empower
not just women in Afghanistan,

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,999
but across the world.

I'm Sarwat Najib.

I'm a graphic designer,

9
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,125
I'm a fashion designer,

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,625
and I'm a woman advocate.

11
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:39,291
I founded my own
Atelier fashion design outlet

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,542
in Kabul, Afghanistan.

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,999
Unfortunately,
50 years of war,

14
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,999
mostly women
are not educated.

15
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,999
There were a lot of women,
they came to my factory,

16
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:55,291
and they told me that we are not
allowed to go outside and work.

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,083
What about us?

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,999
You are empowering women
and we need your help.

19
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,959
So then, I decided
to give them projects,

20
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:02,999
home-based embroideries.

21
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,999
There are a lot of different
embroidery techniques,

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:10,875
so I use them into different,
like, a contemporary style.

23
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:17,375
I draw sketches
by myself.

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,999
Usually, I sketch
illustrations

25

my inspiration
is nature.

I designed
a fish mermaid dress

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,834
and it was like
a hand embroidery.

30
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:41,917
It was a 50-meter tulle,
a big train,

31
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:46,999
and it was, like,
my last design.

32
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,792
I never showcased that,

33
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:54,333
and Kabul collapsed
that time.

We were in
the factory,

35
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,291
we were working there,
and we have a news

36
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,625
that Taliban are,
they-- they--

37

they are just taking over
the Kabul.

we even
never hugged each other.

41

The scissors were on the table
and the cloth was,

42
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,999
and the fabric was there
and everything.

43
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,000
And even my pattern master,

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,792
she decided
to cover the fabric

45
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,709
because she said,
"This is expensive fabric.

46
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,999
I don't know when
we will come again."

We never go again.

So, we never went back,
we scattered.

49
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,375
After that,
we call each other,

50
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,291
"Where are you?
Are you safe?"

51

like, unfortunately,

53
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:47,041
So, you can go,
leave everything, right?

54
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,917

They destroyed

just because we are doing
a Western fashion.

60

They think
we are pro-Americans.

So, they destroy
even the, like, mannequins

it would be

If you hit a mountain for
50 years, it would be smashed.
