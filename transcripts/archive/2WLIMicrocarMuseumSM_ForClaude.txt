1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,303
[upbeat music]

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,409
- Attendee 1: What is this
little doohickey?

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,778
- Ingrid Krause: Thank you
for coming!

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,381
- Attendee 2: [laughing]
It's crazy!

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:19,353
- Attendee 3: I can see
how it would be fun. [laughing]

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,488
[car door closing]

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,559
- We have a collection
of microcars.

8
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,861
I have them from Spain,
I have them from France,

9
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,098
I have them from Italy, Germany.

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,833
- This is like a German, Spain.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,236
- Attendee 4: I like it,
it's wonderful.

12
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,538
- They are in mint condition.

13
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,373
They've been sitting inside.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,841
I'm Ingrid Krause,

15
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:46,813
and I own the Midwest Microcar
Museum in Mazomanie, Wisconsin.

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,550
- Attendee 5: Holy cow,

17
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,385
the whole roof flips over
on this one.

18
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,120
- You'll see, it is made
for adults,

19
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,323
except once you try...
- Oh, dear! [both laughing]

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,659
This thing is right in the way.

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,194
- It's picture time!

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,230
- Now, do you want to jump
back out again, or?

23
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,998
We started with the
Messerschmitt.

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,668
- Dave, come and help me
get out!

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,069
[all laughing]

26
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,738
- Ingrid: The Messerschmitt
is a funny-looking car.

27
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,574
It's a fun car.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,310
It's a sort of a nostalgia.

29
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,213
This is my East German corner.

30
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,581
I grew up in Germany.

31
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,349
Post World War II,

32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,186
there were hundreds
of small car manufacturers.

33
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:30,290
You have to realize, after the
war, Europe was in shambles.

34
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,193
And so people were just happy
to have something.

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,697
There too, we have the
motorcycle engine in the back.

36
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,900
You'll see it.
- Attendee 6: Whoa.

37
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,736
[engine popping]

38
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,439
Driving one wheel.

39
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:46,807
Wow.

40
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,675
- You don't really buy 'em
as an investment.

41
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,943
You buy 'em
because they're funny,

42
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,913
and we kind of got
a kick out of it.

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,550
And then it got to be a hobby
gone rogue.

44
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,852
We liked the building.

45
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,788
We just wanted
to store the vehicles.

46
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,624
Then everybody said,
"Oh, come on.

47
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,427
Just open up so everybody else
can see it too."

48
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,662
We thought it was fun.

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,532
And now, I just open
when I feel like opening.

50
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,100
- Attendee 7: That's nice.

51
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,869
- Ingrid: I like the
interactions with people.

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,037
I think it's fun.

53
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,574
I have met very nice people
all along.

54
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,910
This is the Trabant.

55
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,113
We kind of like
goofy-looking cars,

56
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,850
and to be honest,
they're all goofy-looking.

57
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,920
And you get a smile
on your face.

58
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,721
- Thank you for coming.
- It was fun.

59
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,123
- Yeah.

60
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,725
And if you have a smile on your
face just looking at those,

61
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,894
there's something right
about it.

62
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,629
[bright music]

63
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,099
