00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,770
- Bridget McCutcheon:
I grew up on a farm

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,439
in northern Wisconsin.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:10,310
I like to joke I was raised
in a field by cows and a dog.

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,748
Part of it's a joke
and part of it is reality.

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,984
- Angela Fitzgerald:
In August 2022,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,520
Bridget McCutchen set out
from Ashland...

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,687
- Jeff McCutchen: Goodbye,
Bridget!

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,556
- Angela: ...attempting to set
a world record

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,659
as the youngest person
to circumnavigate the world

10
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,394
on a motorcycle.

11
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,631
[bright guitar music]

12
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,934
- Bridget: I mean,
it's a beautiful world,

13
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,903
and I wanna go see it.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,173
That's a big part of it,

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,142
is just wanting to go
see the world.

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,343
- Angela: Bridget took with her

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,446
an abundance of curiosity
and ambition.

18
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,848
- Bridget: Riding a motorcycle,
to me,

19
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,950
is the best thing in the world.

20
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:54,755
And it gives you a sense
of freedom and independence.

21
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,091
- Angela: Fourteen months later,
[motorcycle revving]

22
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,794
with her newfound freedom
and independence,

23
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,431
Bridget throttled back into the
town where the journey began.

24
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,333
[people applauding and cheering]

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,403
- And we're so happy you're here
to celebrate Bridget's return.

26
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,771
- Oh, my goodness!

27
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,873
Okay, well, I'm alive, I'm fine.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,176
I'm excited to rest,
and honestly,

29
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,613
eat food that is very familiar.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,814
- Angela: At the starting line,

31
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,016
no one could have predicted
the outcome.

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,585
Least of all Bridget,

33
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,722
who rewatched the interview she
recorded just prior to leaving.

34
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,459
- I think it's going to start
out with completing the trip

35
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,927
and getting the record,

36
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,464
and I would not be surprised
by the end of it

37
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,902
if it is completely different,
because I guarantee you,

38
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,104
I will not be the same person
when I come back,

39
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,574
and my values would have
changed.

40
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,211
So, that's gonna change.
[chuckling]

41
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,981
Wow!

42
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,285
[upbeat electronic music]

43
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,056
- Angela: After logging about
50,000 miles

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,492
and traversing 45 countries,

45
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,662
Bridget did come back
a changed person.

46
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,330
- Bridget: The riding
for long hours

47
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,332
gave me a lot of time to think.

48
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,535
I think I've become
a lot calmer.

49
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,570
I think a lot of things
don't bother me

50
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,405
the same way they used to.

51
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,140
I am in the desert.

52
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,877
This is the desert I am in.

53
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,880
I feel way more certain of
myself than I did previously,

54
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,116
and I think that's a big,
big deal.

55
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:34,188
So I've stopped for the night,
and this is my camp spot.

56
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,724
- Angela: That's not to say
she wasn't uncertain

57
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,660
or frightened during the trip.

58
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,895
- There were times
when I was scared.

59
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,831
I think fear is very healthy.

60
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,602
It tells you when your
situations are dangerous.

61
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,170
- Angela: When asked
the driving factor

62
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,839
that got her through it all...

63
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,707
[Bridget grunting]

64
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,577
- Bridget: Stubbornness, mostly.
[laughing]

65
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,412
I think that was a huge part
of it,

66
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,980
is once I get ahold
of something,

67
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,650
I'm a hold of it and it's not
going anywhere.

68
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:08,956
So, I think just holding onto
that idea really kept me going.

69
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,290
[laughing]

70
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,125
- Angela: The gravity
of her accomplishment

71
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,927
is still setting in.

72
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,197
I just thought about that.

73
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,932
Um...

74
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,636
Pretty cool.

75
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,273
Y'know, I'm very happy
I'm going home,

76
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,109
but I'm gonna miss this.

77
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,314
I am going to miss this
a whole bunch!

78
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,417
And that I did that
was pretty awesome.

79
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,152
I am in Nepal!

80
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,122
For the rest of the winter,

81
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,692
sort of be figuring out
what I'm doing next.

82
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,663
And, y'know, sort of getting
things done.

83
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,168
I wanna go back
to working on boats

84
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,905
and, like, doing
other stuff like that.

85
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,478
I'm not exactly sure,
but I have some things in mind.

86
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,947
No big adventures planned yet.

87
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,082
- Angela: Driven to succeed
on an adventure

88
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,785
that took her to all corners
of the world.

89
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,655
- I am in the forest in Germany.

90
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:23,297
And I really want to inspire
other young women like myself

91
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,265
to ride motorcycles.

92
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,067
- Angela: Mission accomplished,
Bridget!

93
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,436
With an inspiring story that
landed her

94
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:33,073
in the Guinness Book
of World Records.

95
