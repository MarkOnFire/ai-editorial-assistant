most magnificent homes.

it's a family of status.

>> Built in the 19th and
early 20th centuries,

00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,493
these houses continue to inspire
our modern imagination.

an American architecture

here in the prairies
of the Midwest.

And why are they still here

after so many generations?
I'm Michael Bridgeman,

12

architecture my entire life.

six of these grand homes

They have their own

unique designs,
and each of them holds

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,622
an incredible story.
>> He brought a mindset

00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,858
to this house that
was really revolutionary.

on the shores of Geneva Lake
in southeastern Wisconsin.

29
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,776
The home has been restored to
its greatness of a century ago.

30
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,046
The massive restoration project,
completed just before

31
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,984
the new millennium, was led by
architect, John Nelson.

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,054
>> It was a very intense
construction period.

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,892
I mean, there were times
when there were over

34
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,028
a hundred workers on the site.
>> The home was originally

35
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:11,398
constructed in 1905,
at a time when a number of

36
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,201
the region's high society
were building country estates

37
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,371
in Lake Geneva.
Most of these movers and shakers

38
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,541
were from Chicago.
They came to the lakes

39
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,577
of Southern Wisconsin
to enjoy their beauty,

40
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,314
to maintain social status,
and to get away from a city

41
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,417
going through unprecedented
change.

42
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,719
?
Chicago was America's

43
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,059
fastest-growing city
in the 19th century.

44
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:43,630
In 1850, its population was
below thirty thousand people.

45
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,366
In just 50 years, that number
was fast approaching

46
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,403
two million.
And living in cities

47
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,973
at this time
could be downright unpleasant.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,242
>> The streets were filled
with horse manure.

49
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,545
There was soot and smoke
in the air.

50
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,784
Cities were swept by disease
like cholera, typhoid.

51
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,053
all the information
Cities were regarded as places

52
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,623
that were not healthful.
>> Lake Geneva offered

53
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,593
a striking contrast
to life in Chicago,

54
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,562
enticing some of its wealthiest
people to vacation there

55
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,699
in the summer.
The earliest would come

57

>> The Great Fire of Chicago
began on Sunday, October 8,

58
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,578
in 1871.
By the time it was extinguished

59
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,082
two days later, it had claimed
at least three hundred lives and

60
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,619
destroyed the heart of the city.
>> The wealthy don't want to

61
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,955
live among the ruins of Chicago
while it's being rebuilt.

62
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,624
So they temporarily take
community.

63
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,628
residence up in Lake Geneva,
and they establish this

tradition of living in these
grand estates that surround

that damage information,

Norman Harris is just one of
a long line of Chicago people

67
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,072
who make it a vacation
destination.

and philanthropist,

Norman Wait Harris,

70
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,414
made his fortune in insurance
and banking.

71
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,484
Harris hired a renowned Boston
architecture firm to design his

here, FEMA will make the

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,322
And it had to be prestigious,
something worthy

74
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,157
president. The president
of Harris's stature.

75
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,760
whether a disaster
>> There's a long tradition,

76
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,497
really, of architecture being
used to express status.

77
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,866
And so what we see in Wisconsin
in a lot of these buildings

78
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,502
in the late 19th and
early 20th century

79
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,038
are the desire on the part of
its wealthiest citizens

80
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,640
to express power.
And it was on the architecture

81
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,577
itself, on the exterior
of these buildings

82
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,179
as well as on the interiors.
They wanted to show that they

83
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,616
were keeping up with
the Joneses, so to speak.

84
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,519
>> Harris named his home
Wadsworth Hall

85
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,789
to honor his mother's family
and his New England roots.

86
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,358
And Harris chose a style
for this retreat

87
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:55,896
cross responded to
that suited his self-image.

88
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,867
>> It's a terrific example
of what you'd call

89
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,036
Colonial Revival Period
architecture.

90
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,540
>> It's an architecture
of American patriotism.

91
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,077
The architectural vocabulary
is drawn from American

92
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,381
revolutionary culture.
And the owners of Wadsworth Hall

93
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:18,552
are saying, we are Americans.
Our success has come from

94
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:22,489
the success of America itself.
So we picked an architectural

95
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:26,994
style that's expressive of
the growth and success

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,964
of American culture.
>> Wadsworth Hall has

97
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,701
a noble colonial style
on its exterior.

98
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,739
But things change
on the inside of the home.

99
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,474
?
most.

100
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,679
>> Here all the rooms
are slightly different.

101
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,815
They're not totally out of place
in a Colonial building.

102
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,852
They feel like they belong in
there, but they're not strictly

103
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,656
period architecture.
>> For Norman Harris and his

104
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,792
contemporaries in Lake Geneva,
using different styles

105
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,996
was a conscious choice.
A good example of this

106
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:07,334
is the library.
>> The style of the library

107
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,938
is much more classical.
He's saying something about

108
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:15,642
himself as a learned, educated
person that he couldn't say

109
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,246
using the architectural style
of house itself.

110
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,715
>> In a Colonial building
you wouldn't have

111
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,618
a coved ceiling such as we do
in the room that we're

112
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:29,456
sitting in right now.
>> That room is the great room,

113
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:34,728
the heart of Wadsworth Hall.
It's punctuated by a magnificent

114
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,532
staircase and chandelier.
And it leads out to the terrace

115
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,069
and Geneva Lake.
>> If, as in many cases

116
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,105
in the old days,
you arrived by boat,

117
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,842
you would have actually come in
through the doors behind me,

118
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,912
rather than through
the motor court in front.

119
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,450
So this would be your
introduction to the house.

120
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,053
>> One of the great room's
primary purposes

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,123
was to entertain
large groups of people.

122
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,692
And by the turn of the century,
Lake Geneva had a vibrant

123
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,196
Chicago party scene
during the summers.

124
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:13,133
These extravagant affairs
were serious business.

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,470
>> Partying was definitely
part of that culture.

126
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,039
So if you didn't have a party,
you weren't among the people

127
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,443
who were the status people,
the image seekers.

128
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,050
>> At Wadsworth Hall,
simply walking from the interior

129
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,820
to the outdoors
has a magical feeling to it.

130
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,389
For example, the sun room,
needed most.

131
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,425
with its lovely view
of the lake to the south,

132
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:42,529
has a surprise in store
for those who venture outside.

133
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,399
A semi-circular portico
creates a graceful transition

134
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,936
from the house to the outdoors.
And then this allée

135
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,139
of beech trees draws the eye
further into the landscape.

136
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,108
?
The original landscaping was

137
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,016
done by the Olmstead brothers.
They were the sons of

138
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,519
Frederick Law Olmstead,
America's most famous

139
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,822
landscape architect.
Much of the Olmstead brothers'

140
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,492
framework has been preserved.
>> Now it's been altered

141
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,162
over the years,
but there's enough of

142
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,565
the basic intent there that is
really a landmark landscape

143
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:22,202
as well as an architectural
landmark.

144
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,205
>> To explore the grounds
of Wadsworth Hall,

145
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,275
is to be rewarded.
For example,

146
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,945
there's a children's play area.

147
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,882
It includes bite-sized buildings
and is hedged by a charming

148
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,652
topiary sculpture.
This village was added

149
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,689
as part of the restoration
done at Wadsworth Hall in 1999.

150
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,158
The restoration was completed
for home-owner

151
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,195

and philanthropist.

153
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,166
When Richard Driehaus
bought the house,

154
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,136
the dining room ceiling
was sagging badly.

155
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,206
The architects devised
a careful plan to secure it

156
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,476
from above, and slowly pull
the elaborate plasterwork

157
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,211
back into place.
?

158
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,251
>> It had, over the years
slipped, and miraculously

159
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,555
didn't start cracking
or falling apart.

160
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,758
Most of the plasterwork in there
is the original, and once

161
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,660
we got it secured again,
interest.

162
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,728
it only took a coat of paint
about the immigration

163
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,465
to bring it back.
>> Today, the home is in

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,802
exquisite condition,
a testament to its masterful

165
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,139
renovation.
Wadsworth Hall holds

166
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:37,077
a special place among
Wisconsin's remarkable homes.

167
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,848
>> It's really a house that
reflects the trends at the time

168
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,383
of the upper class;
the way they lived,

169
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,986
the business history,
the social history,

170
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,923
the cultural history.
For all of those reasons,

171
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,993
the house should be preserved.
?

172
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,103
?
>> This home in Neenah

173
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,210
was a very personal project
for Havilah Babcock.

174
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,280
He was one of the founders of
the Kimberly-Clark Corporation

175
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:17,551
and built his fashionable house
on East Wisconsin Avenue.

176
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,420
Havilah Babcock supervised
every aspect of construction

177
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,390
that went into
his family's home.

178
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,093
>> My great-grandfather
built this,

179
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,563
and it was a labor of love.
I mean, this was a whole focus

180
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,300
of his private life.
>> Because the home

181
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,203
has remained with the family
to this day,

182
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,772
it is unique.
It's story revolves around

183
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,742
a man who built success
from humble beginnings,

184
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,678
and constructed his house
as a form of self-expression.

185
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,647
?
Havilah Babcock's

186
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,954
fascination with building
began when he was a boy.

187
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,524
He worked with his father
on the Neenah lock.

188
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:01,028
Then in his teens, Babcock got
a job at a dry goods store

189
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:05,132
and advanced quickly.
>> He grew to be quite tall

190
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,668
and good-looking,
and dry goods was all about

191
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:12,306
selling dress fabrics to women.
And he could sell them

192
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,708
all kinds of stuff
on that principle of having

193
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:18,579
good-looking clerks serve women
in dress goods.

194
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,181
>> Within a few short years,
Babcock and his friend,

195
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:25,085
Alfred Kimberly, started
their own dry goods store.

196
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,322
A local newspaper attested
that young Havilah was

197
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,458
"a great favorite with the
ladies" and went on to predict

198
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:36,530
that women would not fail to
shop at his newly-opened store.

199
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:40,934
Babcock was just 19 years old.
Havilah Babcock

200
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,840
and Alfred Kimberly
were ambitious entrepreneurs.

201
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,177
They partnered with
F.C. Shattuck and C.B. Clark

202
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,779
in 1872, forming what would
become one of the largest

203
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,582
paper companies in the world.
Kimberly Clark and Company

204
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,218
would make Babcock
a wealthy man.

205
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,121
But at a price.
>> He and Alfred Kimberly,

206
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,424
his partner,
had to sell the store,

207
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,394
which was Havilah's great joy.
I mean, it was the thing

208
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,230
he really liked doing
and did very well at.

209
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,533
>> But it didn't take
Babcock long to find

210
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,468
a new way to channel
his artistic energy.

211
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,937
community. And they
He set out to build his family

212
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:19,940
a grand home.
And because of his background

213
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,143
in construction and fashion,
Babcock was perfectly

214
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,847
suited for the task.
He hired prominent Oshkosh

215
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,550
architect, William Waters,
who drew up a Queen Anne style

216
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,786
house.
The family moved into their

217
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,256
new home in 1883.
But it would take Babcock

218
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,992
several more years
to complete the interior

219
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,864
to satisfy his taste and style
and to tell his story.

220
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,734
she has the color of skin
>> Architecture in

221
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,504
the 19th century
was seen as didactic.

222
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:54,241
It was a learning tool.
In the Babcock house,

223
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:58,445
they're using certain motifs
to say something about

224
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,781
what they valued
and what they believed

225
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,051
and what their culture
was all about.

226
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,354
>> Victorian America emphasized
the virtues of family life.

227
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,390
And the home,
more than anyplace else,

228
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,694
is where character was formed.
Havilah Babcock integrated

229
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,231
moral lessons into
the fabric of his new house.

230
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,300
?
Storytelling imagery abounds

231
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:28,308
throughout the home.
Socrates, Dante and Lord Byron

232
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,979
argue their philosophies
in the library.

233
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,249
In the front hall,
the perils of unbridled lust

234
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,720
are cautioned through depictions
of Lancelot and Guinevere.

235
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,456
And, with a hint of
self-deprecation,

236
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:46,493
Havilah Babcock also
shared stories about himself.

237
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,962
>> At the vestibule doors
in the front hall,

238
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,831
you have a peacock
how many people they've

239
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,400
and a pheasant.
The peacock and the pheasant

240
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:56,203
are both birds where the male
is more ornamental

241
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,106
than the female.
And, this is kind of

242
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,010
a reflection of his character.
In the transom over these doors,

243
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,013
is a parakeet.
The parakeet is a bird in which

244
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,751
the sex is identified by
the male's ability to sing

245
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,521
which the female does not.
And Havilah was a tenor

246
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:18,759
in the church choir and
a semi-professional singer.

247
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,161
He's telling you a little bit
about himself, and it's really

248
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,631
rather intriguing.
>> Havilah included a tribute

249
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:28,001
to his wife, Frances.
The goddess Pomona overlooking

250
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,871
the front hall stairs
bears something of a resemblance

251
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,508
to Mrs. Babcock.
Life in the late 1800s

252
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,916
in a high-status home like
Havilah Babcock's was strictly

253
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:46,086
regimented by the different
zones of the house.

254
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,156
?
>> These are perceived as being

255
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,660
these very large houses.
And they are, but the lives were

256
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,596
not spreading out wide and far.
difficult. There are maybe

257
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,932
They were rely very much
circumscribed

258
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,702
into smaller areas.
>> The Victorian house

259
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:06,340
was indeed a highly organized,
contrived space.

260
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,977
There were male spaces of
the house like the library,

261
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,679
which was where
the man of the house could read,

262
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,115
but was also a space
where he could showcase

263
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,885
his worldly knowledge.
Whereas women essentially had

264
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,321
a sitting room, perhaps,
where they would entertain.

265
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,391
?
>> There was one room, however,

266
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:30,264
that the entire Babcock family
certainly shared together.

267
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,168
>> The dining room was really,
for them,

268
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:38,338
the center of family life.
The ritual of dining was huge.

269
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,575
Meals were served in courses,
it was the best china,

270
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:45,812
crystal, tablecloths.
And so it was this very elegant,

271
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,685
very stately type of experience.
>> The Havilah Babcock House

272
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,455
was built during a time
of rapid technological

273
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,659
advancement.
It was the first home in Neenah

274
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:02,729
to be wired for electricity.
But with a boiler used for

275
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,333
heating, why did it have
so many of these?

276
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,970
This was a modern home.
It was warmed with central heat,

277
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,340
yet fireplaces appear
in every room.

278
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,076
A practical backup system
to be sure.

279
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:20,814
But also a tangible reminder
of the family hearth.

280
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,984
The fireplaces in Babcock's home
were decorative

281
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:27,087
and most of them
were never used.

282
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,356
>> It was one of those things
that were put in because

283
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:32,492
it just made you feel
more comfortable.

284
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,395
There were ducts built in
the walls to take the heat up

285
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,131
to the second floor,
so that when it came to

286
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,400
converting to forced air
it was very easy for us.

287
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,337
We thank him for that.
>> Havilah Babcock's

288
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,240
great-grandson, Peter Adams,
now lives in this home

289
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,042
with his wife, Patricia Mulvey.
It has remained in the family

290
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:52,446
more than a century
after Havilah's death

291
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:56,283
and is remarkably unchanged,
thanks to two of his daughters.

292
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,853
>> After Havilah died,
his wife stayed on

293
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,589
and ultimately it was just
Helen and Elizabeth,

294
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,324
error not the machines.
the oldest and the youngest,

295
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,327
who made this their home.
They were terrified of changing

296
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,297
anything that Father did
because it was all-important

297
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,066
to him, it was an embodiment
of him.

298
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,336
And we just ended up
doing the same.

299
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,006
>> And this is why
Havilah Babcock's house

300
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,808
remains so true to its past.
His descendants simply

301
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,379
did not make changes.
So the extra-long couch

302
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:30,350
in which tall Havilah took naps
still beckons in its spot.

303
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:34,788
The unique tufted dado in
the parlor remains intact.

304
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:38,325
And the ornate library ceiling
continues to attest to

305
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,393
Havilah Babcock's design
mail out absentee ballots

306
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,929
sensibility.
All as it was

307
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:47,968
some 125 years ago.
An incredible family treasure,

308
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:51,805
and something of an inspiration.
>> Throughout Wisconsin,

309
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,541
throughout the U.S.
for that matter,

310
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,779
there are people who, every day,
lose beloved family homes.

311
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:01,748
They don't know what to do.
They don't think it's possible.

312
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:06,286
The reality is you can do it.
And you don't necessarily have

313
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:10,224
to have a pile of money, because
this didn't come with any money.

314
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,127
This was just the house.
You just have to develop a plan.

315
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,597
We've been here
forty-some years,

316
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,466
so we've made it work.
It has not been easy.

317
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,870
It's been a lot of hard work.
>> Today Babcock's house

318
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,607
gives us an authentic glimpse
into the world of

319
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,776
wealthy Victorians in Wisconsin.
And the home remains

320
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,913
a captivating expression of
the colorful, handsome man

321
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,315
named Havilah Babcock.

322
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,094
?
On an island

323
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,133
in the Mississippi River
at Prairie du Chien,

324
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,237
sits a Wisconsin gem.
It's called Villa Louis.

325
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,073
Open to the public, it's now
a museum run by the Wisconsin

326
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,810
Historical Society.
>> Villa Louis is one of

327
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,046
the premier historic house
museums in the country.

328
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,382
Nearly 90 percent of
the collection is original to

329
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,718
the family and to the household
here in Prairie du Chien.

330
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,688
>> That means much of what's
inside this house is well over

331
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:18,425
one hundred years old.
And the story of the family

332
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,761
who built Villa Louis
is as dramatic

333
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,930
election.
as the setting itself.

334
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,665
?
?

335
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,306
>> Hercules Dousman came to
Prairie du Chien in 1826

336
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,108
to work for
the American Fur Company.

337
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,444
But the fur trade was
just a few years away from

338
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,714
a total collapse.
>> Hercules is one of

339
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,850
the lucky ones.
He's able to take money he made

340
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,352
off of the fur trade
and reinvested,

341
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,555
mainly in land speculation.
>> Land investments

342
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:52,125
made Hercules Dousman one of
Wisconsin's wealthiest men.

343
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,661
He built a grand home whose
entrance led up from

344
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,764
the Mississippi River.
Built on high ground,

345
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:01,368
Hercules named it
the Brick House on the Mound.

346
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,804
>> He lives in the home here
with his wife Jane until

347
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,007
he dies in September of 1868.
At the time of his death,

348
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,343
it leaves his widow Jane and
the one son that they had

349
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,912
who's always referred to
as Louis.

350
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,548
And Louis then decides
that this first home that

351
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,551
he's living in with his mother
isn't modern enough.

352
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,353
?
>> Hercules' son, Louis Dousman,

353
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,890
administrator of those
was just 20 years old.

354
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,293
But he was wealthy, ambitious,
and wanted a new home

355
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,229
fitting of his station.
So he sought out the most

356
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,299
prestigious architect
money could buy.

357
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:35,769
>> Edward Townsend Mix was
the most prominent architect

358
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:39,439
in the state of Wisconsin.
He was the status architect.

359
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:42,176
And people were hiring him
because they knew that they'd

360
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:46,747
get something worthy of their
place in the world.

361
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,082
>> Less than 30 years
after its construction,

362
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,385
the spectacular
Brick House on the Mound

363
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,588
was torn down.
Louis built his new home

364
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,524
on the same spot.
But it was mostly his mother,

365
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,128
Jane, who resided there.
Louis' ambitions led him away

366
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:05,232
from the state.
By the time he returned to

367
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,268
his Prairie du Chien mansion,
he had a beautiful wife, Nina,

368
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:11,471
and five children.
And Louis and Nina Dousman

369
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:15,676
were about to launch
an extraordinary plan.

370
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:21,748
Villa Louis is a prime example
of an elegant Victorian home.

371
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:24,384
In the latter half of
the 19th century,

372
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,654
interiors for wealthy families
like the Dousmans

373
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,991
were marked by highly ornamental
wall and floor coverings,

374
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,627
objects and art
on prominent display,

375
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,597
and rich colors.
But you had to be careful

376
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,666
where you stepped.
In the 1880s,

377
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,769
<i>Harper's Bazaar</i> magazine
acknowledged that the latest

378
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:46,073
taste could be...
"...a little overcrowded,

379
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,443
scarcely giving rest enough
to the eye or mind..."

380
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,113
But went on to add, "It is
crowded only with beauty."

381
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,183
?
>> When you tour the home today,

382
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,789
you see these beautiful
blues and reds and golds.

383
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,392
And they flow throughout
the house in all the textiles

384
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,095
and prints and furniture and
Mrs. Dousman had upholstered.

385
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,163
?
some complexities.

386
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,411
>> Villa Louis is filled with
colorful ornamentation

387
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:27,080
everywhere you look.
Today, it's preserved to its

388
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:31,318
Victorian grandeur in the 1880s.
And the catalyst for

389
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:34,688
the striking style of this home
came from an unlikely source.

390
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,557
[horse whinnies]
?

391
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,730
In 1883, Louis undertook
a bold and exciting new venture,

392
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:47,267
a stock farm for breeding
and racing trotting horses.

393
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,870
Knowing she'd be entertaining
an influx of eager

394
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:53,273
horse investors,
Mrs. Dousman felt it was time

395
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,109
for an upgrade.
>> She wants to add her own

396
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,846
sense of style and flair
to this house and they start

397
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:02,015
this remodeling process
in this real British

398
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:05,018
Arts and Crafts style.
>> Arts and crafts was about

399
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:08,121
embracing the values of
hand crafted goods

400
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:11,325
while understanding that
machines produced goods.

401
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,127
So rather than to make it
look machine-like,

402
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:17,598
they tried to make it look
craftsman-like.

403
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:21,368
And that's the aesthetic
that the Dousmans are borrowing

404
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:27,474
when they redesign their house.
>> But Louis Dousman did not

405
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,844
get much time to enjoy
his home's transformation.

406
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:34,581
Just a couple of years later,
he became ill.

407
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,017
>> They're not sure what's
wrong with him.

408
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,419
He's complaining of these pains.
He dies from appendicitis.

409
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:42,189
Louis's only 37 years old,
and that left his wife, Nina,

410
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,392
a widow at 33 with five young
children.

411
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,761
>> In the Victorian age,
Mrs. Dousman's options

412
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,831
were limited.
It was considered improper

413
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:53,100
for a woman to speak about
the racing and breeding

414
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,537
of animals,
so she had to sell off the stock

415
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:00,007
and close out Louis' farm.
And she was expected to mourn

416
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:03,744
her husband's death
for two and a half years.

417
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,714
>> There was tremendous pressure
on women in Victorian America.

418
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,517
Those expectations were
socially in place.

419
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,986
They were also codified in
the extensive advice literature

420
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,756
about what women
were supposed to do.

421
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,125
And these were enumerated.
There were roles

422
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,494
that were listed one by one
in those books

423
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:24,464
about expectations.
>> After an unsuccessful

424
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,267
second marriage,
Mrs. Dousman refocused her

425
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:32,339
attention on her children.
>> Her oldest daughter is 19,

426
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,775
her second oldest daughter
is 18.

427
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:36,777
It's now time to find
prospective husbands.

428
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:39,046
She's doing it
as a single woman.

429
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,381
And in society
she's a wealthy woman.

430
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:44,117
She's considered
a beautiful woman.

431
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:47,654
And that's a challenge to others
when it comes to entertaining.

432
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,656
Who wants this wealthy,
single woman sitting

433
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:53,160
next to your husband
at a dinner party?

434
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,129
>> Nina now called the estate
Villa Louis in tribute to

435
00:24:56,196 --> 00:25:00,200
her late husband.
And by the summer of 1894,

436
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:03,203
her children were enjoying
a vibrant social life of parties

437
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,939
held at the home.
But these happy times

438
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,309
something that's really
would not last long.

439
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,479
>> Mrs. Dousman's middle child,
Nina Sturgis Dousman, was

440
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:15,282
getting ready for a house party.
She was curling her hair,

441
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,885
as girls do,
and the curling iron was like

442
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:23,090
ours of today, but had to be
heated up over a heat source.

443
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:26,193
>> Kerosene lamps were
a common fixture in homes

444
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,697
in the late 1880s.
But they had one major flaw,

445
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:34,201
when conditions were just right,
the whole lamp could explode.

446
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:36,603
?
An explosion did occur.

447
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,474
And by the time her mother
identify what academic

448
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,709
extinguished the blaze
with a quilt,

449
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:46,246
14 year-old Nina Dousman
was horribly burned.

450
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,916
>> She was cared for
for six weeks at the house

451
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,818
and infection set in.
They weren't quite sure how to

452
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:55,522
treat burns like this back then.
She dies on September 14th,

453
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:59,226
1894.
The family closes up the house

454
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,695
and they go up to St. Paul
for the winter.

455
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,897
And that's something that
Mrs. Dousman continues

456
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,133
to do every year,
not celebrating Christmas

457
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,871
here in Prairie du Chien.
>> But the Dousman family

458
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,712
continued to return to
Villa Louis every summer.

459
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,982
Mrs. Dousman loved entertaining,
and the home was

460
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:26,286
a perfect setting for parties.
Its striking glass veranda

461
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:29,890
provided an excellent spot
for indoor fun.

462
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:32,192
>> It's an extended space
where they can sit and enjoy

463
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,761
themselves in the evening hours,
but be protected from

464
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:37,464
the Mississippi mosquitoes.
They played card games.

465
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,833
At one point,
there's a pump organ out there.

466
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,336
as the federal government
>> The veranda was an ideal

467
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:45,739
focal point for house parties.
And the Dousman women were

468
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:48,942
having as much fun
as their male counterparts.

469
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,111
>> They just weren't having
teas and sitting straight

470
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:53,847
in the parlor.
They were golfing,

471
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:57,050
they were playing archery,
they were shooting guns.

472
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,253
>> Summer parties at
Villa Louis were not

473
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,422
one-day affairs.
Many friends were staying

474
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:06,193
at the home and nearby hotels
for weeks at a time,

475
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,862
possibly at the peril
of their waistlines.

476
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,133
>> Mrs. Dousman loved to dine.
She loved to dine elegantly.

477
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,303
And you get a sense of that when
you see the dining room table.

478
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,906
>> One particular guest gave
compelling testament

479
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,642
to the bountiful food
at Villa Louis.

480
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,278
>> Frederick Bigalow,
his name shows up

481
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,880
in the guest book quite often.
And one passage that he writes

482
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:30,150
talks about how he gained "seven
pounds, three quarters net"

483
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:34,988
during one week's house party.
>> Mrs. Dousman's plan for her

484
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:38,825
daughters was right on course.
With no expense spared,

485
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:41,495
these summer-long parties
were attracting plenty

486
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:44,364
of eligible bachelors.
There was only one problem,

487
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,901
Nina Dousman
was running out of cash.

488
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:52,706
>> The wealth is lagging.
And with the depression in 1893

489
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:56,043
we start to see the coffers are
being depleted a little bit.

490
00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:00,714
And so she's working on finding
these matches so that her family

491
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,116
can continue to keep the same
status that they've been used to

492
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:06,086
all of their lives.
>> Mrs. Dousman's parties

493
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,889
paid off.
For example, one guest,

494
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,291
Frederick Bigalow,
the suitor who wrote that

495
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,927
he gained seven pounds
and three quarter net,

496
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,830
married the second daughter,
Virginia.

497
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:19,733
A magnificent and dramatic era
for the Dousmans

498
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,203
came to a close.
>> By 1913, the children are

499
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,306
married, the house is in need
of some repairs,

500
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,409
and it's not really
fashionable any longer

501
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:33,213
to have such a grand estate.
>> Mrs. Dousman, her son Louis

502
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,883
and his family,
moved out of Villa Louis

503
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:39,820
for good in 1913.
They leased the home to a boys

504
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,156
school, but voided the contract
after four years.

505
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,293
The boys were simply too rough
on the house.

506
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,829
A solution for the property
was finally reached when

507
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,198
the Dousman family
turned it over to the city of

508
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:55,969
Prairie du Chien in 1935.
Fifteen years later,

509
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:59,206
the Wisconsin Historical Society
took ownership

510
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,776
and made Villa Louis
its first historic site.

511
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:05,879
Today, the home is open
to the public.

512
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:10,150
It's been painstakingly restored
to its splendor in the 1880s.

513
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:12,986
Villa Louis magnificently
captures the grandeur of

514
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:17,624
the Victorian era,
and the drama of the Dousmans.

515
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,934
?
An hour's drive

516
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,505
north of Eau Claire
is a small island

517
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:35,709
on Red Cedar Lake.
It's called Stout Island.

518
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:40,781
There, nestled among the trees,
is a unique summer lodge.

519
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,016
>> What our guests
talk about most is that this

520
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,887
is the first time in their life
they relaxed.

521
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:49,189
They're not checking their phone
to see who e-mailed them

522
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:51,258
or who texted them.
They leave it in the room.

523
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,327
They don't think about it.
They think about

524
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:55,829
who they're with.
>> Stout's Island Lodge

525
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,898
was originally
a private vacation home

526
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,133
that Frank Stout built
for his family.

527
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,403
He called it
the Island of Happy Days.

528
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,039
And it was certainly that,
even though at one point Stout

529
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,775
had to burn it to the ground.
?

530
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:17,084
Frank Stout was a financier
and banker in Chicago,

531
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,721
but his wealth was rooted
in Wisconsin forests.

532
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:23,257
His father helped make
Knapp, Stout and Company

533
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:27,160
one of the world's largest
lumber providers.

534
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:30,364
>> Northern Wisconsin
was covered with virgin timber,

535
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,666
and the king of all that timber
was white pine.

536
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,469
It was like gold
to these early lumbermen.

537
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:38,739
These trees were huge,
five, six feet in diameter.

538
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:41,608
And that's where the fortune
really was.

539
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,178
>> Frank Stout inherited
a portion of his father's

540
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:48,115
vast wealth in 1900.
That included this island

541
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,051
on Red Cedar Lake.
And Stout decided it would be

542
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:56,256
perfect for his vacation home.
The Island of Happy Days

543
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:02,462
was completed in 1903.
Frank Stout and his family

544
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:06,333
traveled there from Chicago
every summer.

545
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,303
He had a special track built
off the main railroad line

546
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:13,373
to get family, guests and
supplies to Red Cedar Lake.

547
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,876
Then from water's edge,
everything had to arrive

548
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,278
by boat.
[engine starts]

549
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:25,252
>> Today, the shuttle ride
is just a leisurely

550
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,721
ten minutes to Stout Island.
And the charms of the lodge

551
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:31,692
are on display as soon as
the boat approaches the dock.

552
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,994
>> The boathouse is one of
the areas that gets

553
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,463
the most attention.
It's the first moment of,

554
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,800
ahh, kind of magic.
Because there's not a lot of

555
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:43,470
these kind of boathouses left.
>> Up the stairs

556
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,006
from the boathouse,
the sprawling lodge beckons

557
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,942
as it did a century ago.
That is, after it was completely

558
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:50,677
rebuilt.
?

559
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:58,585
Frank Stout modeled
the Island of Happy Days,

560
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:01,655
which refers to the home
as well as the island itself,

561
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:06,226
on the famous Adirondack
great camps in upstate New York.

562
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,729
These compounds were
summer getaway homes

563
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:11,465
for the wealthy.
And Stout wanted his home

564
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:14,968
to be especially rustic.
>> Frank Stout, when he

565
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:18,172
built this, insisted that
the bark be left on the wood.

566
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:21,074
Within a few years, his house
became infested with bugs.

567
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:24,945
And he was forced to burn
his house down.

568
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,047
He wanted to rebuild on the same
homestead, but also he needed to

569
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:30,184
get rid of the bugs.
So, he spent

570
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,921
1.5 million dollars,
at that time, to do this.

571
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,456
>> That means Stout used
the equivalent of approximately

572
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:39,760
36 million in today's dollars
to rebuild

573
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:42,896
The Island of Happy Days.
It was enough to buy

574
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,866
the best of the best.
And that's exactly

575
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:51,205
what Frank Stout did.
When Stout rebuilt the lodge,

576
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:54,208
he brought in wood and stone
from around the country

577
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:57,110
and around the world.
In the great room,

578
00:32:57,177 --> 00:33:00,881
he kept this fireplace,
fashioned of stone quarried

579
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:06,186
at nearby Mount Hardscrabble.
>> This is a time of artsman,

580
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:09,056
and craftsmanship.
Frank Stout brought

581
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:11,358
in pink granite from
the Blue Hills locally.

582
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:13,594
He brought in these
amazing beams from Germany

583
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,898
that are in the dining room.
>> It's very, very

584
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:22,336
finely crafted.
So even though it looks rustic,

585
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:27,407
it's the finest craftsmanship
that money could buy.

586
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:31,245
All of the hardware
is hand-wrought.

587
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,982
They built the bookcases right
into the log building itself.

588
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:39,553
They carved elaborate surrounds
around the bookcases.

589
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,023
The dining room has bow-tie ties
so the hardwood floor never

590
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,661
got cracks from the wood
swelling and shrinking.

591
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:51,265
>> All of these materials
and fine workmanship

592
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:54,768
create spaces that are inviting,
warm and cozy.

593
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:57,337
But it's outside where
the Stouts seemed to have

594
00:33:57,404 --> 00:34:00,073
their biggest adventures.
?

595
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:09,016
Frank Stout and his wife, Clara,
had five children.

596
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:11,451
The family and their guests
spent a lot of time

597
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:15,122
at their getaway home.
And they left behind plenty

598
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:18,158
of evidence that their time
on the Island of Happy Days

599
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,361
was incredibly fun.
>> We see these great pictures

600
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:24,231
of them swimming
on these huge slides

601
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:27,334
that go down into the water,
and water skiing

602
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,770
on these planks of wood.
And in the winter,

603
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:32,639
sledding down and skiing across
the snow.

604
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:36,510
I don't think they had
dull moments here.

605
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:46,053
>> The Adirondack style
emulates the rustic look

606
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,923
of a pioneer's log cabin
on a grand scale.

607
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,527
The style developed at a time
when Americans were feeling

608
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:57,164
wistful about pioneer days,
and far safer

609
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:01,101
among the elements.
>> When you were a pioneer,

610
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:03,537
and you move out to
the wilderness,

611
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,539
the wilderness was your enemy
because the wilderness

612
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:08,308
could kill you.
You could starve,

613
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,377
you could freeze to death.
After the industrial revolution,

614
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,980
technology helps us
to be more comfortable

615
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:15,249
in the natural world.
The architecture comes

616
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,918
to express that
difference in attitude,

617
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,220
where we no longer fear
the natural world,

618
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:23,857
we wish we lived
in the natural world.

619
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:26,727
>> But were the Stouts
"living in the natural world"

620
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:31,031
at the Island of Happy Days?
>> This was not roughing it,

621
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:33,500
by any stretch.
They would come with huge

622
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,837
caravans with their china and
their silver and their servants.

623
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:40,507
>> The irony about
the Adirondack style

624
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:44,011
is these are people of great
wealth and great privilege,

625
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:47,948
and they don't want to rough it.
They wanted to have the idea

626
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:50,284
that they were getting away
to the natural world,

627
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,220
but they wanted all
the amenities that they had

628
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:57,624
back in the city.
>> The Stout family spent many

629
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,529
winter holidays and summers
in the home,

630
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:05,799
until 1927,
when Frank Stout was nearing

631
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:09,236
the end of his life.
And there was only one place

632
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:12,973
he wanted to be for that.
Frank Stout developed

633
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,210
heart trouble and was determined
to return to his north woods

634
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:20,013
retreat for his final days.
But he died en route,

635
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,517
in nearby Rice Lake,
only a few miles

636
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:28,155
from what he called
"the dearest place on earth."

637
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,594
After Stout's death,
the family visited

638
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,496
the Island of Happy Days
less and less,

639
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:41,034
until selling it in 1948.
The home went through

640
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:44,738
various owners and
was abandoned for many years.

641
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,841
It was eventually purchased
in 1990 by its current owners,

642
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:51,378
who renamed it
Stout's Island Lodge.

643
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,915
It's one of America's
few remaining

644
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:58,252
original Adirondack great camps.
>> Almost none of them

645
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:01,522
are open to the public.
They are still kept as family

646
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:05,459
compounds, for the most part.
>> Today, the lodge is

647
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,362
open to the public.
And it retains all of the charm

648
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:11,098
it must have had
when it was known as

649
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:14,568
the Island of Happy Days.
>> The vistas are gorgeous.

650
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:17,237
You look internally at
the buildings and they're

651
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,774
miraculous in their architecture
and their attention to detail.

652
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:25,512
Everywhere was well thought out.
I have found nowhere that

653
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:30,717
speaks to my soul and my heart
as much as this place does.

654
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,029
?
>> Brooks Stevens

655
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:46,233
was a 28 year-old
industrial designer

656
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,404
when he built his home in 1939.
Its stark, modern look

657
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,973
was completely at odds
with the more traditional houses

658
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,044
in Stevens' upscale
suburban neighborhood.

659
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,680
>> He's making a statement.
It's almost like

660
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:03,183
Brooks Stevens personified.
He was daring people of means

661
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,819
who had already lived in
the neighborhood to rethink

662
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:09,089
what it was to be living
in a modern age.

663
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:11,391
>> Brooks Stevens approached
designing his home

664
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,428
the same way he did
designing products.

665
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:19,733
It was always about the future.
Brooks Stevens enrolled

666
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:25,539
at Cornell University in 1929
to pursue a degree

667
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:28,642
in architecture.
But when he found he was

668
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,512
more interested in
drawing cars than buildings,

669
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:35,249
he quit school.
Stevens returned to his

670
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:39,419
hometown of Milwaukee during
the worst economic downturn

671
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:43,524
in American history.
>> In the 1930s, Americans

672
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,293
are looking to the future,
because in the present,

673
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,496
you're living in the Depression.
And it's a terrible time.

674
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,032
They're looking at what
life will be when we get

675
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,768
out of the Depression.
And they see that life

676
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:59,673
influenced by the modern
inventions of science.

677
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,843
?
>> The science of aerodynamics

678
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,846
led to the age's
futuristic-looking ships,

679
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:09,716
airplanes and trains.
And to get Americans buying

680
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:14,454
again, manufacturers applied
this look of aerodynamic design,

681
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:19,293
or streamlining, to products.
This was where Brooks Stevens

682
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,062
found his niche when he started
his industrial design business

683
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:25,465
at the age of 24.
By 1939, Stevens was

684
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:30,571
a rising star
in the industrial design world.

685
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:33,574
And he wanted a new home
that would express his

686
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,010
visionary take on the future.
>> Here's a designer, that

687
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:40,013
in his everyday role for us,
he's deciding,

688
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,883
what should an iron be?
What should the inside

689
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,352
of a train car be?
How does that give us a sense of

690
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:48,088
where we're going
as a progressive nation?

691
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,591
What's the future look like?
He has a chance to do that

692
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:54,428
in his own home.
>> The home that Brooks Stevens

693
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:57,264
designed for himself
and his family

694
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:59,967
is not like its neighbors,
traditional houses that look

695
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:03,470
to the past for inspiration.
The Stevens house is a bold

696
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:06,340
statement about the future.
?

697
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,381
Stevens built his house
in the village of Fox Point,

698
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:17,885
a fashionable Milwaukee suburb.
He collaborated with

699
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:21,555
architect, Fitzhugh Scott.
The house they devised

700
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:24,658
was very modern.
Historians have since dubbed

701
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:28,795
the style, Streamline Moderne.
And when it was built,

702
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:31,832
some neighbors derisively
called Stevens' new home

703
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:35,769
the only Greyhound bus station
in Fox Point.

704
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:39,273
>> Streamline Moderne
was adopted for train stations,

705
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:41,775
bus stations,
and it's because it came from

706
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:44,411
trains and buses
that were being designed.

707
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,613
So they were looking for
continuity, a look about

708
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,951
the future, and movement,
speed, travel.

709
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:54,288
So when you apply that to
a house, it's almost contrary

710
00:40:54,354 --> 00:40:57,191
to the values of a typical house
as we think of it.

711
00:40:57,257 --> 00:41:00,561
We want it to be rooted.
>> The house comes out of

712
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:03,630
the way that Brooks Stevens
sees the goods

713
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:07,601
that he's designing.
Brooks Stevens took his house

714
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:12,172
and then wrapped it in a shroud
to make it slick and clean

715
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,910
and simple and modern-looking.
>> Brooks Stevens

716
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:21,448
and his wife Alice
were still newlyweds

717
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:24,351
when they built their home.
Its exterior expressed

718
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:28,055
his career and ambitions.
But the interior

719
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,357
was a different story.
?

720
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,729
>> Brooks Stevens was someone
who made his career in

721
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,098
embracing the future.
That doesn't mean his wife

722
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:41,101
necessarily played
from that playbook.

723
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,804
>> Alice didn't exactly
buy into her husband's

724
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:47,207
design sensibility.
>> She felt that she wanted

725
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:49,710
something more traditional.
So she got her traditional

726
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:52,913
interior, and he got his
modern exterior.

727
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,148
>> They must have been
at loggerheads.

728
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:57,351
I mean, I would love to have
been a fly on the wall

729
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:01,989
and hear those conversations.
>> The interior of

730
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:08,495
Brooks Stevens' home
wasn't entirely unrelated

731
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:11,899
to its modernist wrapping.
For example,

732
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,402
throughout the home,
Stevens used aluminum.

733
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:18,272
>> In the '30s,
it's the new material.

734
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:21,008
It's finally come down in price.
So they're starting to use it

735
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:24,011
for architectural details.
Brooks Stevens is all over it.

736
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:27,648
So from the entry door to
the balustrade of the staircase,

737
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:30,751
those details in the house
reinforce the idea

738
00:42:30,817 --> 00:42:35,489
of something that's modern.
>> And the only window

739
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:40,060
with a view of the neighbors
took its cue

740
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:42,863
from streamlined ships.
>> That one window

741
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,299
that you look back
toward the neighbors

742
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:47,634
is a porthole window.
And it's almost like a lens.

743
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,738
You're seeing back in time
to history and how old

744
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:56,043
those houses look.
>> Brooks Stevens has been

745
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:00,380
described as a showman.
His house, the home for his

746
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:04,284
growing family, was also
a kind of stage set

747
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:07,154
for a modern man of business.
?

748
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:14,228
When hosting clients,
Stevens saw his home as

749
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:18,932
the perfect backdrop to sell
his vision of the future.

750
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:21,268
>> Well, he's selling
his personality,

751
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:23,937
he's selling his business,
his design acumen.

752
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:27,140
But he's also selling
a lifestyle.

753
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,610
Brooks Stevens was designing
modernity in the context

754
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:33,347
of an English country house.
It is all of

755
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:37,751
the beauty of the garden
and the house on the hill,

756
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:41,221
but it's modern.
You don't have to reject society

757
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,790
to be modern.
That progressive thinking and

758
00:43:43,857 --> 00:43:47,094
innovative thinking can exist
within a corporate context.

759
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,498
And that's the sales pitch.
>> Stevens became a nationally

760
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:55,169
prominent industrial designer.
Some of his best-known work

761
00:43:55,235 --> 00:43:59,773
included the Miller Beer logo,
the Jeep Wagoneer and

762
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,144
the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
When Stevens was asked

763
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:06,847
to identify a favorite
among his thousands of designs,

764
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:10,584
he replied, "None.
Because every one

765
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:13,887
would have to be restudied
for the tastes of tomorrow."

766
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:17,758
He was always thinking
about the future.

767
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,430
Brooks and Alice Stevens
lived in their home

768
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:26,700
for more than 40 years,
raising their four children.

769
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:30,103
Brooks Stevens died
at the age of 83.

770
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:34,041
?
The current owners of the home

771
00:44:36,577 --> 00:44:40,480
bought it from
the Stevens family in 1985.

772
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:44,985
They have renovated the house
to suit family living today.

773
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:50,424
And yet it remains a wonderful
landmark of the 1930s.

774
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,093
>> The house is probably better
than it's ever been,

775
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,829
because the new owners really
understand both the time period

776
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:59,166
as well as what Brooks Stevens
was trying to achieve

777
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:02,135
in t 1930s.
So there's no longer

778
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:07,541
any conflict between
the interiors wanting to be

779
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:10,077
French Provincial
and designer with

780
00:45:10,143 --> 00:45:13,614
Streamline Moderne
on the exterior.

781
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:18,118
Now the building envelope,
the spaces of the rooms,

782
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:20,954
the furniture within the rooms,
and the objects on those

783
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,323
pieces of furniture
are all within the context

784
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,727
of the 1930s,
and it's spectacular.

785
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:30,430
>> The Brooks Stevens house
reminds us of an America

786
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:33,433
positive about its future,
and a designer who brought

787
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,502
that future to life.
?

788
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,680
This home,
nestled in the prairies

789
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:49,082
of southeast Wisconsin,
was one of Frank Lloyd Wright's

790
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:51,919
favorites.
He designed it for

791
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:56,156
Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr.,
who was known as "Hib."

792
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:59,059
>> Hib Johnson would enjoy
saying that when they started

793
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:02,095
the project he was in charge,
and when they ended the project

794
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:05,032
Frank Lloyd Wright
was in charge.

795
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,101
And that relationship, I think,
is very indicative of how

796
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:12,639
this project was designed.
>> It was a collaboration

797
00:46:12,706 --> 00:46:16,410
of two iconic Wisconsin men.
One, a daring

798
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:19,313
captain of industry
with a great love for flight.

799
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:21,949
The other,
a 69-year-old architect

800
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:24,484
embarking on
a phase of his career

801
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:27,120
that would secure his status
as a legend.

802
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,523
The result,
Wingspread.

803
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:37,598
In the 1920s and early 30s,
Frank Lloyd Wright's

804
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:40,767
commissions were sparse.
His distinguished architectural

805
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,837
career had stalled.
Yet his most

806
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:47,975
heralded design work
still lay ahead.

807
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,911
>> Frank Lloyd Wright viewed
the 1930s as

808
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:53,714
a set of opportunities,
where the crash of

809
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,916
the stock market
was a kind of a wake-up call

810
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:58,352
to America.
That we needed to think about

811
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:00,787
our culture differently,
we needed to think about

812
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:04,324
architecture differently.
>> In 1936 Wright was contacted

813
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:09,363
by Hib Johnson, president
of the Johnson Wax Company.

814
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:12,032
Johnson expanded the company
through the Depression years

815
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:15,402
with bold decisions
and clever marketing.

816
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:18,438
He often flew his own airplane
to create publicity sensations

817
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:22,376
around the country.
Hib Johnson commissioned

818
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:25,145
Frank Lloyd Wright
to design a new headquarters

819
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:28,282
for his company.
The outcome was the Johnson Wax

820
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:32,419
Administration Building.
It helped shine the spotlight

821
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:36,456
on Wright once again,
and it delighted his patron.

822
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:39,560
>> Johnson told Wright
that if he could only sleep

823
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:42,362
at that administrative building,
he would be quite happy.

824
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,665
And Wright said,
"Well, how about we design

825
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:46,867
a house for you?"
And Wingspread was the result

826
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:50,737
of that conversation,
as the story goes.

827
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:55,576
>> Wingspread was completed
in 1939 in Wind Point,

828
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:59,513
just north of Racine.
The house was named

829
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,449
for its four wings,
as would be seen by Hib Johnson

830
00:48:02,516 --> 00:48:05,519
when he flew home
from business trips.

831
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:09,022
The 14,000 square foot home
was the largest residential

832
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:12,559
project of Wright's career.
And it would

833
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:17,531
exemplify his philosophy
of organic architecture.

834
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:21,034
Wingspread is not
an imposing mansion.

835
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,338
It sits low and horizontal
on the landscape.

836
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:28,308
Even entering the home
feels inviting and cozy.

837
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,744
>> You come in
through a very low entrance.

838
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:33,714
There's almost nothing
grand about it until

839
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,783
you come into this main space,
which almost shocks you.

840
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,852
?
>> This central core

841
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:56,703
encompasses several rooms
in one space,

842
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,174
an idea Wright refined
throughout his career.

843
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,709
The Johnson family could use
the different areas

844
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:05,679
as they needed.
>> What Wright does is create

845
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:09,883
an enormous space,
but he very carefully segregates

846
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:14,121
that space into places that can
be enjoyed, a small sitting area

847
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:17,391
for example.
That central space, by being

848
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:20,894
divided into a number
of different subsectors,

849
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,363
provides that sense of intimacy
that you would otherwise

850
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,900
never have.
>> Moving to the outdoors

851
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:35,642
at Wingspread often happens
through large French doors,

852
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:40,414
under generous overhangs,
and out onto paved terraces.

853
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,917
Organic architecture includes
the notion that a home should be

854
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:50,224
in harmony with its environment.
>> The idea in the 20th century

855
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,861
was how do you incorporate
the natural world

856
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:56,330
with the design of your house?
How do you break down

857
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:59,800
that barrier between
the inside and the outside?

858
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:02,169
So you break down
that distinction by having

859
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:04,538
spaces that are kind of
transitional spaces between

860
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:08,175
the inside and outside.
You have a patio that opens out

861
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:13,380
into the natural space.
And you situate your house

862
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:17,251
in a way that makes it part of
the natural environment.

863
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:19,119
?
>> Hib Johnson and

864
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:29,396
Frank Lloyd Wright would become
friends through the project.

865
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:32,332
But Johnson's role was perhaps
larger than the famously

866
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:35,636
autocratic architect
was used to.

867
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:40,407
The genesis of Wingspread was
unusual for a Wright project.

868
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:44,111
It was the client, Hib Johnson,
who came to Wright with a sketch

869
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:47,814
of a house with four wings,
a zoned plan that Wright

870
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:51,785
expanded and refined.
As Wright later wrote,

871
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:54,721
"I respect hunches of others,
that is, should they correspond

872
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:56,456
with mine."
?

873
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:05,032
One thing Wright and Johnson
shared was ambition.

874
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:07,601
They believed in
the American dream

875
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:11,605
and that it could be achieved.
Wright built this idea

876
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:16,176
into the heart of Wingspread.
>> The fireplace core represents

877
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:19,680
this aspirational quality
of the house.

878
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:22,683
The fireplace is the thrust
upward to the heavens,

879
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:26,587
and what that does,
is it provides that additional

880
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,989
sense of movement.
You're not just moving around

881
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:34,027
in a circle, but you're also
imagining yourself going up.

882
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:37,231
Wright made that movement
literal in this stair

883
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:39,933
that goes all the way up
to the crow's nest,

884
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,170
from which you can see
the entire lay of the estate.

885
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:45,539
>> It has been said that
Johnson's two children

886
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:48,542
came up with the idea
of the crow's nest.

887
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:51,378
Sam and Karin could get
a bird's eye view of their dad

888
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:56,116
as he flew back home.
By 1938, building Wingspread

889
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,923
was costing more than expected
and the work was slow.

890
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:06,593
That year, Johnson's enthusiasm
in completing the home waned

891
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,330
due to a personal tragedy.
While Wingspread

892
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:12,933
was under construction,
Hib Johnson's wife died,

893
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,836
and he lost interest
in finishing the house.

894
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,405
With Wright's encouragement,
he did complete the work,

895
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:22,242
and in 1939,
moved in with his two children

896
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:25,212
and later remarried.
This was Johnson's home

897
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:26,947
for 20 years.
?

898
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,987
In 1961, the Johnson family
formally dedicated Wingspread

899
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:38,358
to The Johnson Foundation.
It is used by organizations

900
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,628
around the world to meet and
discuss solutions for

901
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:44,498
environmental and community
issues.

902
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:47,034
>> It's as if Wright
thought that was

903
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,469
going to happen one day.
And to be able to talk to other

904
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:53,207
leaders in the field
in a place like Wingspread is,

905
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:55,809
in a way, the perfect expression
of the architecture

906
00:52:55,876 --> 00:53:00,280
of this building.
>> By the time Wingspread

907
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:03,584
was completed,
Wright was in his 70's.

908
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,421
The work for Hib Johnson helped
Wright build fresh momentum.

909
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:10,257
The next two decades would be
the most productive

910
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:13,560
in Wright's long career.
>> Wright's true brilliance

911
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:17,497
as an architect
is that he was able to take

912
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:21,869
what was popular stylistically
at any point in time

913
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:26,640
and filter it through his ideas
of organic architecture,

914
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:29,877
and in the end come up with
something that is very much

915
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:32,112
about him as an architect
and the way that he saw

916
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:34,648
the world.
And I think Wingspread is one

917
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:38,218
of the remarkable buildings
that you get to see that in.

918
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,487
>> Wright felt that we could
build an American architecture

919
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,390
here in the prairies of
the Midwest.

920
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,393
And I think Wingspread
is really a poem to the land

921
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,362
that it resides in.

>> These remarkable Wisconsin

923
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:05,379
houses are not simply artifacts.
Today they are beloved

924
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:09,016
private houses,
captivating museums

925
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:13,921
and dynamic meeting places.
Each of them

926
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:18,325
is as vital as ever.
And yet, they are unique

927
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:21,361
in the way they tell us
about our past.

928
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,797
>> These buildings,
they survive in the present

929
00:54:23,864 --> 00:54:26,934
in a way that writings can't
and of course people don't.

930
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,737
So they really do give us
visible, tangible reminders

931
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:33,807
of our heritage.
>> We can't save

932
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:37,177
every building everywhere.
But I think we have to

933
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:40,714
save the best.
And these are markers.

934
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:45,652
They're historical cultural
markers of our progress

935
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:48,989
in design and taste,
but also in cultural

936
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:51,625
development.
>> We all have

937
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,729
aspirations today.
There are things that we

938
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:59,900
yearn for and that we want.
And these are the houses

939
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,202
that tell us about the dreams
of people who came before us.

940
