1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:02,769
- Angela Fitzgerald:
This river town

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:07,274
has the nickname
"City of Wonderful Water."

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,877
Now, there is a new distiller
in Stevens Point

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,448
turning that water into rum,
whiskey, gin, and vodka.

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,685
- Brian Cummins: After touring,
like, 30 craft distilleries

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,855
across the country,
I jumped in with both feet.

7
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,691
- Angela: Brian Cummins hasn't
always been a distiller,

8
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,528
but his chemistry background
sure helps.

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,663
- I was a frustrated
chemical engineer

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,298
here in the local
paper industry,

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:36,270
not really seeing another
25 years in that business.

12
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:41,308
So to measure the strength of
the alcohol, we use hydrometers.

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,043
I really believe distilling

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,046
is just chemical engineering
with good taste.

15
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,916
This is now at 46.12% alcohol.

16
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,519
- Angela: The distillery's
location

17
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,656
is just a short walk
from central downtown

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,158
for Brian and his sidekick,
Remy.

19
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:02,262
- We built our new facility on a
historic manufacturing site,

20
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,665
the former Belke Lumber
building.

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,866
- Angela: Constructing
a new building

22
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,734
is only part of the plan.

23
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,605
Building commmunity is a
key component in every bottle.

24
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,640
- A handmade craft cocktail

25
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,910
really starts
with great ingredients.

26
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,312
Oh, that's really good.

27
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,782
- Angela: Those ingredients are
harvested across Wisconsin.

28
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,417
- We source all of our
ingredients

29
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,720
from within 150 miles
of our distillery.

30
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,923
It's important to me
to celebrate local growers

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,193
because they're my neighbors,
they're my friends,

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,928
they support us.

33
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,097
We wanna support them.

34
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,265
Knock, knock.

35
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,534
Here to pick up the order
for Great Northern.

36
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,835
First and foremost,

37
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,705
we started with a Polish-style
potato vodka.

38
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,040
Hey, here in Stevens Point,
central Wisconsin,

39
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,276
we are right in the middle
of potato fields.

40
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,746
Our grains are coming from
up in northern Wisconsin.

41
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,981
A small hobby farm

42
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,417
growing really great corn,
wheat, and rye for us.

43
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:01,321
We make a Wisconsin brandy
that we make from wine

44
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,323
that we distill
from our neighbor,

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,193
Sunset Point Winery,
here in downtown Stevens Point.

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,562
And then we make
our ginseng whiskey

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,698
because the best ginseng in the
world is grown right here

48
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,400
in central Wisconsin.

49
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,835
- Angela: Those Wisconsin
ingredients

50
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:19,540
are crafted in small batches
in a still designed in Germany.

51
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,575
- Brian: It really is
working sculpture.

52
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,211
It is handcrafted for us.

53
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:28,515
Having something made by hand
of 100% pure copper

54
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,250
is really important
to our process.

55
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,687
We ferment very differently
than a craft brewer does.

56
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,789
Very hot and very fast.

57
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,824
After just two days
of fermentation,

58
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,796
we go to our still, where
we concentrate that alcohol.

59
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:46,633
We do have a couple of batches
that are ready to be bottled.

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,368
Good.

61
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:53,006
- Angela: The liquor is bottled,
labeled, and packaged

62
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,508
all by hand.

63
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,676
- Brian: Small batch distilling

64
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,846
is really handcrafting
those spirits.

65
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,616
That also means that each
of our bottles has a label on it

66
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,652
that labels its batch
and bottle number,

67
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,188
hand labeled, to make sure that
people know,

68
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,825
"Hey, this is batch 34
of the whiskey."

69
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:17,297
We are making roughly 20,000
bottles a year of our spirits.

70
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,168
- Angela: Enter the tasting room
and you will see

71
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,205
Brian has an eye on the past
and a vision for the future,

72
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,475
with a vintage yet modern
supper club vibe.

73
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,978
- The best part is when
you step in

74
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,846
from our
small town Stevens Point

75
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,182
and it really
is a big city feel.

76
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:39,152
We can really put a lot of our
energy and a lot of our goodwill

77
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,721
right into that glass.

78
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,256
- Bartender: All right!

79
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,024
- We do have a signature drink.

80
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,427
I'd have to say that's our
Wisconsin Old Fashioned.

81
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,062
[ice clinking]
[liquid splashing]

82
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,999
And then flame and orange peel
over the top of it

83
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,136
to make sure we get some
nice orange flavor there.

84
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,540
One of our missions is
to elevate the cocktail culture

85
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,742
in central
and northern Wisconsin.

86
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,943
- Angela: And in the process,

87
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,812
pointing patrons
to Brian's hometown.

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,714
- It really is gratifying
to know

89
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,052
that I'm helping to build the
community of Stevens Point.

90
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,121
This place is my life.

91
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,292
I have dedicated everything
to this.

92
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,228
Small business is not
for the faint of heart.

93
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:25,699
I've put in basically every
asset committed that I have

94
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,335
to make this place a success.

95
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,671
I think I am living a dream.

96
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,740
This whole thing is kind of
like breakfast.

97
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,909
The chicken's involved
with the eggs,

98
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,245
but the pig is committed.

99
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,414
I'm committed.
[laughing]

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,149
[upbeat music]
