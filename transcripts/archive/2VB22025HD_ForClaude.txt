thank you, thank you, thank you.

167
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:19,439
Thank you for joining us
in this Fifth Quarter.

168
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:23,277
A thing that's really unique
about this band.

169
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:26,446
We love doing it,
and it warms our heart

170
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:29,650
to see people enjoying it
as well.

171
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:32,319
Back in the summer,

172
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:36,123
friends in the athletic
department said,

173
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,792
"Oregon's coming to town.

174
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,961
"We're gonna do fireworks.

175
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:44,331
Will you do a show about
fireworks?”

176
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:47,000
And so, that's what we did.

177
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:49,803
You'll hear some of everything.

178
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,538
"Blow" by Kesha.

179
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,276
Hope some of you will be
in Camp Randall

180
00:37:56,343 --> 00:38:01,148
this summer to hear Coldplay's
"Sky Full of Stars."

181
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:07,354
You'll also hear AC/DC's
"Thunderstruck."

182
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:09,089
[cheers]

183
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:15,762
"Bang Bang" by Jessie J., Ariana
Grande, and Nicki Minaj.

184
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,568
Pitbull's "Fireball."

185
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:25,606
And then,
if we're gonna do a show

186
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,310
supposedly about fireworks,

187
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:34,748
then, perhaps it would be
unconscionable

188
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:37,851
not to have the last tune
in there.

189
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:41,255
Katy Perry's "Firework."
[cheers]

190
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:50,797
This one is called
"Light Up the Sky."

[cheers and applause]

203
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,256
One of the things
that we enjoy most,

204
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,025
or I should say,

205
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:21,328
the thing that we do enjoy
the most,

206
00:49:22,362 --> 00:49:25,933
and why these students put
so much time

207
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,869
in what they do every day

208
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:34,174
is because of the response
from the audience

209
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:38,278
like yourselves and people
that are enjoying

210
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:39,613
what they are doing,

211
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,151
and it is not something that
we take for granted.

212
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,119
So thank you.

213
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:49,122
Thank you so much for being
with us again.

214
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:51,325
[cheers and applause]

215
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:56,363
So the first concert
was in 1976, March 21,

216
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:01,435
actually ‘75, 1975,

217
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:07,074
in Mills Concert Hall
at the School of Music.

218
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,311
And I'd like to give a shout-out
to Dan Evans,

219
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:15,916
who's been researching the band
and compiling photos.

220
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:18,652
If you look up at that screen,

221
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:24,358
you'll see some photos
from those early concerts.

222
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:31,565
The first concert had 450 people
in attendance,

223
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:35,369
and it's just grown
over the years.

224
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:39,640
You will also notice that
Mike Leckrone

225
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,042
had a nice fashion sense.

226
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,613
Very, very, very early on
in the concerts.

227
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,385
And we're so grateful

228
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:55,856
to be able to have this event
every year.

229
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:59,159
And we're grateful
that the person

230
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:03,830
that created this event
is in the house today,

231
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:07,434
along with his wonderful family.

232
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:11,505
So just wish to thank Mike
for all he's done.

233
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,543
Thank you, Mike!

234
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,417
[cheers and applause]

235
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:38,265
On the stage are some
fine young people

236
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,236
that are wearing roses.

237
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:48,976
Those are the members
of our senior class for whom

238
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:54,314
this is their last Varsity Band
concert.

239
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:59,853
And I can't begin
to impress upon you

240
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:05,359
just how remarkable
these individuals are

241
00:52:07,027 --> 00:52:11,265
and how much they do
to keep the program going.

242
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:17,971
I'm going to miss them dearly.

243
00:52:18,038 --> 00:52:20,574
My colleagues on this stage,

244
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:24,178
the other students are going
to miss them dearly,

245
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,247
and we hope they come back
often.

246
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:31,818
Please stand,
members of the senior class.

We love you.

251
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,980
We appreciate you very,
very much.

252
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,784
We'll close today's program

253
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:07,521
with our signature
Badger Band Finale.

254
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:12,159
Please help us celebrate the
University of Wisconsin

255
00:53:12,226 --> 00:53:16,230
and this great band.
