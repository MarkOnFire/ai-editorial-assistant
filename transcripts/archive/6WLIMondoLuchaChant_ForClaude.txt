This past Friday, PBS Wisconsin
was filming at a local pro

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,772
wrestling event called Mondo
Lucha

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,641
for an upcoming story we're
producing.

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,042
In the middle of the show

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,746
the host let the crowd know PBS
Wisconsin was in the house.

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,616
And just like that,
hundreds of fans started

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,950
clapping and chanting.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,919
“PBS, PBS, PBS, PBS”

9
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,562
Proof that public broadcasting
and pro wrestling

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,098
are the ultimate tag team.
