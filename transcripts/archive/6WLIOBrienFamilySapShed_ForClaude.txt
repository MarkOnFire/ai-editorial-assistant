1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:01,535
We thank you

2
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:04,004
for the beauty of this
surrounding

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,940
the forethought of our ancestors

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,476
that came to this country

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,604
Saint Patty's weekend

6
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,742
is really about coming home
and it's all family.

7
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,043
You know, everybody.

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,379
Even if there's 100 people,
you still know everybody.

9
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,415
I'm sure that's why our family
has remained as close as we

10
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,150
have been.
