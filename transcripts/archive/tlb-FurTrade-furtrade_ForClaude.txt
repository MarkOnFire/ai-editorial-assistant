00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:03,294
- The North American fur trade
refers to the exchange of goods,

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,797
including animal furs,
between Europeans

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,132
and Indigenous peoples.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,676
Native peoples had been
using and trading furs

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,138
amongst themselves for thousands
of years in North America.

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,973
In the area that
became Wisconsin,

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,225
this included the
Menominee, the Ho-Chunk,

8
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,395
Ojibwe, Potawatomi,
and Dakota, among others.

9
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,147
With the arrival of Europeans,

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,816
the trade became
a global exchange.

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,777
The French, Dutch, British,
and others were keen

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,321
to trade with Native partners
across the Atlantic.

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,991
Exchanging goods for furs
and animal skins

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,452
may seem like a
simple transaction,

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,829
but this was a big deal
for the development

16
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,998
of how Native peoples
in the Americas

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,958
interacted with Europeans.

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,461
Eventually, the trading
of furs would be connected

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,463
not just to clothing
and fashion,

20
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,673
but to global
and local politics,

21
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,467
cultural
and social interactions,

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,387
labor, religion, and
unfortunately, colonialism.
