00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,572
[bright classical guitar music]

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,675
- Angela Fitzgerald: Kevin Loh
is a guitar prodigy

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:13,747
from Singapore who plays
with purpose and precision.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,187
- Kevin Loh: I try to provide
a sort of refreshing take

5
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,589
on classical guitar repertoire

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:27,661
that really pushes classical
music to the next level.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,004
- Angela: Kevin is pursuing a
master's in guitar performance

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,240
at the University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

9
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:44,278
On the classical guitar,
he is a virtuoso.

10
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,152
- René Izquierdo: I knew that
minute I heard him play

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,921
the very first time

12
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,757
that he was gonna be one
of the great guitarists

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,492
of our time.

14
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,529
- Angela: That's saying a lot,
coming from René Izquierdo,

15
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:07,968
a maestro on classical guitar
and Kevin's music professor.

16
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,204
- René: He's a quick learner,
very quick.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,640
And maybe with the right side
of the nail to get,

18
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,808
there you go.

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,211
- I first met René in 2014.

20
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:22,149
It was at a guitar festival
in Iserlohn, Germany.

21
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,884
[René singing]

22
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,886
I was just mesmerized right away

23
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:30,424
as to the level of teaching
that René was giving.

24
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,560
And for me,
it was a matter of when,

25
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,597
not if, as to when I'd arrive
in Milwaukee

26
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,000
to pursue further studies
with him.

27
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,169
There's a difference
between [note playing]

28
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,670
and [note playing].

29
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:47,841
One of the biggest lessons that
I had already heard of,

30
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,043
but it was really
reinforced with René,

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,013
was that talent alone
is not enough.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,049
[bright classical guitar music]

33
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,087
- René: When you find
that talent

34
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,390
meets desire and sacrifice,

35
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,359
that's where you have all
those elements

36
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,761
to make a great musician.

37
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,833
- Angela: Before René,

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,405
another man started Kevin on a
path from Singapore to success.

39
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,408
[gentle classical guitar music]

40
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,680
- Kevin: My father and I were
simply just playing the guitar

41
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,081
in our living room,

42
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,385
and my mother would be
behind the camera, filming us.

43
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,421
[bright classical guitar music]

44
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,090
- Angela: Within a few years,

45
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,294
these home videos had been
viewed worldwide

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,497
on the family's YouTube channel.

47
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,169
[gentle classical guitar music]

48
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,572
- Kevin: So, it was around 9
or 10 years of age

49
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,575
when people were saying, "Okay,
there's something here.

50
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,510
We can push this further
a little bit."

51
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:00,247
That was when the bigger
performances started to come in,

52
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,684
giving me my debut at the
Esplanade Concert Hall,

53
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,786
which is, like, one of the
two big concert halls

54
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,287
in Singapore.

55
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,290
At that point, my father and I
were like, "Wow, okay."

56
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,360
You know, all these
opportunities came along

57
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,430
because of this added exposure.

58
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,367
I performed in the
Berlin Konzerthaus.

59
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,136
I've played in the
London Wigmore Hall.

60
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:28,308
I've also played in places like
the Suntory Hall in Tokyo.

61
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,279
All of these places are real
prestigious sort of venues.

62
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,616
[bright classical guitar music]

63
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,118
- René: Everyone on the
world stage knows him.

64
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,154
People can tell every time
they hear him playing,

65
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,490
even the simplest pieces,

66
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,493
that this is just beyond
playing guitar well.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,396
This is just guitar at its best.

68
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,668
- Angela: Kevin has won the
highest national

69
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:59,072
and international awards
for classical guitar,

70
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,910
and he could also win a medal
for modesty.

71
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,412
- Kevin: It's not so much about
the results

72
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,214
or the glamour necessarily.

73
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,449
It really is
appreciating the craft

74
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,320
and understanding that
it's the journey.

75
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,522
- René: This is one of the
best in the world

76
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,126
because right now, he has
nothing else left to prove.

77
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,929
- It feels really weird because
normally, he will make sure

78
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,498
to avoid saying anything
of the sort.

79
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,134
- That's true.
[both laugh]

80
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,904
- Angela: The accolades
are welcome,

81
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,006
but what Kevin still cherishes

82
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,310
is the musical advice
from his dad.

83
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,346
- Kevin: He was the one who
brought the guitar idea

84
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,149
to the table to begin with.
[laughs]

85
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,885
He's taught me a lot
of life lessons.

86
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,287
He often brought those lessons

87
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,624
through the guitar sessions
that we had.

88
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,527
I'm very grateful for that
because I feel

89
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:59,066
that contributed to the passion
of music making very much.

90
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,538
Very good.

91
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,507
- Angela: Today, Kevin is
sharing that passion

92
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,810
with UWM students
he helps mentor.

93
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,347
[note playing]
- Kevin: Yeah.

94
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:19,686
I find myself saying the exact
same things that he's taught me.

95
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,055
If you're taking a breath
physically,

96
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,891
take a breath musically.

97
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,792
And I have that
out-of-body experience

98
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,960
where it's like, "Damn,

99
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:31,131
I'm really turning
into my father." [laughs]

100
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,333
[gentle guitar notes]

101
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,337
- Angela: Classical guitar is
the instrument that taught Kevin

102
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:41,375
your passion can become
your profession.

103
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,846
[gentle classical guitar music]

104
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,814
- René: No doubt he's gonna be
concertizing,

105
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,918
performing, teaching
at the highest level

106
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,986
anywhere he would be.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,888
- You're forging your own path.

108
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,723
You create your own story.

109
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,593
And you only live once, right?

110
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,830
I am just really fortunate
to be here. [laughs]

111
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,867
[gentle classical guitar music]

112
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,840
