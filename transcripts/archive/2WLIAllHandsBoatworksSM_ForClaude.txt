- Bill Nimke: The Greek
philosopher Anaxagoras said,

00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,450
"Man is the wisest of animals
because he has hands."

[music]

00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:23,056
The use of our hands
stimulates, I believe,

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,992
awakens a portion
of our brain

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,794
that we sometimes
are not tapping into.

All Hands Boatworks

11
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:36,103
is truly a grassroots
community organization

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,973
that has grown literally
out of the trunk of my car.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,842
[rock music drumbeat]

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,779
We started by loading up
tools and lumber and supplies

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:51,518
and bringing the projects to
a school or youth organization,

16
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,322
and building these simple
12-foot rowing boats

17
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,024
there on site.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,093
And a lot has happened,
you know, since 10 years ago.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,828
[friction]

20
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,098
Often, kids simply--

21
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,234
They don't know
what they're getting into.

22
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,338
And I love the challenge
that's presented to 'em.

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,909
One of the many gratifying,
rewarding elements of what we do

24
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,847
is to see some of the impact
that takes place,

25
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,217
often just over the course
of a single project.

26
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,685
And for
a lot of kids,

27
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,189
that first boat-building project
takes about 30, 35 hours.

28
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,258
- Instructor: And I'll
work with you on that.

29
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,759
I can show you
how to mask.

30
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,828
- Bill: Many times,
when they start,

31
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,931
the kids have
some apprehensions, rightly so,

32
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,666
about using
some of the hand tools.

33
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,168
And, of course,
we show them

34
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,470
how to use them
properly and safely.

35
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,106
We observe
many, many times

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,609
how you can see
a certain growth

37
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,311
in their own confidence
in using those tools.

38
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,948
And there is a significant
pride of accomplishment

39
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,683
that we see
in them

40
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,019
and that the kids
talk about

41
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,487
once the project
is finished

42
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,123
and the boats
are launched.

43
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,127
Our volunteers
are certainly

44
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,530
the lifeblood
of the organization.

45
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,231
We have
a current active core

46
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,502
of anywhere from a dozen
to fifteen or so volunteers.

47
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,506
We always welcome folks
to come in and offer to help.

48
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,608
- Instructor: And that
helps him a ton

49
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,278
to keep it
so they get a square cut.

50
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,846
- Frank: Some help
in the shop

51
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,716
with fabrication of parts
and work on the machines

52
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,552
and repair of equipment.

53
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,721
Others are right there
rubbing elbows, so to speak,

54
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,123
with the kids.

55
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,861
They're teaching and instructing
and mentoring.

56
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,565
We work with
hundreds of kids each year

57
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,301
from the greater metro area.

58
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,270
And it's
a bit surprising,

59
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,739
and yet
a reality, that

60
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:57,110
a number of kids haven't
even been to the lakefront.

61
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,280
They don't even know
very much about Lake Michigan

62
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,216
or our Great Lakes.

63
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,285
At the same time, they may
live in a neighborhood

64
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,056
that's just several blocks away
from one of our major rivers.

65
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,959
And so, you know,
through the boat building,

66
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,828
again, it's important
that we take these craft,

67
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,964
these small craft,
and get out on the water,

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,367
and get involved
with our waterways.

69
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,803
And it becomes
a stimulus

70
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,439
for thinking about the water
and the quality of the water.

71
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,741
[sander whirrs loudly]

72
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:33,413
Wooden boats have been
built by human beings

73
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:38,585
for probably as long
as human beings have existed

74
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,855
or, you know, needing
of some form of a transportation

75
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:46,927
or to get from one bank of
the river across to the other.

76
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,564
There's a beauty
and an elegance

77
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,901
in the form
of a wooden boat itself

78
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,205
that's captivating
and that we appreciate.

79

[mesmerizing piano sequence]

80
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:09,249
We want to make sure that we
are a sustainable organization.

81
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,186
And that means not only
continuing to attract

82
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,820
the resources we need

83
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:17,691
to deliver the programming
that we have

84
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,727
but also
building our capacities

85
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,263
to work with
even more young people,

86
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,998
in our area.
