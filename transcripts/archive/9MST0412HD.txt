00:00:00:00 - 00:00:11:10
Speaker 1
I am in Michigan, on the eastern shores of Lake Michigan, in a former lumber town that is now home to a very big ship.

00:00:11:12 - 00:00:17:16
Speaker 2
We thank the underwriters of down Midland's main streets because without them, we couldn't make this show.

00:00:17:18 - 00:00:33:10
Speaker 3
Your community's best selfie spot is your type from the Green Circle Trail to Point Brewery. You'll find more fun in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Visit Oconomowoc Lakes festivals, shopping, dining in the heart of Lake Country.

00:00:33:12 - 00:00:43:09
Speaker 4
My father taught me that to make great bakery, you have to do it the right way. Oh, and a Danish bakery where criminal traditions begin.

00:00:43:11 - 00:01:22:28
Speaker 2
Yes, Greendale is beautiful on the outside, but it's what's inside that counts. Who doesn't love opening a door to their happy place? Whether it's indulging your sweet tooth. Winding down. Or exploring your creative side. Come on in. You just got to see Greendale. There's always something shining bright in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Heizer automotive is honored to help John McGivern and his team arrive safely to many main streets.

00:01:23:00 - 00:01:41:04
Speaker 2
We are committed to remaining true to the highway. Do what's right for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve. We are happy to help Horicon Bank, West Bend Insurance Company, the Friends of Main Street, and the friends of PBS Wisconsin.

00:01:41:07 - 00:01:59:24
Unknown
Because these are our main streets. Something about a hometown speaks to me. There's no one else I'd rather be. The heart and soul of communities right here on these main streets.

00:01:59:26 - 00:02:30:08
Speaker 1
I am in Waterfront Park in Ludington, Michigan. In the 1850s, settlers came to start lumber mills and the interesting thing, once the lumber was all gone, the lumber barons stuck around. Ludington has a population of 7700 people. It's 3.6miÂ², and it's in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. It is right on the lake, right in the middle of the coast, and it's about 100 miles north west of Grand Rapids.

00:02:30:13 - 00:02:39:06
Speaker 1
This is Ludington, Michigan. I mean, why did the lumber barons stick around after all of the forests were gone?

00:02:39:08 - 00:02:58:09
Speaker 3
You know that feeling we get after we've been to a community filming where we fall in love with the people we fall in love with the area. That's exactly the feeling the lumber barons had. So they decided, let's bring in some electricity and some telephones and some transit and make a go of this. And no one did more for this community than James Ludington and his story.

00:02:58:10 - 00:03:15:12
Speaker 3
He came to this area because he was going to run a mill that he had acquired through a defaulted loan, and he just kept adding more bridges, more roads. He just did so much for this community that they renamed it after him. He built this city not on rock and roll and woods and water.

00:03:15:19 - 00:03:22:01
Speaker 1
And woods and water. So I get the woods because they were lumber barons. But where does the water fit in?

00:03:22:02 - 00:03:26:28
Speaker 3
By 1950, this was the busiest car ferry port in the entire world.

00:03:27:00 - 00:03:29:28
Speaker 1
And when you say car fair, you're talking about.

00:03:30:00 - 00:03:31:17
Speaker 6
That bigger operation. Oh, yeah.

00:03:31:23 - 00:03:45:17
Speaker 3
The SS Badger, one of only two Lake Michigan car ferries still in operation today. 600 people can go on her 180 vehicles. And it's how we got over here.

00:03:45:20 - 00:03:52:18
Speaker 1
We could either do this, or we could drive from Milwaukee, around Chicago, and then up to Ludington. Boat.

00:03:52:20 - 00:03:55:01
Speaker 3
Come on. And beautiful day for sailing.

00:03:55:02 - 00:03:55:16
Speaker 2
You can.

00:03:55:16 - 00:03:57:12
Speaker 3
Sunbathe. Look at these. We got cheese.

00:03:57:12 - 00:04:00:17
Speaker 1
Lounges. I got to go because I'm calling bingo in a minute.

00:04:00:25 - 00:04:15:13
Speaker 6
My name is Michael. I'll be calling bingo today. Also today we have John McGovern's main Street. You guys know? Yeah, yeah. And there's. And is still came. Okay. You ready?

00:04:15:15 - 00:04:16:01
Speaker 1
Let's go.

00:04:16:05 - 00:04:17:16
Speaker 6
Here we go.

00:04:17:18 - 00:04:26:29
Speaker 1
I 21. No, ma'am. You don't have bingo. What? I 22 I almost said 122.

00:04:27:04 - 00:04:28:15
Speaker 6
I told you earlier, this is hard.

00:04:28:15 - 00:04:33:20
Speaker 1
G 54.

00:04:33:23 - 00:04:49:00
Speaker 3
You know, John's always going to special places. He's not the only one today. This room right here is the most important room on the ship. Thank you so much for letting us up here. What do you love most about this job? The view.

00:04:49:01 - 00:05:00:12
Speaker 6
The view out of my office is absolutely spectacular. As you see. I love interacting with our passengers, with the people. Everybody's having a good time, and it's just a great experience to walk around and talk to people and see where they're from and what they're good.

00:05:00:16 - 00:05:04:22
Speaker 1
Are there any more of these in the Great Lakes? Are there any more of these anywhere?

00:05:04:28 - 00:05:11:29
Speaker 6
Oh, this is the only one. This is the only one that goes across the lake and that's steam powered. And it's 71 years old.

00:05:12:01 - 00:05:12:25
Speaker 1
It's really cool.

00:05:12:29 - 00:05:13:24
Speaker 6
It's really cool.

00:05:13:24 - 00:05:17:14
Speaker 1
And I bet you have guests from all over the world who want to experience this with you.

00:05:17:18 - 00:05:41:13
Speaker 6
It's been millions of people. Yeah. And a lot of the people remember our communities. Manitowoc and Ludington, by the experience they had aboard the Badger. And, it's just such a a big component of the lifestyle of the two kind of small communities. I don't think you can overstate that. We think we have a really unique vessel here, and we love to share it with others.

00:05:41:16 - 00:05:45:11
Speaker 6
That's how we welcome everybody to Ludington with our lighthouse.

00:05:45:13 - 00:05:53:09
Speaker 1
So, I mean, if I ever retire, guess what? I'm going to do what I call a bingo in the Badger for the rest of my life.

00:05:53:12 - 00:06:07:11
Speaker 1
Did you know that the S.S. Badger has a sister ship, the SS Spartan? The Spartan was decommissioned in 1979, and now it's used mostly for parts for the S.S. Badger. I have a question. How did the Badger and Spartan get their name?

00:06:07:16 - 00:06:08:29
Speaker 3
Hey, I have the answer.

00:06:09:00 - 00:06:09:14
Speaker 1
I knew you.

00:06:09:14 - 00:06:10:07
Speaker 3
Would be right here.

00:06:10:08 - 00:06:10:28
Speaker 1
Here she is.

00:06:11:00 - 00:06:32:11
Speaker 3
It might be the easiest trivia question we've asked you all season, but the ships got their name because they are two of the mascots from the state's, you know, Michigan State Spartans and the Wisconsin Badgers. But I'd just like to point out that it's the Badger that is still running. Go, Wisconsin!

00:06:32:13 - 00:06:37:16
Speaker 1
It's always fun to come to a place that has a status of being iconic. How did this all happened?

00:06:37:19 - 00:06:52:25
Speaker 7
In 1948, my grandfather ran, you know, the small ice cream parlor then that had a jukebox in the corner. And yeah, that was a really good, good life. And then I came around in 1960, and at that point, my dad and my grandfather had gone to exclusively producing ice cream.

00:06:52:27 - 00:06:54:16
Speaker 1
But now it's full service every day.

00:06:54:18 - 00:06:56:04
Speaker 7
Yeah, we do breakfast, lunch and dinner.

00:06:56:04 - 00:06:57:09
Speaker 1
Is ice cream still made?

00:06:57:09 - 00:07:18:17
Speaker 7
Here it is. Yeah. My dad used to say that my grandpa made 100,000 gallons of ice cream in a year, and my dad said I made 100,000 gallons of ice cream in a day. We make somewhere between about 28,000,030 million gallons a year. But the fourth generation is here. My son in law is our GM. My grandson, Everett, loves to work with me so.

00:07:18:17 - 00:07:20:29
Speaker 1
And a really popular place in town there.

00:07:20:29 - 00:07:23:11
Speaker 7
You know, there's line. So I guess that means that we're popular.

00:07:23:13 - 00:07:25:23
Speaker 1
And your water we got. What are you going with first?

00:07:25:26 - 00:07:29:01
Speaker 6
Right now I'm just making one of our Super Picks dinners.

00:07:29:08 - 00:07:30:05
Speaker 1
Super pinks.

00:07:30:09 - 00:07:33:00
Speaker 6
Yeah. What's that? That is our our morrow tree.

00:07:33:00 - 00:07:34:25
Speaker 1
Moose trimmings. Oh, that looks good.

00:07:34:25 - 00:07:42:11
Speaker 6
Coconut joy special here. It's a Michigan powerful beyond chocolate super mix.

00:07:42:14 - 00:07:47:19
Speaker 1
There was a lemon. Something as well with lemon cheesecake. We're good. Right?

00:07:47:22 - 00:07:50:23
Speaker 7
Oh it is. Yeah. Blue moon is a midwestern United States flavor.

00:07:50:24 - 00:07:52:12
Speaker 1
And flavor wise, what is it?

00:07:52:15 - 00:07:53:29
Speaker 7
It's. Nobody knows. Whip it.

00:07:53:29 - 00:07:59:08
Speaker 1
Andrew. Flavor wise. Yeah. It's different every season.

00:07:59:13 - 00:08:16:21
Speaker 7
So we run typically 42 flavors of ice cream in a summer season. You know, in the winter we have about 36 flavors. We change it up, which is a big deal to people for the most part. I want to have them find what they're looking for. Yeah. If I take a flavor off, they're mad. Don't be crabby. You'll have to leave.

00:08:16:25 - 00:08:18:09
Speaker 7
Right.

00:08:18:11 - 00:08:43:06
Speaker 3
And here's my Ludington, Tim James Port Brewing Company. Back in the late 1800s, this building housed Johnson Brothers Saloon. And for the next 100 years, plus, it was a variety of different businesses. But it's back to its beer roots 110 years later. This is their flagship beer. It's the blueberry wheat. Okay, I'll drink it.

00:08:43:09 - 00:08:46:09
Speaker 1
Fantastic.

00:08:46:11 - 00:09:04:23
Speaker 1
If you're looking for a souvenir from Ludington, that's not a keychain or a shot glass. You really should consider a beautiful piece of art that you can hang on the wall. Come on. Here. Todd and Brad Reed and Rachel Gaudet are a family of photographers who tell Michigan's stories through photos and text.

00:09:04:25 - 00:09:18:00
Speaker 8
When I first saw her, kind of took my breath away. She was over here. Yeah. And I saw this negative space. Waited till she got into there. Turned out to be one of the best photos they've ever taken. This is the biggest cloud you've ever seen.

00:09:18:01 - 00:09:19:04
Speaker 1
It looks mean.

00:09:19:05 - 00:09:26:13
Speaker 8
And they had choppers out of a bedroom window. And then the next morning when we downloaded it, we found this couple here.

00:09:26:13 - 00:09:28:15
Speaker 1
Oh, having an electric kiss?

00:09:28:16 - 00:09:33:13
Speaker 3
Yeah, we had no idea. Looking at the back of the camera when he brought his camera in that they were there.

00:09:33:17 - 00:09:39:25
Speaker 6
Nothing I like better than a storm. We look for magic moments during storms and when storm light comes out.

00:09:39:27 - 00:09:50:29
Speaker 3
You know, I think there are times we hope we set out to get something. But when we see the final image, especially when you can see it bigger on the computer or in print bigger, you know, it definitely feel.

00:09:50:29 - 00:10:05:25
Speaker 1
Like that was really good. Yeah, they have books and calendars and puzzles that celebrate their views. Beautiful. Spectacular. Michigan. Now that's a souvenir.

00:10:05:28 - 00:10:18:05
Speaker 1
We are outside the Cartier mansion. It's a bed and breakfast. And this is your house and your business. And you do a really good job. Detail is really what you guys are best at. Tell me the history. All right.

00:10:18:06 - 00:10:32:29
Speaker 3
Absolutely. Built in 1905 by Warren Cartier and his wife, Kate Warren was an entrepreneur, civil engineer, and wanted to come back to Ludington and make this his forever home. Built the house in 18 months. Oh, $100,000.

00:10:33:07 - 00:10:33:26
Speaker 1
100,000.

00:10:33:26 - 00:10:36:01
Speaker 3
Dollars hundred thousand. I know what you get for me, steel.

00:10:36:02 - 00:10:41:17
Speaker 1
Come on. And he built it across the street from his parents. And did he wanted to outdo his dad?

00:10:41:22 - 00:10:45:29
Speaker 3
Well, of course he had to make himself look a lot better than dad. And and he did.

00:10:45:29 - 00:10:50:14
Speaker 1
So when you bought the mansion, was the Ludington house part of that as well?

00:10:50:20 - 00:11:00:06
Speaker 3
It was actually other owners next door running the Ludington house, and they were looking to retire. So they had reached out to us one day and asked if we were interested. And we said, absolutely.

00:11:00:11 - 00:11:12:05
Speaker 6
It's a really good fit, two slightly different types of properties, one a little bit more traditional, and then of course the modern mansion and then the carriage house. So you have, you know, a little bit of a different feel and price point depending on what people are looking for.

00:11:12:08 - 00:11:15:22
Speaker 1
Here is this table. And what did a Cartier do?

00:11:15:23 - 00:11:19:24
Speaker 3
His father was the lumber baron. Warren was more of an entrepreneur.

00:11:19:25 - 00:11:32:00
Speaker 6
One of my favorite stories with with the Cartier family was they brought the bank into Ludington and, during the depression, personally stood behind the deposits so that people had the confidence to keep going.

00:11:32:00 - 00:11:34:06
Speaker 1
It's like it's a wonderful life.

00:11:34:09 - 00:11:35:18
Speaker 3
Yeah.

00:11:35:20 - 00:11:41:02
Speaker 1
We're off to the King's suite. I want to move in here. Did you do the design?

00:11:41:04 - 00:11:57:22
Speaker 3
Some of that we did. Some of it was designed this way. When we bought it, the balcony was not part of the original design initially, and as were most planning, his father strongly encouraged him to build a balcony off of his bedroom. Because his father envisioned this to be the next governor's mansion.

00:11:57:25 - 00:11:59:25
Speaker 1
Because he thought his kid was going to be the governor.

00:11:59:25 - 00:12:01:23
Speaker 3
He did. How about the pressure.

00:12:01:24 - 00:12:02:04
Speaker 1
That was.

00:12:02:04 - 00:12:02:17
Speaker 3
Lost?

00:12:02:18 - 00:12:11:29
Speaker 1
His dad? Give me a break. Now I want to go to the bathroom because there's something in there that has to be seen. First of all, of course. Original.

00:12:11:29 - 00:12:12:29
Speaker 3
Yes. Oh, yes.

00:12:13:02 - 00:12:13:19
Speaker 1
Original.

00:12:13:19 - 00:12:14:09
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:12:14:11 - 00:12:19:26
Speaker 1
This is a footbath. This is the piece that needs to be,

00:12:19:28 - 00:12:22:01
Speaker 6
Explored.

00:12:22:03 - 00:12:23:22
Speaker 3
This is a Wolfe needle shower.

00:12:23:23 - 00:12:24:19
Speaker 1
Does water come out.

00:12:24:19 - 00:12:33:19
Speaker 3
Of hundreds of holes? The top, the sides, the bread. And if you want to get, the full experience. Yes, the bidet down below.

00:12:33:20 - 00:12:34:14
Speaker 1
The bidet is right.

00:12:34:14 - 00:12:53:06
Speaker 3
There. Finish it off for you. So. And the instructions said under no circumstance was us women allowed to use it who are way too frail to handle the animal shelter. So what's the first thing I did when I bought the property? Give me that thing. Usually at breakfast felt like morning. My first question is tell me about the need a shower?

00:12:53:08 - 00:12:56:12
Speaker 3
And they have so much fun talking about their experience. So I had a question.

00:12:56:16 - 00:13:03:25
Speaker 1
Did your shower? Shower?

00:13:03:27 - 00:13:25:00
Speaker 1
There are a lot of hidden gems in Ludington in Mason County that visitors miss. So what they've done is they've organized all of those locations in what they call history trails. They celebrate the history of music and maritime and barn quilts and my favorite sculptures with an attitude like that, you're never going to make it to the majors.

00:13:25:04 - 00:13:40:18
Speaker 1
Hey, Gramps, I think that one's big enough to keep. What you need to do to get the full story is to call a number. There are many ways to commemorate the heritage of lumbering and an art form. And artist Robert Dewey.

00:13:40:20 - 00:13:41:27
Speaker 6
Welcome to Florida Craft Week.

00:13:41:28 - 00:13:44:04
Speaker 1
Thank you so much. Everybody knows this product.

00:13:44:07 - 00:13:49:02
Speaker 6
Yeah. So well for crafts. Been here for 78 years. We're celebrating our 70th anniversary.

00:13:49:08 - 00:13:50:14
Speaker 1
Happy anniversary. Thank you.

00:13:50:15 - 00:14:12:05
Speaker 6
78 years 78 years. And the company really started out as a company that collected and dried oak leaves and then sold them to local floras. And we've really evolved into a company that makes and fabricates a wide variety of forms for the floral and craft industries. Our products can be found in over 20,000 retail locations nationwide. Yeah, so you've probably seen our products before.

00:14:12:09 - 00:14:15:14
Speaker 6
All these products are either made or made and fabricated here.

00:14:15:16 - 00:14:17:05
Speaker 1
And the company started here as well.

00:14:17:05 - 00:14:32:22
Speaker 6
Yes. We have 240 people here in Lincoln that work here. Are campuses on about 16 acres. It's kind of massive. Yeah. We have 450,000ftÂ². Wow. We have a bunch of employees that have been here for 20, 30 years. It's,

00:14:32:24 - 00:14:35:16
Speaker 1
And has the process changed at all a lot.

00:14:35:19 - 00:14:44:07
Speaker 6
As technology has just gotten better, particularly with wrapping equipment, fabrication and robotics. The process is probably the one thing that improves every year for us.

00:14:44:15 - 00:14:45:27
Speaker 1
And how do you make it?

00:14:45:27 - 00:15:05:13
Speaker 6
We extrude the XPS foam, then we we fabricated, meaning we cut it down into different sizes and shapes, kind of like a sawmill, for instance. Yeah. And then we have fabrication equipment that can turn into cones and balls. Yeah. You've had kids, you've made a solar system out of, out of those balls. We have wrapping ability to be able to wrap it for retail.

00:15:05:13 - 00:15:18:01
Speaker 6
And then we have our packaging abilities. So it's using vision technology to be able to identify the location of the block. And then it creates a pattern and then that pattern gets picked up and loaded into the case.

00:15:18:03 - 00:15:19:21
Speaker 1
This used to be all done by hand.

00:15:19:22 - 00:15:37:28
Speaker 6
It's all be done by hand. Yeah. Yes. I've been here 25 years. Yeah. Started in 2000 and you know, over the course of a couple decades have really grown to love this company. Yeah. We always say that we're part of people's lives and their most important moments. So yeah, you'll find our products at at weddings. You'll find about birthday parties who find them at funerals.

00:15:37:29 - 00:15:41:15
Speaker 6
So all of the important moments in life, they'll usually find one of our pieces.

00:15:41:15 - 00:16:17:18
Speaker 1
You're part of it or part of it. If you're from the Midwest, I'm sure you are aware of a town or a river or a park named after the French Jesuit missionary explorer pair. Marquette Pier, by the way, means father in French. This is the area where he died in 1675 at the age of 37. He was one of the first Europeans to create a detailed map of the Mississippi River, and his further explorations of the Midwest really laid the groundwork for settlers for over 200 years.

00:16:17:21 - 00:16:40:22
Speaker 6
Mason County Historical Society started this back in 76. We've recreated a lot of the local communities. In fact, the oldest building we believe that's still standing in the in the county is our courthouse over there, built in 1849. Oh, nice. And then we brought in other buildings, many of them authentic, but very old farmhouse that was moved here at the school is authentic, moved here.

00:16:40:22 - 00:16:50:06
Speaker 6
The town hall is authentic, moved here. There's around 30 buildings. 30. That's if you count the outhouses. Yeah, yeah. Thanks for doing that.

00:16:50:08 - 00:16:53:24
Speaker 1
It was lumber that really created this part of Michigan.

00:16:53:28 - 00:17:14:19
Speaker 6
Oh, no question about it. This was all covered with white pine trees. They were like gold. There's belief that there was more income generated from white pine in Michigan. Then there was gold in California. White pine has two very distinct properties. One of them is it's a softer wood. And in those days, the, tools were all hand tools.

00:17:14:22 - 00:17:35:11
Speaker 6
Somebody had any power saws. So they like working with pine. The other thing about pine logs, even big logs, is they float. So we were able to harvest from distance. And in the spring, when the water was the highest, you'd have all these logs coming down to the ends of the rivers where the mills were. Frequently what happened is they only went so far.

00:17:35:11 - 00:17:49:12
Speaker 6
And then there was a log jam. He actually had men that would go out on there, try to find the key log to pull the log out. That would let it go. Sometimes they couldn't find that log or they couldn't remove it. So the next step was dynamite. And that's what's being used here.

00:17:49:18 - 00:17:51:15
Speaker 1
Look at these guys.

00:17:51:18 - 00:17:55:17
Speaker 6
They're like run. Well, exactly. I mean they know what's going to happen now.

00:17:55:18 - 00:17:57:10
Speaker 1
Yeah. And that's the stump puller.

00:17:57:12 - 00:17:59:12
Speaker 6
Stump poller.

00:17:59:14 - 00:18:02:17
Speaker 1
This is an original lumber camp building.

00:18:02:17 - 00:18:18:16
Speaker 6
Those two buildings were literally, we believe, the last camp that existed. And so we, number all the boards, disassemble them, bring them here, and reassemble them. And we have a lot of photos of lumber camps. And in many of them, there is one woman, and she's the cook.

00:18:18:23 - 00:18:23:10
Speaker 1
Who are they? What are they doing here? Are the kids like, can we go home?

00:18:23:13 - 00:18:26:21
Speaker 6
My assumption is that's a that's an owner and his wife.

00:18:26:28 - 00:18:37:05
Speaker 1
I think this is the cook and this is an older sister or mother, and these are the kids. And do you think that that her husband has one of the loggers?

00:18:37:05 - 00:18:39:00
Speaker 6
Do you have a better imagination tonight?

00:18:39:01 - 00:18:42:20
Speaker 1
Well, there we go.

00:18:42:23 - 00:18:57:13
Speaker 1
In Ludington you see a lot of these these multi game boards that I remember from my childhood. It turns out they were made right here in Ludington. What are these game boards called.

00:18:57:16 - 00:19:18:23
Speaker 3
With these boards behind me the games are endless. You can play checkers, chess even pool. They're called carrom boards. They originated in India, but they were Americanized and made here in Ludington for over 130 years. And you know why John's not here? Because he knows he would lose.

00:19:18:25 - 00:19:19:28
Speaker 1
Anywhere, are we?

00:19:20:00 - 00:19:24:04
Speaker 3
This is the only disc golf store within an hour drive any direction.

00:19:24:04 - 00:19:25:27
Speaker 1
It's called grip and rip disc golf.

00:19:26:02 - 00:19:27:09
Speaker 2
It's just kind of a scene, you know?

00:19:27:09 - 00:19:31:27
Speaker 3
It's like golfing. You grip it and you rip it. The discs grip it, let it fly.

00:19:31:27 - 00:19:34:24
Speaker 1
Right. Have you ever been in a store with this many frisbees?

00:19:34:26 - 00:19:41:16
Speaker 3
You know, don't ever call it a Frisbee, but it's different here. You use. This is what we need. We need a driver, a.

00:19:41:16 - 00:19:41:28
Speaker 1
Driver.

00:19:41:28 - 00:19:43:13
Speaker 3
A mid-ranger mid-ranger and a.

00:19:43:13 - 00:19:45:27
Speaker 1
Putter and a putter. These are our frisbees.

00:19:46:02 - 00:19:46:25
Speaker 3
They are our.

00:19:46:25 - 00:19:54:08
Speaker 1
Disc. These are our best. Yes. Here we go. You're practicing nice. And does it make a difference point wise if you get it wrong.

00:19:54:13 - 00:19:57:11
Speaker 3
And in his hand we got this good one.

00:19:57:11 - 00:19:58:01
Speaker 1
This is a good one.

00:19:58:01 - 00:19:58:12
Speaker 3
All right.

00:19:58:14 - 00:20:00:07
Speaker 1
We're here at the, What is this called?

00:20:00:07 - 00:20:01:05
Speaker 3
The box.

00:20:01:09 - 00:20:06:23
Speaker 1
And I'm telling you, you can't see the basket from here. You're good. You got to the tree.

00:20:06:25 - 00:20:09:18
Speaker 3
Oh, nice. Do you see it?

00:20:09:21 - 00:20:10:08
Speaker 1
Yeah, I see it.

00:20:10:10 - 00:20:13:24
Speaker 3
You do? Let's try to make it into that open field.

00:20:13:27 - 00:20:17:05
Speaker 1
Good. Unless there's another tree behind that. What did you hit?

00:20:17:07 - 00:20:23:05
Speaker 3
You know, this is like the county to play disc golfing. There's 14 courses.

00:20:23:05 - 00:20:26:24
Speaker 1
In the county. Yes, but in in 20 mile range.

00:20:26:25 - 00:20:27:15
Speaker 3
39.

00:20:27:17 - 00:20:39:21
Speaker 1
30. You've got it. The third largest course in the entire country is in Ludington. It's called Goliath.

00:20:39:24 - 00:20:41:04
Speaker 1
Cowherd. There we go.

00:20:41:06 - 00:20:42:12
Speaker 2
Oh, yeah.

00:20:42:14 - 00:20:51:04
Speaker 1
I'm, I'm about a half mile this way. Look at what you did. There you go. Good job, girl.

00:20:51:08 - 00:20:54:12
Speaker 3
And you don't have to be good to have fun because we had a lot of laughs.

00:20:54:12 - 00:20:55:17
Speaker 1
Obviously.

00:20:55:19 - 00:21:01:08
Speaker 3
Right. If we can play, anyone can play.

00:21:01:11 - 00:21:25:21
Speaker 3
If you want to experience all of the ecosystems that Michigan has to offer, this is the place to come. Ludington State Park You'll find beaches, forests, marshlands, sand dunes and wetlands. It's what makes this park so popular. Over 5000 acres, seven miles of shoreline and it's home to Big Sable Point Lighthouse, the last lighthouse on the Great Lakes to be electrified.

00:21:25:24 - 00:21:33:24
Speaker 3
Now I'm on this tree, I have to get down and I'm in a skirt. So, Brian? Cut the camera.

00:21:33:26 - 00:21:42:09
Speaker 6
50 years ago, everybody in Michigan knew what was going on behind that hill. Today people are like, oh, is that a landfill?

00:21:42:12 - 00:21:45:22
Speaker 1
Is that right? But you guys know exactly what's going on here.

00:21:45:23 - 00:21:51:00
Speaker 9
So what we have here is we have one of the largest pump storage hydroelectric facilities in the world.

00:21:51:02 - 00:21:53:22
Speaker 6
We're about 1.6 million customers we can serve.

00:21:53:22 - 00:22:11:12
Speaker 9
That was built from 1969 to 73. It comes from a lot of the technology from our original hydro plants. Yeah. Just used for a different purpose as a pump storage versus just as a traditional thing. You can see the six round circles. Yep. So each unit is a generating unit, but each unit is also a pump.

00:22:11:12 - 00:22:35:06
Speaker 9
We motorized its generator, turn the unit into a pump to actually take the water from the lake and put it into our upper reservoir for use later. It's essentially another means it's creating a battery in a mechanical form versus chemical form. The upper reservoir is five and a half miles surrounding the wall. It's two and a half miles from north to south, and it's about a mile straight across the other side of the wall that we're looking at across from us, 28 billion gallons of water.

00:22:35:09 - 00:22:38:19
Speaker 1
Water right from lake water is been treated it all. It's just.

00:22:38:19 - 00:22:43:04
Speaker 9
No treatment. Just pumped up and then released back to the units to generate with yeah.

00:22:43:06 - 00:22:44:02
Speaker 1
Is this the biggest.

00:22:44:06 - 00:22:46:23
Speaker 9
It is number six in the world as we speak.

00:22:46:26 - 00:22:55:02
Speaker 6
So we fill at night. And then during the day, when the demand starts to creep back up and load starts to creep back up, that's when we'll kick things off.

00:22:55:05 - 00:22:57:19
Speaker 9
This is actually the piece inside doing the work with the water.

00:22:57:19 - 00:22:58:12
Speaker 1
What is this call?

00:22:58:16 - 00:23:00:05
Speaker 9
This is called a runner turbine.

00:23:00:08 - 00:23:01:16
Speaker 1
How's it operate?

00:23:01:18 - 00:23:11:02
Speaker 9
So it spins around in one direction. The water flows through it to actually make the shaft spin to rotate the generator and the other direction, it actually acts as the impeller on the pump.

00:23:11:04 - 00:23:20:22
Speaker 6
We took the six blade units that we have here, and we replaced them with a nine blade unit. So we got an additional 50MW per unit.

00:23:20:25 - 00:23:23:07
Speaker 9
Which is why this visual aid is here for everybody to come see.

00:23:23:09 - 00:23:29:16
Speaker 1
It's nice that you have the ability to replace a huge environmental. How good is this?

00:23:29:16 - 00:23:45:22
Speaker 9
The most fuel we burn on a given day is in our maintenance trucks. Is it right? This. There's no combustion going on. It's just hydraulics. The electricity comes in over the high lines that you see there to actually operate the pumps. And then we actually generate put the power back on those lines. Yeah. So it doesn't really get any cleaner.

00:23:45:26 - 00:23:51:14
Speaker 1
It's really remarkable what goes on here. Absolutely. And there's a lot of these all over the world.

00:23:51:17 - 00:23:55:15
Speaker 9
There's actually very few. So in the continental United States there's roughly about 43.

00:23:55:21 - 00:23:57:10
Speaker 1
Why are there not more of these?

00:23:57:12 - 00:24:04:03
Speaker 9
The geographic challenge you have to have the height difference between the body of water that you're going to produce that water from. Yeah. In order to have your reservoir.

00:24:04:04 - 00:24:06:29
Speaker 1
Why don't we have this near my hometown of Milwaukee?

00:24:06:29 - 00:24:08:17
Speaker 9
I can't answer that.

00:24:08:19 - 00:24:10:11
Speaker 1
Well, could you call someone?

00:24:10:14 - 00:24:17:10
Speaker 3
Yeah. Come on.

00:24:17:13 - 00:24:20:29
Speaker 1
Emmy, what did you think of this town that was built on woods and water?

00:24:21:02 - 00:24:24:02
Speaker 3
I would totally come again.

00:24:24:04 - 00:24:29:10
Speaker 1
So water people waiting for. Well, that's. That's right.

00:24:29:10 - 00:24:31:03
Speaker 3
It rains.

00:24:31:10 - 00:24:38:27
Unknown
There's no one else. I'd rather be the heart and soul of communities right here.

00:24:39:01 - 00:24:42:18
Speaker 1
Take a look at that. If we miss it, we're done.

00:24:42:22 - 00:24:48:04
Speaker 3
We are breaking up.

00:24:48:06 - 00:24:51:07
Speaker 3
Take a bow. The lady's done for the day.

00:24:51:10 - 00:24:54:11
Speaker 1
You're like, king of, disc golf.

00:24:54:13 - 00:24:55:20
Speaker 3
I wish I knew who he was.

00:24:55:20 - 00:24:59:20
Speaker 1
She. She's.

00:24:59:22 - 00:25:06:27
Speaker 2
Maybe this is a good spot to stop.

00:25:07:00 - 00:25:13:04
