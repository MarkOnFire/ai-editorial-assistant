- John McGivern: I'm in a
charming Illinois village

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,338
that feels very rural,

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:08,375
even though I'm 35 miles
from downtown Chicago.

the underwriters

00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,213
of <i>John McGivern's Main Streets</i>

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,683
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,185
[gentle music]
- Yes,

9
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:21,922
Greendale is beautiful
on the outside.

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,459
But it's what's inside
that counts.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,463
Who doesn't love opening a door
to great food?

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,332
Whether you want to go casual,

13
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,335
upscale,

14
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:40,741
or maybe you wanna try something
brand new!

15
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,576
Come on in!

16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,445
You just gotta see Greendale.

17
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,482
- The Wisconsin Northwoods
are calling.

18
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,284
One word, one place.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,785
Minocqua.

20
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:56,423
- Your community's best
selfie spot is Your-Type!

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,059
[upbeat music]
- You'll find your bright spot

22
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,428
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

23
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,198
- My father taught me that
to make great bakery,

24
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,799
you have to do it the right way.

25
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:10,404
O&H Danish Bakery, where
kringle traditions begin.

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,206
- There's no place
like Oconomowoc.

27
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,107
Explore, play, shop, stay.

28
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,976

[bright music]

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,091
- I am in Illinois's first
historic district, Long Grove.

43
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,126
With a population
of about 8,400,

44
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,562
it is a northwest suburb
of Chicago.

45
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,963
It's just a little over an hour

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,000
from my hometown of Milwaukee,
and it sits dead center

47
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,602
between the cities
of Waukegan to the north,

48
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,173
Elgin to the west,
and Evanston to the east.

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,008
[bright music]

50
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,077
Emmy, how does a community
that's in the Chicago metro area

51
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,946
stay looking like this?

52
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,849
- Emmy Fink: Their plan was to
really maintain the rural charm

53
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,818
and countryside character
so that this beautiful town

54
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,088
always looks like it did
back in the early 1900s.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,423
So how they've done this,

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,725
they have limited
commercial development.

57
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,727
They've maintained a lot
of their open space,

58
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,630
and they've preserved all
these beautiful old buildings.

59
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,232
- John: What was it like
back then?

60
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,433
- It was really a crossroads

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,136
between Chicago and the
surrounding farmland.

62
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,205
This was actually the area
where a lot of farmers

63
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,639
would come and get
their supplies.

64
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,074
- And who were those farmers?

65
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,244
- Yankees from New England
and German immigrants.

66
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,046
- John: Okay.
- It was actually the Yankees

67
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,515
from New England
that named this town Long Grove

68
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,450
because of the long
grove of trees...

69
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,052
- John: Oh, nice.
- ...in the area.

70
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,820
The Germans, they
called it Muttersholtz.

71
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:07,988
- John: Muttersholtz.

72
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,890
- Yes, and it means
Mother's Woods.

73
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,291
- Oh, smart.
- Isn't that pretty?

74
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,093
And then you fast forward
to World War II,

75
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,430
and a lot of the farmers, they
moved to go serve in the war,

76
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,200
leaving behind their farming
supplies and their furniture.

77
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,368
Well, guess what?

78
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,769
At the same time--
- I'm thinking.

79
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:23,971
- Yeah, you know.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,172
- Wealthy people from Chicago,

81
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,841
they were just starting
this beautiful hobby of--

82
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,009
- Antiquing.
- Antiquing.

83
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,410
- Yeah.
- You got it.

84
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,613
So of course, this was one
of the earliest antiquing hubs,

85
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,914
and it still is.

86
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,950
- Which you reminded me,
I have so much shopping to do.

87
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,552
I'm going antiquing.
- No, we just started!

88
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,354
- I do, no, it's fine,
I'll be back.

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,389
Good seeing you!
- Oh, he's not coming back!

90
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,224
That's a big fat lie!

91
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,927
[bright music]

92
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:51,732
- Listen to the name of this
shop, Vintage Charm Homestead.

93
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,534
The name is so perfect.
- Gina Andaas: Yes.

94
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,135
- Because you know what
this shop is?

95
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,204
It's beautiful, it's pretty.

96
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,406
- Gina: It's everything I love.
- John: Oh, is it?

97
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,008
- It is. [laughs]
- There you go.

98
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,010
So this is--
- If I love it, it's here.

99
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,412
We have a little bit of old,
a little bit of vintage,

100
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,580
a little bit of antiques.

101
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,182
- John: What do
you think these are?

102
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,483
- Silver-plated
vintage flatware.

103
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,752
We take old vintage furniture
and give it a new look.

104
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,289
This china cabinet was like
that vintage deep brown color.

105
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,090
So we gave it
a new coat of paint.

106
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,293
It just gives it a nice,
pretty look inside.

107
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,594
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

108
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,796
- Gina: Put a color of gray
on it.

109
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,398
It just gives it new life.

110
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,900
If it's gonna make you
love it and enjoy it,

111
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,068
then you gotta do it.

112
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,469
- John: That's
really important too.

113
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,005
- Yeah, yeah, I love to share
what we're doing here

114
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,408
and teach other people what
to do what we love to do.

115
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,576
- John: Yeah.

116
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,311
- So we're gonna
stamp these coasters.

117
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,247
What you wanna do is lay it
with the textured side down.

118
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,582
- John: Sure.

119
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:46,787
- Then we're gonna use some ink,
a nice even coat on here.

120
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,355
You're probably good.

121
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,124
No pressure, just a
light rolling over it.

122
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,127
- And how do you know when
all of the design is done?

123
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,296
- Gina: Eh, you can see it.

124
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,464
Okay, I think you're good.

125
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,032
You got this.

126
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,201
Now, when you're ready,
you're gonna lay it down.

127
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,903
There you go.

128
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,705
So once it's on, you're just
gonna tickle around.

129
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,340
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
you said tickle it.

130
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,543
- Gina: Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- You ready?

131
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,278
- Oh, I love it.

132
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,247
- I did this one.

133
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,783
- Gina: See, you can
be creative. [laughs]

134
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,019
- John: Why don't
you have a television show?

135
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,754
[both laugh]

136
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,656
[upbeat music]

137
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,192
- Back when we started making
<i>John McGivern's Main Streets,</i>

138
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,228
if somebody had told me
that by the end of season four,

139
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:32,266
I would be visiting
two sock monkey museums,

140
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,835
I would've said,
"There is no such thing

141
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,204
as a sock monkey museum."

142
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:41,208
Wrong, the one here in Long
Grove, Illinois, is incredible.

143
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,745
The Guinness Book of World
Records has certified

144
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,415
that this place has
the largest collection

145
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,552
of handmade sock monkeys
of anywhere in the whole world.

146
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,887
- Okay, he is my absolute
favorite.

147
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,055
His name is Luno.

148
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,492
He's 92 years old,
the oldest sock monkey here.

149
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,696
Aw, this one kinda looks sad,
but he's got a great butt.

150
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,431
Now, she is fancy.

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,067
I think he'll fit in my car.

152
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,337
- Over 2,000, and not one
has the color palette

153
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,239
of <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets.</i>

154
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:16,210
I think they're missing
quite the opportunity.

Mary, this is, I love her job.

158
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,984
- Mary Prekop: I'm the keeper
of the brand.

159
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,352
I'm the one who protects

160
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,622
and makes sure that the name
Long Grove Confectionary

161
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,059
is always represented
in the best light.

162
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,329
We're celebrating
50 years in 2025.

163
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,099
Long Grove Confectionary has
continuously stayed open here

164
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,568
and has continuously
represented this town

165
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,203
with lots of pride.

166
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,973
You should eat this donut
right now.

167
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,140
- Thank you, Mary.

168
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,308
This is so good.

169
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,476
It was good.

170
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,078
- Mary: If you're
having a bad day

171
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,581
and Elsie's making donuts,
it makes everything better.

172
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,283
- John: So these are
apple cider donuts.

173
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,752
- Mary: It's like an apple pie,

174
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,020
but it's better.
- It's better.

175
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,956
Was there a camera rolling
on this?

176
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,559
Or do we need to do that again?

177
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,961
- This is the best part
of the job are these cases.

178
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,763
Somebody said, "Do you
ever get sick of it?"

179
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,432
And I'm like, "No,
I never get sick of that."

180
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,934
You could pace yourself,
John, silly.

181
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,302
- She don't know me.

182
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,571
This is heaven!
- Our myrtle.

183
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,173
- And you can't
use the other word

184
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,774
because that is--
- You can't; it's trademarked.

185
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,476
- I almost need a nap already.

186
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,512
- [laughs] I'm gonna
take you down here, John.

187
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,813
And this is our English toffee.

188
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,248
That English toffee is made

189
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,783
in copper kettles.
- Oh, my lord!

190
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,618
- I love the creativity.

191
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,854
- Yeah.
- That shows up in chocolate.

192
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,357
Part of the confectionary
industry is what's new.

193
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,194
Our peanut butter melt
with salt donuts,

194
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,363
brown bag apple pies,
jalapeño meltaway.

195
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,165
And that was a big thing
for a while.

196
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,733
- John: Salted caramel,
I'm like--

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,670
- Dark chocolate orange peel
is one of my very favorite.

198
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,471
Clearly, I really love it.
- It's all good!

199
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,874
- I really love my job.
- It's all good, we're like--

200
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,943
- Mary: Representing
and being the caretakers

201
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,846
of something that I remember
as a child.

202
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,683
This is the pride of my career,
is right here.

203
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,418
I have a lot of fun.

204
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,920
I am literally a kid
in the candy store.

205
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,022
I was trying
to avoid the cliché--

206
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,425
- But here you are.
- But yeah, I am.

207
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,227
- Emmy, sorry you're
not here today.

208
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,829
- No, we'll send a
goodie bag home for Emmy.

209
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,365
So Emmy, don't let them
eat it on the way home.

210
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,100
[John laughing]

211
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,036
- Long Grove is known for its
events and its festivals,

212
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,373
like Strawberry Fest and
Chocolate Fest and Vintage Days.

213
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,243
So even though only
8,400 people live here,

214
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,111
because of those events
and festivals,

215
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,014
guess how many people
visit here every year?

216
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,749
[playful music]

217
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,821
- Last year, over 109,000
people made their way

218
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,956
to Long Grove for their
different annual events.

219
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,928
Well, next year, make it
109,001, 'cause I'm in.

220
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,663
[gentle music]

221
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,267
- I walked in here thinking,
"So if this was my shop--"

222
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,269
- Rachel Perkal: Yeah?
- How do you do this?

223
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,271
- Oh, my gosh.
- Like, how does this happen?

224
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,473
- This, well,
this is a labor of love.

225
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,674
- John: Absolutely.
- Rachel: Okay?

226
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,075
But every single thing
in the store

227
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,011
has a reason for being here,

228
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,813
so everything has
a soul and a story.

229
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,317
- John: And is that soul and
story connected to you always?

230
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,319
- Rachel: Well, the
connection to me is

231
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,222
that I meet every single artist.

232
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,623
- No, really?
- Every single maker.

233
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,559
I know everybody by name.

234
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,561
- John: A connection to
something is always the best.

235
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,830
- Rachel: Absolutely, to have
something that is handmade

236
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,834
and unique and is different
from the one to the left

237
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,902
and different from the one
to the right,

238
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,572
that's a rare thing,
and that every week

239
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,407
something new is
coming into the store

240
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:37,211
so they'll never be disappointed
by not finding something new

241
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,813
or feeling like,
"I think I've seen it all."

242
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,149
Not in this store,
not in this store.

243
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,784
These are all message-driven.

244
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,321
You have wonderful artwork,
but you read these, so.

245
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:52,659
- In life, it's not where you
go, it's who you travel with.

246
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,827
Bats.
- Rachel: Bats.

247
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,429
- John: We have
to talk about 'em.

248
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,031
- Because our bats have become
kind of a signature item for us.

249
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,567
Our wind sculptures
are works of art.

250
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:04,071
Come out here on a day
that's breezy, and it's like

251
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,273
a firework display out here.
- John: A lot of movement.

252
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,276
- Rachel: What really sets us
apart is the relationships.

253
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,979
I always say that people
come in the door as customers

254
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,514
and they leave as friends.

255
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,716
- John: Nice.
- We hug a lot in this store.

256
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,718
- Do ya? [laughs]
- Yeah, people should be warned.

257
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,453
[bright music]

258
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,391
- The Robert Parker Coffin
Bridge, take a look at this.

259
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,895
It's been an icon here
in Long Grove since 1906.

260
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,429
So it would be really great

261
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,099
if cars would stop
running into it,

262
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,901
like driving into it.

263
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,703
They put the bridge covering on
back in the '70s,

264
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,406
and since then,
box trucks and buses,

265
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,608
they literally crash into it,

266
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,744
so much so that they
had to take it down

267
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,712
and reinforce it back in 2020.

268
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,849
But since then, there's
still been over 50 crashes.

269
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,951
In fact, right as we got here,

270
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,920
there was a sheriff
and a big box truck.

271
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,755
Do you see that piece
of wood hanging?

272
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,290
Yeah, that was his doing.

273
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,826
Read the sign, people,
8'6", no more.

274
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,566
- John: So it's the oldest
tavern in the state of Illinois.

275
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,934
- Nicole Jarvis-Wallace:
In continuous operation.

276
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,936
- Elaine Jarvis: Operation.
- Nicole: There we go, yeah.

277
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,103
- John: That's so great.

278
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,305
- Elaine: Yeah.
- Nicole: Yeah.

279
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,506
This building was
always a tavern.

280
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:13,907
1847, I believe,
is when it started.

281
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,109
We're the only, the fifth family
to own this place.

282
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,444
- This place is so charming.

283
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,147
We walked in, and we were just,
we fell in love with it.

284
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,483
We are happy to have you here,
and I am here to seat you.

285
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,085
- This room right here
was an addition

286
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,221
onto the original structure.

287
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,622
We kept a lot of the pictures

288
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,992
from what Long Grove looked like
back in the 1800s.

289
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,293
- The Long Grove baseball team.

290
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,329
It looks like it was
after a loss though.

291
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,097
[Nicole laughs]
Yeah.

292
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,699
I'm looking for Scott!

293
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,100
- Scott Wallace: Hey,
I'm over here.

294
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,936
- Can I have an apron?
- Of course.

295
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,104
- We're cooking.

296
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,106
Eight ounces.
- Eight ounces, yes, so--

297
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,908
- John: They're good?
- Put this on here.

298
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,077
It's about 350 degrees.

299
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,278
- John: Here's
your skirt steak.

300
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,347
- Get that going as well.
- John: Nice.

301
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,849
What can you not change
since you took over?

302
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,851
- Nicole: Been using
the same fish fry recipe

303
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,086
for over a hundred years.

304
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:02,322
- John: Is that right?
- Nicole: Yeah.

305
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,524
- John: Doesn't it smell good?

306
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,726
- Scott: It does.
- It's almost food time.

307
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,395
So your dad works here?
- Nicole: My dad works here.

308
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,797
- John: Your husband works here?
- Nicole: My husband works here.

309
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,000
- John: Your mom works here.
- Nicole: Mom works here.

310
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,801
We are a family business.
- Look at that.

311
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,770
We're having lunch.

312
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,474
That's delicious.

313
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:21,975
- Scott: Good burger, isn't it?

314
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,477
- Mm-hmm.
- Good job.

315
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,580
- I know that you just opened
up something downstairs.

316
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,582
- Nicole: Yes, a pool hall.

317
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,284
I met my husband at a pool hall,

318
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,386
and my parents actually met
at a pool hall, so.

319
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,620
- Elaine: In college.

320
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,689
- Hey, guys,
this place is very cool.

321
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,891
- Will Jarvis: Instead of just
having people come to dinner,

322
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,260
we would love to have 'em
come down and play pool.

323
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,662
- John: Spend a
little more time.

324
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,829
- Will: Exactly.

325
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,698
- John: So do you
have pool leagues?

326
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,899
- Will: We do, we have--

327
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,501
- John: And will
this place be packed

328
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:48,669
when the leagues meet?

329
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,070
- Will: Yes, yes.
- John: Yeah.

330
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,840
Can I take a shot?
- Will: Sure!

331
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,375
He just gave me a look.
[Will laughs]

332
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,711
- And here we go.
- Yeah.

333
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,681
[balls clack]
Kinda like that.

334
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,082
I believe you've played
this game--

335
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,550
- I'm Wisconsin's bank--
[both laughing]

336
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,751
- I think he's played before.

337
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,453
- I believe he played
this game before.

338
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,856
- Got 'em!
[both laughing]

339
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,457
- John: Family,
this has been a joy.

340
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,060
- Will: Thank you for having us.
- John: Thank you so much.

341
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,029
- This flagpole has been here
since 1954.

342
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:19,499
But before that, it stood
at the Long Grove residence

343
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,768
of terrible Terry Druggan.

344
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,904
He was a Chicagoland gangster.

345
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,974
Now, why would a gang leader
need a big flagpole, you ask?

346
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,743
Well, it was not
to fly his Cubby flag.

347
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,246
No, it was used
as a signal to Terry.

348
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,614
If the flag was up,

349
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,782
it meant everything was good
in the neighborhood,

350
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,417
but if the flag was down,

351
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,586
it meant someone
was looking for him,

352
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,989
and he should probably
just keep driving.

353
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,157
Now, he may have
been terrible, right?

354
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,660
But he sounds like a
pretty smart gangster to me,

355
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,364
and flag is up, so Terry,
come on back.

356
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,168
- John: So that's a true story?
- John Kopecky: It's a, yeah.

357
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,369
- So you know these stories

358
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,271
because obviously
you were raised here?

359
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,473
- Yes, I had my first drink
in The Village Tavern.

360
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,074
- What are we
standing in front of?

361
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,210
- John K: This house
is the Wagner House.

362
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,511
They call it The Farmhouse.

363
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,747
And this house dates
from the 1840s,

364
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,882
and it is just the way it was.

365
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,585
- This is now a part of the
historical society?

366
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,054
- It is, this is where
the historical society

367
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,355
meets in the basement.

368
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,824
- John: And has this town
had its ups and its downs?

369
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,626
- John K: Oh, sure, yeah.
- John: Yeah.

370
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,794
And where are we today?

371
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,796
- John K: I think
we're on the way up.

372
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,098
We had business owners throw in,

373
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,502
and then we created
merchant organizations.

374
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,838
The one now is
working really well.

375
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,273
- John: We're only, like,
35 miles from Chicago, yes?

376
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,677
- John K: Yes, it's an
open spaces kind of a mandate.

377
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,013
It's, I think, in the charter
of our town.

378
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,550
Our park district is
well-funded, which is great.

379
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,620
And it's all volunteer, like
our village is all volunteer.

380
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,088
- John: Yeah,
it's a small town,

381
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,225
but with a kind of a big
wide reputation, isn't it?

382
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,227
- John K: It's just
a fun spirit in town.

383
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,562
Well, I think people
come out here to be themselves,

384
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,931
and that's pretty much
what you get.

385
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:01,335
It's a special place.
- John: Yeah.

386
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,437
- Isn't this church
just darling?

387
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:07,241
I bet you wouldn't believe
it's 176 years old.

388
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,244
Let's rewind all the way back
to 1840s

389
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,612
when the German settlers came

390
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,146
and they formed
this congregation

391
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,948
and they built this
beautiful church.

392
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,552
They named it the
German United Evangelical

393
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,188
Lutheran Reform Church
of Long Grove.

394
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,024
My guess is that every
parishioner got to pick a word,

395
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,627
and they threw it in a hat
and then mixed it all together.

396
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,695
Well, somewhere along the line,
they shortened the name

397
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,664
to Long Grove Community Church.

398
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,865
It's still very active.

399
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,033
They have weekly services,

400
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,236
and it's one of the most
in-demand wedding venues.

401
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,971
And I do see why.

402
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,874
[upbeat music]

403
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,676
- John: We're at a place
called Brothers Field.

404
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,478
- Jesse DeSoto: All this area
here was the

405
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,347
Red Oaks Furniture Company in
Long Grove for about 70 years.

406
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,749
- John: What's Brothers Field?

407
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,351
- Well, Brothers Field is kind
of what we call a COVID baby.

408
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,519
None of this was here.

409
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,921
We had just demolished
all that building.

410
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,789
It was just field,
and my brother and I,

411
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:58,892
we would sit here
with a fire pit and some music,

412
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,594
and people just started coming.

413
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:02,996
I think my brother had the idea
to run a community movie

414
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,899
on the side of that green barn
with that massive screen,

415
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,203
and after the response
was so positive from that,

416
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,871
we just, we've been
growing ever since.

417
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,472
- John: It's good
people are showing up.

418
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,074
- Jesse: That's right,
people are showing up,

419
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,475
and we're seeing it continue
to grow.

420
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,311
When things changed
in '08 and '12,

421
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,879
the furniture company
didn't fare as well

422
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,814
with how people
changed their shopping,

423
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:22,516
and they closed down,

424
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,117
and we ended up
picking up the property.

425
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,719
I wanted that building
for the dance studio,

426
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,321
'cause it's got these
cathedral ceilings, high.

427
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,722
- John: Gorgeous.

428
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,924
- I remember I walked in, and
it's all furniture scattered.

429
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,526
And I go, "This
is a dance studio.

430
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:34,328
It just doesn't know it yet."
- John: Right.

431
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,495
First of all, there's something

432
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,864
incredibly intimidating
about all of that.

433
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,031
- The ballroom dancing?

434
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,233
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

435
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,235
- It's like, "No, I'm not
doing that, you know!"

436
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,836
He's gotta be crazy
thinking I'm gonna dance.

437
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,004
I'm not dancing.

438
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,172
Emmy's gonna dance.

439
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,573
Good luck, girl!
- This hand here

440
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,975
is gonna go right under my
shoulder.

441
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,776
I'm gonna put my hand
right on your shoulder.

442
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,578
- Oh, under your shoulder.
- Just like that.

443
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,980
- Okay.
- So far so good?

444
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,281
- Yeah.
- Okay.

445
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,483
I got started with the dance
industry in March of '99,

446
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,085
so just over 25 years.
- In Milwaukee?

447
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,353
- Jesse: In Milwaukee.

448
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,154
- John: That's not when
you started dancing though.

449
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,156
- Jesse: Yeah, actually it is.
- John: In '99.

450
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,559
- I took my first rumba
box step in March of 1999.

451
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:06,960
It was probably
about two years in

452
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,363
that I decided this was
where I was gonna put my time

453
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,764
and focus.
- So is Fred Astaire

454
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,065
all about ballroom?
- Jesse: Ballroom,

455
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,467
it's waltzes, tangos, cha-chas,
swings, Latin dances,

456
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,869
country dances, polkas,
anything you can think of.

457
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,137
- John: That has a partner.

458
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,339
- That has a partner working,
with them in it, yep.

459
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,541
As soon you get the mind--

460
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,342
- Yeah, I'm trying to pretend
I'm Julianne Hough.

461
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,545
- You're doing a great job,
just great job at that.

462
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,280
It's scary for people to begin.

463
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,148
I say the hardest thing
in learning to dance

464
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,750
is the first step,
but once you're there

465
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,318
and you get the right people,

466
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,353
people say, "I can't
believe I waited so long."

467
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,022
- Oh, that's so fancy, Jesse!

468
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,124
- You're turning.
[laughing]

469
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,726
- John: Lemme tell you, the
movement and watching this,

470
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,096
like, how do you learn
to be just so beautiful?

471
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,299
- Jesse: Well, again, you know,
you start with one step.

472
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,301
- I'm out of breath.
[Jesse laughing]

473
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,468
- No joke.

474
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,070
- Whatever it might be,
these are skills.

475
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,673
If you break 'em down
into repetitive actions,

476
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,374
and you do it over
and over again.

477
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,909
Great job.
- This is so fun!

478
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:57,711
- You're picking up quick,
you're picking up quick.

479
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:00,113
Some people are into it more
for the dance, like the art,

480
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,915
and I do love the dance
and the art,

481
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,017
but I really, I'm about
what it does for people.

482
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,687
People make friends here,
and the business owners here

483
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,889
are what makes this place
as connected as it is.

484
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,824
Creating a nightlife,
creating entertainment,

485
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,826
creating activities
that are engaging

486
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,362
where people have to show up,
community conversations

487
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,464
and making friends
and meeting new people.

488
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:18,632
- John: It's a community.

489
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,535
- Jesse: It's a
wonderful community.

490
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,504
- Whew, water break!

491
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,908
[dramatic music]
[Jesse laughs]

492
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,710
- John: We are at
Buffalo Creek Brewing.

493
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,078
This place excites me; why?

494
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,914
Well, I've been in recovery
for 34 years,

495
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:37,284
and this place has a large
selection of craft sodas.

496
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,153
Do you know what bubblegum
flavor is? I bet you don't.

497
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,558
Banana, cherry, strawberry
makes bubblegum.

498
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:51,298
I hope there are some open
cup holders in our crew van.

499
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,933
That's what I'm hoping.

500
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,434
[gentle music]

501
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,036
You started this place in '82.

502
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,472
- Marian Ward: I did, yeah,
1982, mm-hmm.

503
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,474
- You look terrific.
- Oh, shoot. [laughs]

504
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,808
- You do!
- Oh, thanks.

505
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,344
- Is it what it was today
what it was then?

506
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,512
- Oh, no.
- No.

507
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,680
- No, everything was different.

508
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,081
You have to change
with the times,

509
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,651
so I think my taste is pretty
universal, is what I've found.

510
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,653
- John: Very good.
- Marian: So it feels like

511
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,655
if I like it, the majority
of people like it.

512
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,889
It seems to work.

513
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,091
So if you look around,
you can see we always have

514
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,994
great candle lines
and pillows and home decor.

515
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,930
We seasonally change.

516
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,164
- So what is this?

517
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,333
- So this is just
this wonderful line.

518
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,568
It's called Nora Fleming.

519
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,370
Every piece, we call these
base pieces, has a hole.

520
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,673
- John: And all together,
how many pieces are there?

521
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,274
- Marian: I think there's
about 200 minis.

522
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,076
- John: Okay.
- Marian: And then she probably

523
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:37,244
has about 30 base pieces.

524
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:39,446
- Do you have these at home?
- Oh, you, yes!

525
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,248
- You do?
- Of course, I love it.

526
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,450
- Okay, why'd you gimme that
look, like "Why wouldn't I?"

527
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,852
- Because of course
I would, yes.

528
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,620
- So upstairs,
it's all about baby.

529
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,455
- All about baby,
and it's grown.

530
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,524
So we're kind of a
destination for baby.

531
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,125
There's not a lot
of baby boutiques anymore.

532
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,728
So we tend to service
a lot of communities.

533
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,964
People come from all over
for our baby.

534
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,700
So this is baby land up here.
- It certainly is.

535
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,903
- Yeah, we specialize up to
about newborn to two years old,

536
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,738
but we do go up to 5T.

537
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,740
This is our little junior
pro shop over here,

538
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,842
all the golf and tennis clothes
for babies.

539
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,377
- John: Junior pro shop.
[laughs]

540
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:11,778
- So this little sweater--
- Yes!

541
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,580
- We've carried this
sweater for over 20 years,

542
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,182
and it's probably one
of our most popular.

543
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:16,350
Feel how soft it is.

544
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,951
- Do you know if
they make adult?

545
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:19,119
- I wish they did.

546
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,521
- Size 34x34 pants?
- Yeah. [laughs]

547
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,755
I wish they did, yeah.

548
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,023
That would be nice, huh?

549
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,425
- John: Is it a lot of
locals who shop here?

550
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,227
- Marian: Mm-hmm, that was
kind of my goal.

551
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,829
I wanted to be the
neighborhood gift shop.

552
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:29,997
And I have great customers.

553
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,598
That's what's kept me going
all these years.

554
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,200
They know they can find
something good here.

555
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,401
- 'Cause that's
what you provide.

556
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:35,802
- 'Cause that's what
we provide, yeah.

557
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,004
- Yeah, it's a beautiful shop.

558
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,405
- Marina: Thank you.
- John: Yeah.

559
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:39,573
Forty-two years says it all.

560
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,409
- Marian: Forty-two years, yeah.
- John: Yeah.

561
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,611
Do you know what
Hollywood star grew up

562
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,413
in Long Grove, Illinois?

563
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,815
Yeah, come here, closer.

564
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,317
I'll give you a hint.

565
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:53,654
She made a big splash
in the '80s.

566
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:57,591
Good hint.
[playful music]

567
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,161
- Don't you remember the
mermaid who saves Tom Hanks?

568
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,096
Now you got it, Daryl Hannah.

569
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,265
She grew up right here
in Long Grove.

570
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,367
Some of her other movies,
<i>Kill Bill,</i>

571
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,770
<i>Blade Runner,</i>
and <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

572
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,271
And if I was in charge,

573
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,274
I'd put her Hollywood star
right here.

574
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,009
[gentle music]

575
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,179
- Gerri Gwarnicki: So the
whole idea is very British.

576
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,848
- Gerri, we're
making tea, yes?

577
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,182
- We are making tea.

578
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:23,784
- John: How did you
get into this?

579
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,586
- Gerri: My culture, my--
- John: Your culture.

580
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,588
- Gerri: Grew up with this.
- John: So nice.

581
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,189
- Gerri: In the parlor
every Sunday afternoon.

582
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:31,258
Very British, British tradition,
although I am Irish.

583
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:35,128
And then we stir this,
and that is our tea.

584
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,297
Shall we move

585
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,899
to the lovely table--
- John: Sure, please.

586
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,501
- And, hello, Emmy,
nice to meet you.

587
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,302
- Say hello.
- Nice to meet you, Gerri.

588
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,104
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

589
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:46,306
When people come in here,
how long do they typically stay?

590
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,909
Is it like an hour?
- An hour and a half to two.

591
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,110
Yes, because it
is an experience.

592
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:51,311
Look at what we're doing, yes.

593
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,913
And you have a lovely,
beautiful English cup.

594
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,314
No clinking, none of this.
[spoon clinking]

595
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,682
- Oh, none of that.

596
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,452
- You must stir it without
making any noise in the china.

597
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,054
And this is just a little
etiquette of tea time.

598
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,657
And here is how
we hold our teacup.

599
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,960
We must never put our finger
through the loop of the teacup.

600
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,128
- Okay.
- What?

601
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:11,098
- Pinky in, pinky out.
[laughs]

602
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,667
Now we sip the tea.

603
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,269
- I'm very nervous.
- We did good.

604
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:19,139
- I wanna put my finger
through that hole.

605
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,408
I wanna slurp, and I wanna make

606
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:22,609
some noise.
- It's not funny.

607
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,811
- John: So what has to be
at a high tea?

608
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:27,981
- Gerri: Oh, what has to be
at a high tea is a scone.

609
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,751
- A scone.
- And the cucumber sandwiches

610
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,686
and a variety
of finger sandwiches,

611
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,756
all the lovely accoutrements
that make up the setting.

612
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,558
You would be surprised
how many people do this.

613
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:38,959
[spoon clanking]

614
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,627
We must not do this, so--

615
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,829
- We wouldn't dream of it.
- No clinking, no clinking.

616
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:44,031
- Do you tell everybody that

617
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,832
when they come in here,
or are you just--

618
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,000
- They pretty much know.

619
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,402
- John: And everything
that comes out

620
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:51,138
and that is on the table,
you make here yourselves.

621
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,372
- Gerri: Everything
made in-house.

622
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,807
- John: So great.
- Gerri: Everything.

623
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,008
Very proper, very English.

624
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,210
It's meant to be this.

625
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:57,644
It's meant to be
like an experience.

626
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,347
- Yes, very nice.
- And you take that little bite.

627
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:01,515
You trust me, John.

628
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,383
- Gerri, fantastic instruction.

629
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,885
- And a little sip of tea--

630
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,486
- Beautiful scone.
- Together with the dryness

631
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,288
of the scone, and you'll
get the whole idea

632
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,990
of how all this works together.

633
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,625
Now what should we have?

634
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,193
Do you want to try the cucumber?

635
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,394
- John: Please.
- Emmy: Yes.

636
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,996
Can we use the--
- Can we try?

637
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,632
Who thought
of a cucumber sandwich?

638
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,667
- Isn't it?
- Delicious, yeah.

639
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,136
- Gerri: I wanna be
authentically British.

640
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:26,273
I wanna do what is the way
it should be done.

641
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,444
And it's really a pleasure
to see the joy in people

642
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,546
and to make people happy.

643
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:33,780
- That's good, yeah.

644
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,149
- My goodness, and where is
John's hat?

645
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,552
See, it's on you, where is--
- Don't worry about it, Gerri.

646
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,654
[Emmy laughs]
- Enjoy.

647
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,490
- Howdy, pardner.
- Gerri: He's so funny.

648
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,359
Let's not lose our manners.

649
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,294
We won't be invited back
to the Queen.

650
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,029
[Emmy laughs]

651
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:51,698
- If you're thinking
Long Grove would be

652
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,867
a wonderful place
for a Christmas movie,

653
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,370
lemme tell you, this village
has already figured that out.

654
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,572
There have been four
Christmas movies filmed here.

655
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,441
In fact, the last one,
starring Mario Lopez,

656
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,243
wrapped two weeks ago.

657
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,511
So if you're a film producer

658
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:07,848
thinking of shooting a
Christmas movie in this town

659
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,384
and in the cast is a TV host,

660
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:14,421
I'm your guy.

661
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,090
I'm waiting for your call.

662
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,825
[upbeat music]

663
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,428
- Did you enjoy your time
in Long Grove?

664
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:22,829
- I did,
but I learned something.

665
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,431
- What?
- I learned that next time

666
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:27,034
I come here, I'm gonna bring
a cart or some sort of wagon.

667
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,602
And could you do me a favor?

668
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,204
- What?
- You're one of the best.

669
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,405
Would you go get my car?

670
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,407
- Ugh.
- Yeah, thank you, co-host.

671
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,008
- Wow.
- Oh, she is so good.

672
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,410
I love her.
- Emmy: You're welcome.

673
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,578
- Get the car!

674
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,380
? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

675
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:44,218
? The heart and soul
of community's right here ?

676
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,019
- Ah, this is not a good start.

677
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,788
- Oh.
[groans]

678
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:51,325
- Nice high-lifted bootie.
[laughs]

679
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:53,861
Dum, D-U-M.

680
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,896
- What's with the attitude?

681
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,064
Are you--
[laughs]

682
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,667
- Yeah, over here.
- Where's the mark?

683
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:03,637
Get outta here!

684

- Announcer: We thank
the underwriters

685
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,810
of <i>John McGivern's Main Streets</i>

686
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:13,580
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

687
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:14,882
[gentle music]
- Yes,

688
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,619
Greendale is beautiful
on the outside.

689
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,356
But it's what's inside
that counts.

690
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:26,260
Who doesn't love opening a door
to great food?

691
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:29,129
Whether you want to go casual,

692
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,232
upscale,

693
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:37,738
or maybe you wanna try something
brand new!

694
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,473
Come on in!

695
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,342
You just gotta see Greendale.

696
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,312
- The Wisconsin Northwoods
are calling.

697
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,147
One word, one place.

698
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,549
Minocqua.

699
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:53,253
- Your community's best
selfie spot is Your-Type!

700
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,756
[upbeat music]
- You'll find your bright spot

701
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:58,292
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

702
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,094
- My father taught me that
to make great bakery,

703
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,696
you have to do it the right way.

704
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:07,167
O&H Danish Bakery,
where kringle traditions begin.

705
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,936
- There's no place
like Oconomowoc.

706
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:11,004
Explore, play, shop, stay.

707
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,873
Visit Oconomowoc.

[imitates British accent]
We'll be seated now.

Looks like my uncle.
