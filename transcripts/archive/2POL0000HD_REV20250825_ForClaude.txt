- Polka emerged in
central Europe around the 1840s.

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,503
Exactly how
is something of a mystery,

109
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,473
but its name can be traced
to a pair of Slavic words.

110
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,877
The world "Polka" essentially
means Polish woman,

111
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,613
like "Polák" is a Polish man.

112
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,582
Although there's a Czech word

113
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,952
"pulka" that means sort of half,

114
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,888
and there is kind of
a half step in the polka

["Oh Suzanna Schottische"]

117
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,029
- Like the word
itself,

118
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,732
the story of
how polka began
is murky.

119
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,334
But most common

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,669
is the legend about
a peasant girl in Bohemia

121
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:07,841
who spontaneously invented
the dance in front of her boss.

122
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,911
- She's usually
a Czech or a Polish girl

123
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,747
and her boss is usually
a German or Austrian,

124
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,016
and he notes it down some way

125

and spreads it all around.

126
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,255
- There isn't much
historical evidence

127

to support this origin story.

128
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,158
It's more likely

129
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,696
that polka emerged
out of another couples' dance.

[waltz music]

- To Europe's cultured society,

133
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,808
the waltz was scandalous.

134
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,278

to wrap arms around each other.

the waltz lost that shock value,

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,337
- Because it was
the music and dance that

164
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,307
was popular in their homeland
at the time they emigrated,

165
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,110
it became their heritage here.

- Today, Wisconsin's identity
is closely tied

168
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,323
to the cultures
of its European immigrants.

to the cultures

Sometimes in
wonderfully apparent ways.

One of Wisconsin's
most charming small towns

is New Glarus.

173
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,306
Founded by Swiss immigrants
in the 1840s,

174
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,175
New Glarus not only
looks like the old world,

175
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,144
it celebrates
the old traditions.

176
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,080
One of those, of course,
is polka.

in New Glarus
attracts thousands of people.

180
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,429
For some, the event is personal.

181
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,733
- Polka, Swiss music,

182
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,170
makes me think
of my mom and my dad

183
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,606
and my heritage.

184
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,375
My mother was from Switzerland.

She lived to be 101,
eight months and 28 days.

186
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,779
She had a great spirit,
and she loved to dance,

She had a great spirit,
and she loved to dance,

At an event like this,

you can't help but think
of your old family members

and family fun times, really.

195

- I come here every year.

00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,079
Sit and enjoy, and meet people,

197

and drink beer
and listen to the music.

198
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,952
- 95 year-old New Glarus

199
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,021
is a true polka lover.

200
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,722
For over half a century,

201
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,724
dancing was
one his great passions.

202
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,725
- Oh, boy.

203

- Oh, boy.

204
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,864
I miss it now because
my legs won't let me.

205
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,299
I really miss it.

So I come and listen to it.

00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,102
It's my background, Swiss.

208

Hey!

210
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,915
- The polka festival is a link

211
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,184
to New Glarus's Swiss heritage.

212
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,554
People can sample
local-made cheese,

213
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,323
beer,

214
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,091

Half a block from the main tent,

Puempel's Olde Tavern
is also a part of the festival.

["Baby Doll Polka"]

218
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,605
Puempel's was established
in 1893,

219
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,342
and has hardly changed
in all that time.

220
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,678
On a floor
that's over a century old,

221
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,981
there isn't much room
for dancing.

222
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,216
But that doesn't stop
these polka lovers

223
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,752
from making the most of it.

224
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,563
The culture
of the Swiss immigrants

225
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,899
is alive and well in New Glarus,

226
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,935
and a vital part of their
tradition is polka.

[cheers and applause]

But New Glarus
certainly isn't the only place

230
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,815
you can experience
a great polka festival.

231
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:53,587
They happen throughout the year
in every corner of the state.

232
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,323
One of the most popular
polka festivals in Wisconsin,

233
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,093
and possibly the country, takes
place right here in Pulaski.

?

235
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,632
Pulaski was settled
by Polish immigrants,

236
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,534
who transformed its rocky soil

237
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,205
into the vibrant farmlands
surrounding the town today.

238
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,308
But Poles brought more than
agricultural skill to this area.

239
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,643
They also brought their music.

240
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,279
And in 1978,
a festival was launched

241
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,349
that has become an institution.

00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,586
Pulaski Polka Days
is a four-day event

that attracts
thousands of people.

- I initially came up here
with a bunch of friends.

And then I told my family,
told my aunt, my mom and dad.

And they said, "Oh! We're gonna
have to go next year."

which attract a new audience.

279
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,192
- The Polish style has

280
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,362
a much more syncopated beat,

281
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:20,334
big amps, electric bass guitars,
and loud drumming.

282
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,836
A loud sound.

283
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,639
It has a lot more
in common with rock

284
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:28,141
than the other polka styles.

285
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,944
There's kind of
a generation gap sometimes

286
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,214
with the people who don't like
the music to be that loud.

287
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,317
It's one of the reasons
that the Polish style

288
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,219
has kept a younger audience.

289

?

290
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,830
- Many of the young people
dance in the hop style,

291
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:53,000
which came out of
the Polish community.

292
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,935
- You dance in double time
to the music.

One,two,three, hop!
One,two,three, hop!

294
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,377
- This new generation of dancers
is one reason

295
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,979
Pulaski Polka Days is so unique.

296
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,581
- Harold, I know
you're a polka fan.

297

I'm a polka fan.

298
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,883
Why do you think this festival

299
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,319
is so important
to the polka industry?

300
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,754
- If you come to Pulaski,

301
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,722
you're gonna see the
younger generation coming out.

302
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,158
And that means a lot
because a lot of our old friends

303
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,127
are now 70, 80 years old.

304
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,596
And we've got the younger
generation involved in it.

305
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:26,600
And I tell you, it's a great
honor to see that here.

306
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,837
- Pulaski's famous festival
is a joyful reflection

307
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,505
of its Polish pedigree.

308
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:32,940
- People are

309
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,142
just very uninhibited

310
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,046
in terms of enjoying themselves,

enjoying one another,
and just having a great time.

have always played in polkas,

482
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,601
since I was eight years old

483
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,436
and her also.

484
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,939
And we said we'd never want
our kids to get into polkas

485
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,740
just because we know
the travel and stuff.

486
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,509
It's a lot of work.

487
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:57,878
- But the Vinecki family
started playing polka music

488
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:01,582
at local nursing homes,
and people loved them.

489
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,217
Things snowballed from there,

490
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:05,686
and now they're playing
around the country.

- But what do the kids
think of all this?

493
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,028
- Since we grew up
on polka music

494
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,296
that has been our thing.

495
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:18,131
And plus with just my dad
playing accordion,

496
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,499
it just all worked out.

497
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,502
- It's fun to
just do it as a family

498
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,769
and interact with each other.

499
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,705
It's not stressful.
- No, it's not stressful at all.

500
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,840
- It's not like,
"Ugh, mom and dad are with us."

501
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,408
It's like,
"Oh, these are my cool parents

502
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,043
who play and still look young!"

503
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,879
- Yeah, they're young
and awesome looking

504
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,580
so it's like,
"Yeah, you can tag along!"

505
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,115
- I love it, I do.

506
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,518
I mean a lot of people
are kind of questioning us like,

507
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,987
"How do you guys travel so much?

508
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,389
How is it, all of you
being together 24/7?"

509
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:44,024
But we have a good time.

510
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,393
I mean, we're making memories
everywhere we go.

it's a little bit better,
it's a little bit better.

I'm proud, as a father, to know

Here we go: Box! On!
Box! On!

519
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:08,448
- Rick and Alicia
have a talented polka family.

520
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:11,418
Alicia comes from one herself.

521
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:17,391
- Her family formed
a Mexican band in the early 70s.

522
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,893
Alicia's mom
was of Mexican descent,

523
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,662
her dad of Polish.

524
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:22,829
Her brother Hank remembers

525
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,531
grandmother's
fateful suggestion.

526
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:26,533
- Hey, you guys are learning
all this Mexican stuff.

527
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,535
Hey, remember,
you are hunkies, too.

528

You're from the old country.
You're Polish.

529
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,072
You gotta learn
some Polish songs.

530
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,875
So we started to learn
a couple Polish tunes for her.

calling themselves
The Polka Family Band.

But their appearance
threw audiences for a loop.

556

Hank and his sister Alicia

from their parents.

558

Alicia and Rick passed it along

It's a musical circle of life

- Oh, yeah.

571
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,468
Feet were always tapping, and

572
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,871
as soon as they could find the
instrument, they picked it up

573
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,507
and went and practiced
and practiced.

574
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:47,841
- We practiced anywhere.

575

"Oh, well now Randy's

638
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,710
after they'd just packed up.

639
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,179
And that's all they took
was my accordion.

640
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,682
Did it ever get returned?
- No. [laughing]

641
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:45,352
Speaking of accordion jokes,
it's an honest to God truth.

642
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,688
Someone actually
stole an accordion,

643
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:49,089
they didn't put one in.

644
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,824
?

645
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,498
- Perhaps more than
any other instrument,

646
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,901
the accordion is associated
with polka music.

647
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,338
- They don't call it the
"stomach Steinway" for nothing.

648
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:07,407
You can take an accordion,
play by yourself,

649
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:10,110
and sound like a whole band.

650
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,278
- It's the only instrument

651
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:13,814
that you can start a party
all by yourself.

652
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,249
I can't do it with a trumpet.

653
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,117
- But I can!

654
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,852
["Sneaky Pete"]

655
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:23,357
The accordion actually
is a classical instrument.

656
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:27,394
The United States is probably
the last country on earth

657
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:29,963
that considers an accordion

658
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,698
anything but classical

659
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:35,836
and has probably
the largest stereotypes.

660
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:38,205
Okay, if you play the accordion,
you're fat

661
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:40,207
and you've got to have
lederhosen.

662
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:41,942
?

663
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,045
[whistles sharply]

664
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,748
- So how is an accordion
different

665
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,616
than a concertina?

666
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:55,389
- The word in German for chord,
a musical chord,

667
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:56,924
is Akkord.

668
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,660
And so an Akkordeon
is an instrument

669
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:02,629
where you can press one button
and get a chord.

670
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,364
[plays chords]

671
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,867
And on a concertina,

672
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:09,069
you just get
one note per button regardless.

673
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:11,371
So if you want to make a chord,

674
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:13,006
you have to press
two or more buttons.

675
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:15,342
- When they were first made,
they just had

676
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:19,112
relatively few buttons,
if you will, on each side.

677
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,181
When they added more octaves,

678
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:23,884
they left those existing buttons
where they were

679
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,419
and they filled in around that.

680
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:28,655
- Kind of like
the letters on a keyboard.

681
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,592
You know, they're not in
alphabetical order or anything,

682
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:33,427
they're just based on usage.

683
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:34,828
- Don't you think that the guy

684
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:37,030
that really put them together
had to be drinking a lot?

685
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:38,899
- I think so.
[laughing]

686
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,534
- There's really
no rhyme or reason

687
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:42,135
to what the pattern
on the things are.

688
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:44,738
I never could figure it out.

689
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:47,808
- No matter where the buttons
are, Karl Hartwich,

690
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,511
from Galesville, Wisconsin,
has certainly figured out

691
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,546
how to play the concertina.

692
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:55,415
- He is the best
concertina player that I know

693
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,184
on the face of this earth.

694
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,919
He plays so well.

695
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,523
- Aw, thank you, Jim.
- I oftentimes--

696
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,024
- Aw! [smooch]
- [chuckles good-naturedly]

697
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,759
?

698
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:10,898
- Karl was attracted to
the instrument from a young age.

699
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:14,501
- I grew up with it
when I was a little kid,

700
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:16,937
and I've just always loved
the sound of the concertina.

701
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:19,840
It's got a nice
reedy sound to it.

702
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:22,509
When I was five, six years old,
I decided I wanted to play

703
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,611
either concertina or accordion,

704
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,213
and I decided to go
with the concertina.

705
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,948
And I'm glad I did.

706
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:33,887
Because they just seem like
they're more fun than accordion.

707
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,722
- Molly B: It's "Eddie's Waltz."

708
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,292
- Hey, hey!
- Mark on the clarinet.

709
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,727
Karl and Jim
on the concertinas.

710
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,763
- Just think:
three down!

711
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:45,766
- Polka players are easy-going
on the stage.

712
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:47,401
- I wish you "sto lat."

713
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,103
Sto lat, just like
the shirt says, sto lat.

714
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,207
That means "May you live
one hundred years!" in Polish.

715
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:57,044
- And they love
interacting with their crowd.

716
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,680
- How many people
paid to get in here today?

717
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:02,516
You were charged way too much!
[laughing]

718
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,352
- One of the things
about polka bands

719
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,322
is they have
a very close relationship

720
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,190
to their audience.

721
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,094
- Are you having fun, Bob?

722
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,565
Is everybody having fun?
- [audience cheers]

723
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,033
- There's a strong connection

724
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,302
between the musicians
and their audiences.

725
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,137
They're not haughty,

726
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:27,541
they're not up
on an elevated stage.

727
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,477
- You're a regular guy or gal.

728
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:31,678
You'll be out there

729
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:36,149
helping lug the amps
and hooking up the cords.

730
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:37,818
- Test one, two, check.

731
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,586
- Testing one, two, one, two.

732
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:42,389
- Just like everybody else.

733
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:46,793
- Musicians are
the heart and soul of polka.

734
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,096
But only a few
manage to do it full time.

735
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:51,698
And none of us
are driving Ferraris.

736
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:54,301
- Well, I gave up
on the first million,

737
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:57,304
I'm working on the third.
[laughing]

738
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,706
Never happen, will it?
- No.

739
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,675
- Not the way you pay!
[laughing]

740
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:04,912
- You cannot make millions
of dollars on polka music, no.

741
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:06,847
This is a hobby that we enjoy,

742
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:09,049
and everybody's
got regular jobs.

743
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:12,085
So we come back
to the real world on Monday.

744
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,887
Dragging your feet.

745
00:34:13,954 --> 00:34:15,222
[sighing melodramatically]
Uggghh!

746
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,957
?

747
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,060
- A lot of times,
we don't get home

748
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,229
'til 3 or 4 or 5 o'clock
in the morning

749
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:24,498
and go home, take a shower,
and go right to work.

750
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,333
- A typical gig,

751
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,101
you might spend
three, four hours

752
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,838
driving to it,
and longer sometimes.

753
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,773
- It usually turns
into a 16-hour day.

754
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,007
- Yeah.

755
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:37,644
- Travel is the hardest thing
'cause

756
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:39,713
not only are you
a full time musician,

757
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,048
but you're always,

758
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,183
you're also just like
a full time truck driver.

759
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,918
?

760
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,062
- One of Wisconsin's
great polka players

761
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:56,964
is Steve Meisner
from Whitewater.

762
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,866
At the age of five,

763
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,735
his extraordinary
polka journey began

764
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:04,738
with a discovery
in his grandmother's house.

765
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:07,241
- Her attic was
always full of stuff.

766
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:10,177
My brother and I
came across a 12-bass accordion.

767
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,545
And I said to grandma,

768
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,947
"Do you think my dad would
teach me how to play this?"

769
00:35:14,014 --> 00:35:16,450
And she said, "Well,
when he comes to pick you up,

770
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:17,551
we'll ask him."

771
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:18,986
And he gets there,
picks us up

772
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,655
and I said, "Dad, will you teach
me how to play this accordion?"

773
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:25,626
And he said, "Sure, if you
promise never to quit."

774
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,361
So that's it.

775
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,029
- So you never quit?

776
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:30,330
- I never quit.

777
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,799
- You started playing
when you were five.

778
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:35,802
When did you step foot on stage
and start playing?

779
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,337
- When I was six.

780
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,939
- Oh! So, very very soon.

781
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,908
- My goal when I was a kid

782
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,176
was to play with my dad.

783
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:45,179
So that's all
I really wanted to do.

784
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:51,852
- Hey, how about a little
father and son duet here?

785
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,587
?

786
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,228
- Steve's dad
was the great Verne Meisner.

787
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:04,865
Hailed by the New York Times as
"one of the titans of polka,"

788
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:08,669
Verne began his career playing
in local bars at the age of 11.

789
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:11,538
- ? Oh my
She's making eyes at me

790
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,607
? Yeah

791
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,008
- He was a full time musician

792
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:16,577
his entire life,

793
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,213
a well-known bandleader
around the country.

794
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,915
You could walk into any tavern

795
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,384
and the jukebox
would have Verne Meisner on it.

796
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,587
- ? She wants to marry me

797
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,356
? And be my honey babe

798
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:32,326
- Verne and Steve Meisner

799
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:35,162
primarily play
Slovenian style polka,

800
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:37,231
a style that features
the accordion.

801
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,966
?

802
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,206
- Slovenian style
has always been

803
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,910
kind of the jazz side
of polka music.

804
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,945
Most Slovenian-style bands,

805
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:53,580
they know
how the melody's going,

806
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:54,915
doesn't necessarily mean
we're gonna play

807
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,551
those exact notes tonight.

808
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,587
They're just feeling it
and playing it.

809
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:03,090
- Okay, has everybody got
their dancing shoes on?

810
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:04,625
Let me look around out there.

811
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:05,859
Okay, a one, and a two.

812
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:07,227
Polka time!

813
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,962
?

814
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:17,337
- Steve's dream of playing
with his dad would come true.

815
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,209
In 1984, father and son

816
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,645
release the album <i>Meisner Magic</i> .

817
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:26,813
- That was so close to me,

818
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,851
because it was the first one I
got to play second accordion on.

819
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,387
I wrote some songs,
he wrote some songs.

820
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,056
And from that point on,
every album after that

821
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:40,127
I helped produce
and make all of his albums.

822
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,564
- Steve continued recording
and performing with his dad,

823
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,731
but he would go on

824
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:49,269
to establish himself
as an accordion virtuoso.

825
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:01,181
- His piano accordion playing
is amazing.

826
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:05,285
He's able to do the bass part
and totally counter melodies.

827
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:08,722
So he might be making
this fantastic run going up,

828
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,225
while his bass side
with his left hand

829
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,626
is coming down, doing a run.

830
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:14,461
It's like,
"That's mind blowing."

831
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,196
?

832
00:38:18,098 --> 00:38:20,267
- Steve gives all the credit
to his dad.

833
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:23,437
He never stopped learning
from the master.

834
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,639
- Just listening to his music

835
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:27,774
or just watching him,

836
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:29,710
he was the best teacher
I could ever have.

837
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:32,012
Even when he wasn't teaching me,
he was teaching me.

838
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,747
Kickin' his feet

839
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:36,383
or jumpin' around.

840
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,086
He would just light up the stage
when he played.

841
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,188
- Are y'all havin' a good time?

842
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,923
- Yeah!

843
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:48,862
- Verne Meisner passed away
in 2005 at the age of 66.

844
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:52,566
He's been inducted into
several polka Halls of Fame.

845
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:56,537
But perhaps Verne's biggest
legacy is what he gave his son.

846
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:58,772
? We don't want to go home

847
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,308
? We're having too much fun

848
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:02,943
? Yes we are

849
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,912
? We don't want to go home

850
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:07,381
? We don't want to go home

851
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:08,982
- To me there's only one guy.

852
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:10,450
It was Verne Meisner.

853
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:14,454
He truly was, from day one,
my inspiration.

854
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,423
- ? We don't want to go home

855
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,959
? We're having too much fun

856
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,262
- [cheers and applause]

857
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,997
- Hey!

858
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:29,203
- Polka music is
the soundtrack of Wisconsin.

859
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,938
?

860
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:37,611
And it turns up in all sorts
of places in our state.

861
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:40,347
Festivals, bars, weddings,

862
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,985
and even sporting events
like Badger football games.

863
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,787
[crowd cheers excitedly]

864
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:49,990
[band plays
"You've Said It All"]

865
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,826
?

866
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:01,668
- [crowd sings]
? When you say WIS-CON-SIN

867
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,036
? You've said it all

868
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:05,038
[band plays final notes]

869
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:08,876
But one of the most unusual
places you'll find polka...

870
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:11,111
- Welcome to
our polka worship service.

871
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:12,980
It is wonderful to be here.

872
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:14,715
- ...is at church.

873
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:17,484
- We're gonna use a few
of our band instruments

874
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:19,486
that we have here today.

875
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,855
- This is an ecumenical
polka church service.

876
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:24,925
It's based on a Roman Catholic
tradition in the Midwest,

877
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:28,395
dating back to the 1970s,
called a Polka Mass.

878
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:29,863
It's like other church services,

879
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,600
but instead of an organ
or choir, there's a polka band.

880
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:35,335
- ["Chapel in the Valley"]

881
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:37,070
? Oh La! Oh Lee Oh!

882
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:42,109
? Please take our troubles
for today

883
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:45,145
- The band plays religious songs

884
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:46,346
but with a polka beat.

885
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,081
?

886
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:54,988
- People don't dance
at a Polka Mass.

887
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:57,257
They sing along to the music,
as usual.

888
00:40:57,324 --> 00:41:01,461
- ? Great things happen
when God mixed with us

889
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:05,399
- A Polka Mass is commonly held
on Sunday mornings

890
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,201
at festivals like this one:

891
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:12,072
the Wisconsin State
Polka Festival in Oconomowoc.

892
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:15,075
Another place
you can attend a Polka Mass

893
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,144
is at a church picnic.

894
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,713
And one small town
in Wisconsin

895
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,015
throws a mighty big one.

896
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:26,019
Church picnics featuring
polka music are a summer staple

897
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:27,621
in communities across Wisconsin.

898
00:41:27,688 --> 00:41:31,458
But the one in Bevent
has become an <i>event</i> .

899
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:34,194
[indistinct conversation]

900
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:36,363
- Bevent is
a small Polish community

901
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,233
about 20 miles north
of Stevens Point.

902
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:40,434
It's here

903
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,636
that Saint Ladislaus
Catholic Church

904
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,705
puts on a very popular picnic.

905
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:45,906
They've named it

906
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,774
"Event in Bevent."

907
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,844
- The main objective is
a fundraiser for the parish.

908
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:54,248
And it's a way of getting people
to come together.

909
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:56,750
The work it takes
to put something like this on

910
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,185
is unbelievable.

911
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:02,389
- The chicken dinner served at
Event in Bevent is very popular.

912
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,825
Bevent native Adeline Domask

913
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:08,028
oversees preparation
of all the food.

914
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,062
- Chicken and ham.

915
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:10,597
Sauerkraut and sausage.

916
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,000
Chicken soup
with the homemade noodles.

917
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:14,568
Potatoes, gravy, stuffing,

918
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:17,204
and about 300 pies, we make.

919
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,673
Everything homemade.

920
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,675
You better eat fast.
[laughing]

921
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:23,744
- The food is served by

922
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:27,147
a small army
of bustling volunteers.

923
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:30,217
The most experienced among them
is Mattie Wanta.

924
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:31,952
- Cutting the bars.

925
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:34,454
Cakes and bars
and all that stuff.

926
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:37,057
- Mattie's been a church
volunteer for a long time.

927
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:38,792
- Uh, 72 years.

928
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:42,663
- She's lived in Bevent
all of her 96 years,

929
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,731
and fondly remembers
dancing the polka

930
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:46,533
with anyone she could find.

931
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,169
- My sister and partners
and boys and whoever.

932
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,972
- You did not dance with boys!

933
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,040
- Yes I did.

934
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:54,641
- And Mattie's
favorite kind of music

935
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,677
probably won't surprise you.

936
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,545
- Polka!

937
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:00,280
?

938
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:07,688
- Of course, polka is
the big draw at Event in Bevent.

939
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,423
?

940
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:16,163
- Bevent's church picnic
attracts

941
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,600
a large and enthusiastic
dance crowd every summer.

942
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,134
This year, that includes

943
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:26,006
the extraordinary couple,
Ashley and Randy Thull.

944
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:29,743
They're award-winning dancers

945
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,714
who teach people
across the country how to polka.

946
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,617
They start with
the basic polka step.

947
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:38,418
- We teach a six-step pattern.

948
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,653
- Okay.

949
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,788
- And if you're the lead,

950
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:43,123
you'd start with your left foot.

951
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,192
If you're the follow, you'd
start with your right foot.

952
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:47,928
And it's pretty much
left-right-left,

953
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,396
right-left-right.

954
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,165
You just keep doing that
six-step pattern over and over.

955
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:54,735
And eventually things happen.

956
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,470
?

957
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,240
? Yee-whoo

958
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,615
We just like to go out
and have fun,

959
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:11,418
like everybody else is
on the dance floor.

960
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:12,653
- The primary difference

961
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,723
is we do try to add
a little ballroom and swing

962
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,692
and some other dances.

963
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,928
- Whether it's polka or salsa

964
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,563
or any of the other
ballroom forms,

965
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:26,166
a lot of the stuff
just kind of intertwines,

966
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:28,569
and it's easy
to put into the polka.

967
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:30,304
?

968
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,155
[Ashley laughs]

969
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:50,090
- You two are fabulous dancers.

970
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:51,825
Do you find that people

971
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,994
are embarrassed to go out
and try dancing,

972
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,431
or don't feel it's welcome to go
out there if they're a beginner?

973
00:44:57,497 --> 00:44:59,433
- I don't think
polka's like that.

974
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:01,101
I just really want to see

975
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,103
people go out
and have a good time.

976
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,405
? It's enough
to set my feet a-dancing

977
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:06,707
? Dancing

978
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:09,343
? Dancing all the night away

979
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,613
- Even if you don't know
how to dance a polka,

980
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:15,482
you can get out there
and bounce around and have fun.

981
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:18,318
I mean, really,
no one's gonna to criticize you.

982
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,486
- It's true.

983
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,888
If you look around
the dance floor,

984
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:23,824
everybody's smiling
and having a good time.

985
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,559
?

986
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:30,664
- John and Lynn
certainly have a good time.

987
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:33,500
They've both worked tirelessly
to promote polka

988
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,068
throughout their lives.

989
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:38,338
And what better way to promote
it than with dancing?

990
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,140
- I met her
at a dance hall.

991
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:42,142
She was there one night.
I was there.

992
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:43,477
We danced.

993
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:45,379
I said, "Wow,
we do a good job together!"

994
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,114
So, here we are.

995
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:52,219
- John and Lynn
have won many dance contests,

996
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:56,857
often placing higher
than much younger couples.

997
00:45:57,124 --> 00:46:00,527
- A lot of the routines
that we do in polka,

998
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:03,197
we can incorporate in
other forms of dancing

999
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,332
like swing, South American.

1000
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:07,067
We do them all.

1001
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:10,070
- I've loved it from little on.

1002
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:13,841
I truly think I came out
of the womb dancing the polka.

1003
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:15,576
?

1004
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:22,783
- She's 80
and I'm older than her.

1005
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,151
- Much older.

1006
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:27,120
Much older.
- Eighty and a half.

1007
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,658
- We just, we have a good time.

1008
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:34,428
- John and Lynn may not be
typical dancers.

1009
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:38,332
But they're in the most common
age group that likes to polka.

1010
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:40,400
- One, two.
Check one, two.

1011
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,735
Testing one, two.

1012
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,470
Check one, two.

1013
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:45,105
- For a regular dance,

1014
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:48,108
it's basically an older crowd.

1015
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:49,476
But some of them are out there,

1016
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:51,612
they walk in the door with
a cane or whatever sometimes.

1017
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:52,813
And as soon as

1018
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,448
you start playing,
the canes are gone

1019
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:55,549
and they're out there dancing,

1020
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,950
and you're thinking
"How does this happen?"

1021
00:46:57,017 --> 00:46:59,853
- [counting out beat in German]
Eins, zwei, drei, vier.

1022
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,588
?

1023
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,397
- The doctor said to my wife,

1024
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:11,598
"What do you guys
do for exercise?

1025
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:14,134
You should really do
an exercise program."

1026
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:15,302
Well, we polka.

1027
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,737
"Oh, that's it!

1028
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:18,338
Don't worry about exercising."

1029
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:20,574
So, polka definitely
keeps you young.

1030
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:24,311
- It keeps us alive [laughs]
and moving!

1031
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:26,046
?

1032
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:31,051
- I just tuned 82.

1033
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,521
- I'll be 79 next week.

1034
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:37,057
- We really have a good time.

1035
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,325
- It's wonderful, we love it.

1036
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:40,060
?

1037
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,733
- One of the things about
a real dancing crowd is

1038
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,272
that the couples are on the
floor almost the whole evening.

1039
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,344
- It's kind of unreal.

1040
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:58,712
If you stick around here,
you'd see

1041
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:01,548
that some of the same people
dancing, like, eight hours.

1042
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:03,483
I mean it's like
they're about on the floor

1043
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,687
about every time
there's music going on!

1044
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:08,655
- They just have fun.

1045
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,624
?

1046
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:16,563
- Polka has played matchmaker

1047
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,198
for a lot of the couples you see

1048
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:20,601
on a typical dance floor.

1049
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:22,870
- We met at a polka dance.

1050
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:24,471
- We'd go to
all the local festivals

1051
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:26,073
and we'd meet up
once in a while,

1052
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,241
and just stayed in contact.

1053
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:29,309
- I'd send him an email,
"When's the next dance?

1054
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,745
Is your dance card open
so I could have a dance?"

1055
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:33,881
And he said,
"It's pretty full."

1056
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:36,316
Because why did you
start dancing, dear?

1057
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,185
- Oh, for the women.

1058
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,388
?

1059
00:48:43,657 --> 00:48:46,760
- I do a slide polka
and she was nuts about it.

1060
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:49,096
- I love to do the slide polka.

1061
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:50,564
- And we really go.

1062
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:54,201
We kind of do <i>that</i>
while we're dancing.

1063
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:59,139
And go like... Hell?
[laughs sheepishly]

1064
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:00,574
Makes us feel good.

1065
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,009
We care for each other.

1066
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,511
- We love it!
- Yeah, it's great.

1067
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:05,679
?

1068
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:08,849
- My wife and I
danced every week,

1069
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,584
for 60 years.

1070
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:14,388
Every dance hall
around this area

1071
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,456
that had polka music.

1072
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:20,794
- Herman Pfund met his wife,
Kathleen, in 1939.

1073
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:24,731
They were married for 65 years
before she passed away.

1074
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:27,634
Herman is now 95
and will never forget

1075
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,136
finding Kathleen.

1076
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:31,305
- I met her in New Glarus here

1077
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:34,842
at the-- used to be--
the Wilhelm Tell Hotel.

1078
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:38,545
Her and her girlfriend
were at a dance,

1079
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:40,514
and I knew her girlfriend.

1080
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:42,716
She introduced me to my wife
and after that...

1081
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:44,518
Whoa!
That was it.

1082
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:48,021
- Did you dance the polka
the first time you met?

1083
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,690
- Oh, you bet we did!

1084
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:52,226
And ever since after that.

1085
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,998
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1086
00:49:58,065 --> 00:49:59,533
- You guys know how to polka?

1087
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,801
- I know how to polka.

1088
00:50:00,868 --> 00:50:02,870
- Perfect!
We wanna see you out there.

1089
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:05,839
- Polka is also a way
we celebrate love.

1090
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:07,741
- Just take that moment in.

1091
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:09,376
Hold it right there.

1092
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,111
Beautiful.

1093
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:14,648
- We've been going out
to Madison, Wisconsin.

1094
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:15,883
The Essen Haus.

1095
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:17,551
That's actually the first time
we've polka-ed.

1096
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,753
And had never really
done it before.

1097
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,922
But when we went out there,

1098
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,824
everyone was out there dancing

1099
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:25,425
and we just had a great time.

1100
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,461
- Hey, you look beautiful.

1101
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:31,331
- Both of our families had polka
at their wedding, our parents.

1102
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:33,500
Like, it's super fun.

1103
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:34,935
- Well, Melinda and Justin,

1104
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:36,970
congratulations to you both.

1105
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,906
And thank you so much
for having us

1106
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:40,340
be a part of your special day.

1107
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:41,975
We really--
It is an honor for us.

1108
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,778
And, of course,
this is a celebration.

1109
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:46,180
And there's no better way
to celebrate

1110
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:48,248
than with good
old-fashioned

1111
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:49,983
polka music.

1112
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:52,219
- Whoo!
?

1113
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,100
- You know, years ago,

1114
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,203
all you had were polka bands
at weddings.

1115
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:10,938
And things have changed.

1116
00:51:11,004 --> 00:51:12,272
But every now and then,

1117
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,208
you'll still get a polka band
at a wedding

1118
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:17,211
because they know what a wedding
needs to really liven things up.

1119
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,946
?

1120
00:51:25,853 --> 00:51:27,521
- Hey, hey!

1121
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:30,057
- Hey!
Ho!

1122
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:33,160
- There's a high
Polish community and German,

1123
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:35,128
so it's great for this area.

1124
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:37,531
I think polka's perfect.

1125
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:43,237
- Polka is Wisconsin.

1126
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:44,972
- Hey! Whoo!

1127
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,909
- [cheers and applause]

1128
00:51:48,976 --> 00:51:52,312
- We're having fun now!
- [laughing]

1129
00:51:53,514 --> 00:51:55,182
?

1130
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:01,355
- Polka is a tradition
that bonds us together.

1131
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:05,325
For many,
it evokes our fondest memories.

1132
00:52:05,726 --> 00:52:07,194
- There's something
special about polka

1133
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:09,229
that makes it easy
to share with others.

1134
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,598
It connects us to our history,
to our state,

1135
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:14,668
and especially to our families.

1136
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,537
- It was such an important part

1137
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:18,071
of my grandparents' life.

1138
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,673
On Sunday afternoons,

1139
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,508
it was a big family dinner
at their place,

1140
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:23,210
and we would dance
in the dining room

1141
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:25,712
and dance in the living room.

1142
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,581
We have a family
Christmas Eve party

1143
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:30,184
that's been going on
for 70 years.

1144
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,752
And I had a great uncle,

1145
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:34,087
he played Christmas carols
playing accordion.

1146
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:39,059
So that's a huge part of who
I am and where we come from.

1147
00:52:40,627 --> 00:52:42,229
- My mom will be 90 this year

1148
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:44,264
and we were standing
right over here last year.

1149
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,133
And she hasn't danced
in a while.

1150
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,569
She's got bad hips
and all this and that.

1151
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:52,339
So she agreed to dance with me
off of the dance floor.

1152
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:55,776
And we spun around a few times
and we just had a great time.

1153
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,845
It was a great memory.

1154
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:02,482
- On his family's farm,

1155
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:05,285
Ralph Thull has always
tuned the radio to polka.

1156
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,856
His daughter Michelle
remembers one reason why.

1157
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:12,759
- My dad thinks the cows
milk better to polka music.

1158
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:15,362
- We always used to play it
in the barn all the time.

1159
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:17,297
- I remember in the parlor,

1160
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,366
he'd, of course,
have the polka music on.

1161
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:21,602
And sometimes
if there was hired help,

1162
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:23,437
they would come
and switch the station.

1163
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,905
And I remember my dad saying,

1164
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:27,140
"The cow's milk much better.

1165
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:28,342
"They're more well-behaved.

1166
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,676
"Everything just works better

1167
00:53:29,743 --> 00:53:32,713
if you just keep that dial
on polka music."

1168

- ? We're going to have

1170
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:40,420
? A polka celebration

1171
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,155
- Wherever I play,

1172
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:45,058
I see people
filled with happiness and joy.

1173
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:48,061
Polka really is
the music and dance

1174
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:49,329
of celebration.

1175
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,965
- We are all in it for the fun.

1176
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,336
And most people
don't like that much fun.

1177
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,305
But we're not most people.

1178
00:53:58,372 --> 00:54:00,307
- Everybody's smiling.

1179
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:01,975
Everybody's having a good time.

1180
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,845
It's just such a joy to be here.

1181

[whistles invitingly]

1183
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,884
- It's fun!

1184
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:13,053
How can you not have fun
with polka music?

1185
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,188
You hear it

1186
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:15,455
and you just want to dance,

1187
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:16,857
you want to
have a great time.

1188
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:19,126
It's a beautiful thing.

1189
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:21,461
- Lisa was selected to be
this year's Polka Queen

1190
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:23,697
by the Wisconsin Polka Boosters.

1191
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:27,768
They're dedicated to the
promotion the polka tradition.

1192
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:29,937
- They're looking
to bring out folks

1193
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:31,939
who also have an interest
and a love for music

1194
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:33,340
who haven't been
exposed to this.

1195
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:34,608
We talk about it.

1196
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,977
We share on Facebook
and social media

1197
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,512
events that we're going to.

1198
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,114
So we get to expose this awesome
music to a whole new generation.

? Dziewczynie po gebie

1204
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:54,428
- This is not exclusively

1205
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,930
a music for the retired.

1206
00:54:56,997 --> 00:54:58,899
It still is thriving today.

1207
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,834
There are new
and creative artists.

1208
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:03,103
There are wild young people,

1209
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,205
there are older
senior polka bands,

1210
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:06,940
and everything in between.

1211
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,343
- We'll all stay in polkas
for the rest of our lives.

1212
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:11,011
It's who we are,
it's in our blood.

1213
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:12,980
I can't really see
how it could ever die.

?

1215
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:17,451
- People have been saying
that it's going to die

1216
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:19,219
since the 50s
when it had its heyday,

1217
00:55:19,286 --> 00:55:20,954
but here we are

1218
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:24,157
and it's still going.
