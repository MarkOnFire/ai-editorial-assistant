00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,613
I also love the idea of giving,

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,048
and having someone else,
the viewer,

9
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,251
have an experience
from that art.

- My name is Andrew Linskens.

11
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,526
I am an artist working
out of Green Bay, Wisconsin.

[groovy bass music]

13
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,334
I think my style tends to be a
little bit more illustrative

14
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,870
than a lot of fine artists.

15
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,909
And I mostly work in acrylics,

16
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,011
whether that's on the side
of a large building

17
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,346
or whether it's on a canvas.

18
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,749
I want both to look equally
the same.

19
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:24,818
I work intuitively.

20
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,788
I mean, I really don't have
too much of a plan.

21
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:28,956
When I make a mark,

22
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,757
I like to make a mark
and move on.

23
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,160
I don't like to fiddle with it
and keep messing with it.

24
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,995
Once I make a mark or a gesture,

25
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:39,199
I wanna move on to the next mark
kind of thing.

[birds chirping]

27
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,448
I love the idea of flowers
and bees

28
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,650
because there's a
symbiotic relationship

29
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,818
that is happening there

30
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,686
with the fertilization
of the flowers

31
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:03,557
and how they're dependent
on each other.

32
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,628
There's a little bit
of a darker side

33
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,929
to the flower things too.

34
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,265
I did lose both of my parents.

35
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,634
Y'know, my father died
at a young age.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,736
I had a lot
of funeral experience.

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,004
We'll put it that way.

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,140
So the idea of flowers,
even the smell of flowers,

39
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,143
would always remind me of death,
to be honest with you.

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,347
So in a way, painting flowers
kind of gives me the ability

41
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,418
to kind of take control of that
a little bit.

42
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,893
And take that and make it
into something

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,062
that's a little bit different,
a little bit different memory

44
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,797
than that.

47
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:07,554
So the Art-Hop is a collective
of artists and musicians.

48
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,357
The three main components
of Art-Hop right now

49
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:14,361
are myself, Gregory Frederic,
and DJ RGS.

50
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:18,632
And we have been working for,
I think about eight years now,

51
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,269
y'know, bringing art
and music together.

52
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,071
So I've been working
with the Packers

53
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,639
for about seven years now.

54
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,641
And then now,
for the last three seasons,

55
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,610
we've been doing
every home game.

56
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,379
So we'll welcome, y'know,
the visiting team.

57
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,714
So let's say it's Chicago.

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,483
We'll say "Chicago," y'know,
"versus Green Bay," right?

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,253
And we'll allow the fans then
to approach that

60
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,587
with welcoming arms.

61
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,825
On game day, we arrive about
five hours before kickoff.

62
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,828
And then, we paint for
three hours prior to the game.

63
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,062
People love it.

64
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,098
I think it's something
very unique for Green Bay.

65

[camera shutters clicking]

66
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,682
What does art mean to me?

67
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,287
That's an interesting question.

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,891
Art is something that you can
speak without polarization.

69
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,860
Y'know, we live in this world

70
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:24,131
where whatever you say can be,
y'know, mistaken

71
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,666
and perhaps, y'know,

72
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,301
people can get the
wrong impression very quickly.

73
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,702
Or maybe they get
the right impression.

74
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,103
I don't know.

75
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,841
But street art is not, y'know,
considered graffiti anymore.

76
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,611
I think that allows the viewer
to approach art in a way,

77
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,513
give themselves that
little moment of pause

78
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,649
where they, y'know, have
a little moment of positivity

79
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,718
in their hectic day, you know?

80
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,119
And I think that's what it is.

81
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,321
I think art can really heal.

82
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,624
I think there's something
to that.
