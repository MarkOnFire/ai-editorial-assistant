00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:02,542
The history
of La Crosse

2
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:03,999
is forged
by the waterways

3
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,500
that traverse
Western Wisconsin.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,500
- Ellis Inman: You get out here
on the upper Mississippi River,

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,750
you've got
the towering bluffs

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,792
faced right up to the river
and all the wildlife.

7
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:18,417
- Ellis Inman
knows this river well.

8
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,250
- This is my dad,
Bo Inman.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,083
My father was captain
of the<i>Julia Belle</i>in the '90s.

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:23,917
[steam whistle warbles]

11
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,125
- The<i>Julia Belle Swain
</i> is a paddle-wheeled steamboat

12
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,750
that first cruised
the Illinois River in Peoria.

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,625
- Ellis: Everybody in Peoria
was really sad to see her go.
[steam whistle]

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:38,083
- The paddle-wheeler
arrived in La Crosse in 1995.

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,667
With its history
of steamboat building,

16
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,999
La Crosse would be
a perfect port

17
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,500
for this famous
queen of the river.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
[whistle blows,
paddle whisks]

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,333
- Ellis: It's pretty amazing.

20
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,999
It's been
in major motion pictures,

21
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,917
had albums and songs
written about it.

22
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,583
- This steamboat
is also

23
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,125
where Ellis felt at home
on the water.

24
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,999
- Ellis: I spent lots of time
on that boat as a child.

25
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,625
I might have been,
at one point in time,

26
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,875
the only kid

27
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,625
on the Mississippi River
working on a steamboat.

28
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,166
[blowing off steam]

29
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,875
I like to joke that the<i>Julia
 Belle Swain</i>was my first love.

30
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:11,333
[steam whistle]

31
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,667
- But not even love
could save the<i>Julia Belle.</i>

32
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:19,041
- Definitely, it hurt
a lot of people.

33
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:23,208
- In 2008, her paddlewheel
churned upriver

34
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,083
for the very last time.

35
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,500
- Ellis: It's hard to believe
how many people it's touched.

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,166
And that's exactly why
everybody was so disappointed

37
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,000
and why they were
so sad and hurt

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,208
by the fact
that the<i>Julia Belle</i>

39
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,208
shuttered
and was laid up.

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,750
- It remained dormant

41
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,417
until the<i>Julia Belle Swain
</i> Foundation

42
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,999
set out
to restore and preserve

43
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,250
this piece
of La Crosse history.

44
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,291
- Ellis: We're very lucky

45
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,041
that the<i>Julia Belle
</i>still even floats

46
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,999
after the last several years
of neglect.

47
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:54,542
Anything that's built
to move and built to run

48
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,291
gets destroyed
by just sitting.

49
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,417
- Then, just like
the muddy Mississippi River,

50
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:02,041
those renovation plans
got muddied,

51
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,208
millions of dollars spent,

52
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,959
and mounting costs
sank the project.

53
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,750
- Ellis: It was a lot
for people to deal with;

54
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,917
it really was.

55
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,166
A foundation dissolving

56
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,583
and not being able
to finish the project.

57
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,500
[calliope music]
The sadness,
the fact that

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,999
you'll never get to
experience that again.

59
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,500
- But Old Man River
has a way of never giving up

60
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,999
and always
pushing forward.

61
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,291
- Ellis: The river brings
lots of people together

62
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,667
for lots of reasons.

63
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,709
[torch sparking]

64
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,709
I had not expected
to come back to Wisconsin

65
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:36,999
and work on the boat.

66
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,083
[circular saw buzzes]

67
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:38,999
- Angela: This time,

68
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,333
new owners would put Ellis
at the helm

69
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,834
of restoration efforts.

70
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,458
- I guess
I have never really felt

71
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,500
any excitement
quite like that...

72
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,834
stepping back
on the boat,

73
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,208
knowing that
we're breathing life

74
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,959
back into this project.

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,959
- It is also a chance
to revitalize

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,917
the historic riverboat
his dad once captained.

77
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:57,667
- I guess coming back,

78
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,125
I kind of feel like a kid again.
[chuckles]

79
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,792
I feel like
I'm where I should be.

80
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:05,333
- Ellis would not only
work on the<i>Julia Belle,</i>

81
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:09,999
but also the<i>Spirit of Peoria
</i> riverboat restoration.

82
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,125
- Ellis: I like to call 'em
stepsisters.

83
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,125
[tool buzzing]

84
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,875
Obviously, from Peoria,
Illinois,

85
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:19,583
the boat replaced the<i>Julia
 Belle Swain</i>back in the '80s.

86
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,166
[ratchet clicking]

87
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,417
Every day is exciting;
every day is something new.

88
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,999
- By this point,
the<i>Julia Belle</i>

89
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,041
hadn't rolled on the river
in 14 years.

90
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,208
- Just sitting
is bad for a boat.

91
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:35,166
It's killed some of the greatest
boats that we've ever had.

92
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,792
- Despite past attempts
at preservation,

93
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:41,999
years of standing idle
proved unkind to the steamboat.

94
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,875
- Ellis: Once she got here
and we got into the project,

95
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,333
we realized that

96
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,999
there were a lot of changes
that needed to be made.

97
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,999
We dove right in,
torn her apart.

98
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,999
- Torn apart
and put back together

99
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,125
with a few more
bells and whistles.

100
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,208
- Don't want
to pull any punches here.

101
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,166
She won't be
the same as she was.

102
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,667
Once we're finished with her,

103
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,166
she's going
to be very different.

104
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,999
At her core, at her heart,
she'll still be a steamboat.

105
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,083
- The one thing
that won't change:

106
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,792
her 110-year-old steam engines.

107
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,792
- Ellis: They've had more than
a million miles logged on them.

108
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm looking forward
to the steam engines

109
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,625
[key ring clinking]
jumping back into life.

110
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,750
The sounds, the sights,
the smells, it's all part of it.

111
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,458
It's going to be
a lot of fun.

112
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,999
It'll be
definitely an experience.

113
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,250
- For La Crosse,
it's more bittersweet.

114
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
- It was quite emotional.

115
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,166
- In December of 2023,

116
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,625
a barge escorted
the stepsisters downriver

117
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,834
as the city
bid farewell

118
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:41,959
to the riverboats.

119
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,959
- There's only
five Sternwell steamboats left.

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,999
The bigger picture
is that we're working on this

121
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,250
so that we can inspire

122
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,542
another generation
of steamboaters.

123
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,041
- Their makeover
will continue,

124
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,709
and eventually, both will have
a new riverfront home,

125
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,375
but not in La Crosse.

126
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,375
- When we get to Nashville,

127
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,417
we'll be a wedding destination
of the South.

128
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,792
It's already
a huge wedding destination,

129
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,417
but once
this boat's there,

130
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:12,291
we'll be offering
fully curated weddings.

131
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,417
[calliope]
She'll still be
America's finest example

132
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,999
of a Sternwell steamboat,
in my opinion.

133
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,000
- As for Ellis,
he has no intention

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,834
of ever leaving
his first love.

135
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,625
I don't know that
I'll ever say goodbye again.

136
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,875
[cheerful calliope]

137
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,417
I'm looking forward
to a long future,

138
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,625
either
on the<i>Julia Belle</i>

139
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,208
or at least close enough
that I can hear her whistle.

140
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,333
[whistle blowing triumphantly,
Ellis laughs]

141
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,625
[cheers and applause]
