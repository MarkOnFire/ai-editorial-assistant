- Eva Marie Restel: The
La Crosse Symphony Orchestra

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:10,611
was founded in 1898,
had its very first concert

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,346
on March 4 of 1898.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,350
It started
as a community symphony.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,419
Somebody said, "Hey, you know,
I can conduct."

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,488
And they grabbed the musicians
in town.

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,458
And then, back in 1970s, 1980s,

9
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,264
then we started
paying our musicians,

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,600
and that's when you become a
regional, professional symphony.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,271
And the big change came with
when Alexander came in 2010.

12
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:41,074
He really attracted a lot of
musicians at a higher level,

13
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,911
and it elevated
what we were able to do.

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,314
So my job is everything outside
of what happens on that stage.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,384
Alexander is amazing
and does his art.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,688
So, all I have to do
is make people aware of that

17
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,691
and then create the experience
around it.

18
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:00,360
And we have completely changed

19
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,096
how it is to experience
the symphony.

20
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,132
The evening is now
a very full evening.

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,800
It starts at 6:30.

22
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,036
You've got live music
in the lobby

23
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:12,639
with cabaret tables
and little lights.

24
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,475
And the bars are open
and the background music

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,478
and there's all these things
going on.

26
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,548
So it makes for a fun,
full night.

27
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:27,588
It's extremely unusual to find a
professional regional symphony

28
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,558
in a town the size
of La Crosse, Wisconsin,

29
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,560
because it's expensive to do.

30
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,830
And the only way to do it is
through all of our partnerships

31
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:41,835
that we have with community
members and companies.

32
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,671
And because of all those
partnerships,

33
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,673
we are able to exist.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,309
[gentle orchestral music]

35
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:52,946
This community embraces
the symphony

36
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,450
as a critical part
of our overall community.

37
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,453
I would say that's true
about the arts in general,

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,456
that our community is just
really appreciative

39
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,125
of the arts that are provided.

40
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,295
It creates a culture
that they enjoy living in,

41
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:14,134
and they take it upon themselves
to be sure that that continues.

42
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:18,138
There's something special
about this community,

43
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:22,676
and you can feel that
when you go to the Symphony.
