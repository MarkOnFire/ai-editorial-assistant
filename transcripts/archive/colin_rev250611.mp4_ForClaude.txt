00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,466
Hi, my name is Colin Crowley

2
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:01,933
and I am a

3
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,866
multimedia field producer

4
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:05,500
for PBS Wisconsin.

5
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,966
I think there's a lot of crossover

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,333
between, let's say,

7
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:12,333
filmmaking and making music, because

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,600
in filmmaking and making television,

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,066
you're focused on rhythm,

10
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,633
you're focused on mood.

11
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:20,866
And so when we come in and film artists,

12
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,100
we're really trying to get

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,500
we're trying

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,666
to bring people inside the music.

15
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,133
So actually a lot of the people on

16
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,000
these crews are musicians themselves.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,366
So we're getting a feel for

18
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,866
when is this chorus going to hit,

19
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:32,933
when is this vocalist

20
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:33,800
going to do something?

21
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,566
And we're trying to

22
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:36,600
contribute to that

23
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,433
with the way we film it with the movement

24
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,366
and we incorporate it

25
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,666
and incorporate to it.

26
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,066
And then also when we do the edit,

27
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,766
there's a lot of musicality and rhythm

28
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,433
to the way we edit our pieces.

29
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,066
So this is a

30
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,266
beautiful collaboration

31
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:49,933
for us to work

32
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,500
with all these talented artists

33
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,366
and for us to bring our kind

34
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:54,433
of musical sense

35
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,600
to the way we film their performances.

36
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,933
for me,

37
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,700
the most important resource

38
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,366
we have at PBS Wisconsin is our people.

39
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,133
And one of the things I love

40
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,500
about PBS Wisconsin,

41
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,700
and that's all coming together

42
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,000
in this project, is we work

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,166
with the best people,

44
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,033
everybody we work with.

45
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:12,766
Not only are

46
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:14,600
they talented at what they do,

47
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,900
skilled at what they do,

48
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,733
technically skilled,

49
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,633
they're all just amazing human beings.

50
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,733
We come from all over the country.

51
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,066
Some of us come from different countries

52
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,833
all together, and we've all come together

53
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,833
in Wisconsin at PBS Wisconsin

54
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,433
because we love what we do.

55
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,466
We love this state.

56
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,833
We love the people of this state,

57
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,633
and we love coming into communities

58
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,000
like Appleton

59
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,733
and showing

60
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,133
how everything comes together

61
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,733
and creates the culture that we all know

62
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,800
and love here in Wisconsin.
