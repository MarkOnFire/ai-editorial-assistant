a family serving up sweet treats

- Angela Fitzgerald: Hello,
and welcome to <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,044
I'm kicking back
at the Kickapoo Valley Reserve

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,579
to explore the area

29
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,149
and learn about their
dark sky conservation work.

30
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,984
That's right,
we're exploring

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,921
a potential future Dark Sky Park
in the day.

32
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,958
The reserve
is more than 8,000 acres

33
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,627
and sits between the Village
of Lafarge and Ontario,

34
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,163
in the heart
of the Driftless area.

00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,365
[plucky country rock]

36
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,935
The land is managed
in partnership

37
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,905
with the State of Wisconsin
and the Ho-Chunk Nation.

38
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,742
They work together to preserve,
protect, and educate visitors

39
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:54,047
about the rich resources
surrounding the Kickapoo River.

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,883
As the sun sets,

41
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,552
visitors can enjoy
the majestic night skies.

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,421
The area is working
to be designated

43
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,924
as the second International
Dark Sky Park in Wisconsin,

44
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,294
which requires maintaining
low levels of light pollution

45
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,696
to better see
the stars,

46
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,966
making one of the best spots
to stargaze in our state

47
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,701
even better.

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,937
We'll learn more
from the team

49
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,407
about their efforts
to keep the skies dark later on.

50
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,944
Now, let's head into
our first story.

00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,846
[shimmery music]

52
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,781
We drive
into New Richmond

53
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,284
as teens prepare
old school buses

54
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,686
for a smashing
good time.

55

[blues rock
with electric guitar]

56
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,066
It's been said
countless times

57
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,869
that the wheels on the bus
go round and round.

58
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,638
- Ellajanski:
It's kind of chaotic at first.

59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,942
- Angela:
But on a Saturday evening
in New Richmond, Wisconsin...

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,411
- Dominic Harker: You never know
what's about to happen.

61
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:02,716
- Angela: The wheels on these
buses go crash, bang, boom.

62
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,987
[rock music,
loud engines]

63
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,827
- Dominic Harker: It's kind of
just hold your foot to the floor

64
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,129
and pray
that everything goes right.

65
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,899
- Named Battle of the Buses,

66
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,768
this part-race,
part-demolition-derby

67
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,504
has become
an annual tradition

68
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,205
at Cedar Lake Speedway.

69
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,609
- Brad Both:
Only happens once a year and you
can only see it this one time.

70
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,776
So, it's really fun.

71
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,246
- Teams are given the task
of retrofitting

72
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,914
old, donated school buses

73

[aerosol spraying]

79
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,493
- And it's only fitting
that the people

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,062
these buses
were designed to transport

81
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,032
make up the crews
assigned with their destruction.

82
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,735
- Trace: There's a lot of people
working on this bus

83
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,505
and a lot of, like,
younger students.

84
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,740
- Angela: That's right.

85
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,544
Outside of the drivers,
the teams for each bus

86
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,513
are made up almost entirely
of high school students.

87
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,249
- Grant: That's pretty cool.

88
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,721
[electric guitar riffs,
pounding hammer]

89
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,291
- Brook Reyzer:
We strip it all out.

90
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,293
So, first things to come out
are all the seats,

91
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,196
all the windows,
the side paneling,

92
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,131
the roof,
the insulation.

93
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,700
- At St. Croix Central
High School,

94
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,002
the opportunity
to work on the buses

95
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,737
provides a chance
for some kids

96
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,307
to switch gears
and try something new.

97
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,175
- Peter Nusbaum:
They got to do some wiring.

98
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,376
They're working
on the engine.

99
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,878
They're doing
some tuning.

100
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,315
Probably be a stack
coming out of this hood

101
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,483
probably after this weekend,
or so.

[angle grinder howling]

103
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,887
- Ellajanski: I had never used
angle grinder before,

104
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,557
and I just got handed to it
and did it.

105
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,794
- About 40 miles north,
at Unity High School,

106
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,164
students are getting
their own bus ready.

107
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,566
- Jake Lee: As soon
as they see the bus is in,

108
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,368
they run to my room
pretty much and say,

109
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,769
"When are we
working on the bus?

110
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,438
When are we working on the bus?"
[whirring]

111
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,774
- The buses compete in three
races throughout the event.

112
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,944
The first two races
are all about speed.

113
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:16,016
[pulsing electric bass,
electric guitar, and drums]

114
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,188
- Jake Lee: It seems like
you're going a lot faster

115
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,356
than you actually are.

116
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,324
Going around a dirt track
around the corners,

117
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,759
it seems like
I'm gonna tip over.

118
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,362
But the kids, when they
talk to me afterwards,

119
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,430
they're like, "Why were
you going so slow, Mr. Lee?

120
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,299
You're only going
like 35."

121
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,168
I'm like, "No way,
I wasn't going 35.

122
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,003
I was going
a lot faster than that."

123
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,471
[bus slams into another bus]

124
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,072
- The third race
is all about strength.

125
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,643
- Jake Lee:
It's not fun if we're
just racing around a track.

126
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,778
Nobody wants to see
a bus race around a track.

127
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,513
They want to see us
smash into people,

128
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,415
tip over,
all that kind of stuff.

129
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,351
- Announcer: Over there,
turn three, whoa!
[crowd cheers]

130
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,387
- Dominic Harker: The definition
turns like a dump truck

131
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,255
is true
in this circumstance.

132
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,691
- Jake Lee: My strategy is,
I tell the kids,

133
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,028
I don't want this bus to be
running by the end of the race.

134

[adrenaline-filled

135
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,801
- For these students,

136
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,103
when it comes
to high school milestones,

137
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,872
there's Battle
of the Buses,

138
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,209
and everything else
is a distant second.

139
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,478
- Jake Lee:
One year, we had the prom
the same night as the bus race,

140
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,415
and so a lot of the kids
were upset about that

141
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,250
and had to make
this big choice on,

142
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,985
"Am I gonna go
to the prom

143
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,787
or am I gonna go
to the bus race?"

144
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,090
There were several dates
that were a little upset

145
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,327
that they chose the bus race
over the prom, so...

146
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,928
- Angela: And like prom,

147
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,064
race night
promises to be a night

148
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,032
they'll likely
never forget.

[punchy snare drum]

150
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,738
- Brook Reyzer:
Most of the time,
I'm not even watching the track,

151
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,406
but I'm watching
these kids

152
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,742
and I'm watching
their families' faces.

153
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,143
I'm watching the littles,
you know,

154
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,679
look at
these high school kids

155
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,248
and dream about
doing this someday.

Brook Reyzer:
The whole full cycle
is something you can't describe.

[shimmery music]

165
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,969
- Next up,
we navigate
to Manitowoc

166
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,604
to meet a veteran
who went from

167
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,907
serving soldiers
in a sub

168
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,442
to serving them
in his pub.

169
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,779
[seagulls squawking]

170
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,348
At the Wisconsin Maritime
Museum in Manitowoc,

171
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,518
a tour of
its World War II submarine

172
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,587
is a peak experience.

173
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,291
- Kevin Cullen: An engineering
marvel, diesel and electric.

174
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,825
- Painstakingly restored,

175
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,028
the sub looks and feels

176
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,830
much as it would have
when on patrol

177
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,033
in the war-torn waters
of the Pacific.

178
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,235
For the museum's
executive director,

179
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,737
the ship
represents many things.

180
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,340
- Kevin Cullen: Behind me here
is <i>USS Cobia,</i>

181
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,942
a national landmark

182
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,376
from World War II.

183
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,379
It's a testament
to the service and sacrifice

184
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,548
that the submariners
endured.

185
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,483
And, of course, the legacy
of building submarines

186
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,918
in Manitowoc.

187
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,120
Twenty-eight subs
launched here

188
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,591
and <i>Cobia</i> kind of has
a sentinel of that heritage.

189
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,795
- For Manitowoc native
and Navy veteran, Jeff Tess,

190
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,831
boarding the <i>Cobia</i>
means something else.

191
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,900
- Jeff Tess: This is home.

192
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,435
This is where
I felt comfortable.

193
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:26,139
Life on a submarine
is the most peaceful existence

194
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,708
you've ever had
in your life.

195
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:31,011
American submarines
are the best,

196
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,780
so you don't worry
about much.

197
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,617
Do your job, and you don't
worry about anything else.

198
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,520
- The <i>Cobia</i> was already
a museum piece

199
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,290
by the time Jeff joined
the US Navy's submarine service.

200
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,326
But for him,
it's not so different

201
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,897
from the advanced nuclear
submarine he called home.

202
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,598
- Oh, yeah,
not much different.

203
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,967
I was a cook;
that was my job.

204
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,335
We have
our coffee machine here.

205
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,837
We have
a flat-top griddle.

206
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,138
We have an oven.

207
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,374
- The job
was a vital one.

208
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,876
- If you can't cook
or you're not good,

209
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:03,944
you don't last
very long.

210
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:04,978
And that's
a true statement.

211
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,380
I believe
that the cooks

212
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,582
are the most important person
on the boat

213
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,518
because there's nothing else
to take your mind off of life

214
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,653
except the food.

215
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,488
[food sizzling]

216
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,557
[utensils clinking]

217
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,894
- Jeff Tess: Food is something
that brings the world together.

218
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,730
So, on a submarine,
that's the same thing.

219
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,400
It's the one time
where the crew gets together,

220
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,203
shares a meal,
talks, laughs, has fun.

221
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,637
You made cookies
or sticky buns.

222
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,606
You've made those,
you had a lot of friends.

223
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,609
- Jeff is still
making friends

224
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,579
and bringing people together
around food.

225
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,248
- Jeff: What can I do to you?
[laughing]

226
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,316
- In Two Rivers,

227
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,751
just up the road
from the <i>USS Cobia,</i>

228
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,721
overlooking the open waters
of Lake Michigan,

229
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:51,592
Jeff opened
Submariner's Pub in 2022.

230
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,295
- Jeff: My job is to serve
good food and nice cold beers

231
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,865
so that everybody
can enjoy themselves.

232
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,867
- Just like his job
in the Navy,

233
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,870
Jeff's work
serves a higher purpose.

234
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,507
Here, he honors
the service of others.

235
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,909
- Jeff: This is my homage
to the veterans that

236
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:12,713
provide the safety and security
and the freedom we have.

237
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,382
- Like the cramped confines
of a submarine,

238
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,286
every nook and cranny
of the pub serves its purpose.

239
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,789
- Jeff: There's hats, there's
a bunch of memorabilia around,

240
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,058
and there's pictures
on the wall.

241
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,196
I have 12 pictures of my family
up there that all served.

242
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,698
I have an Uncle Gordy
who jumped in on D-Day,

243
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:35,035
his Purple Heart and
his Bronze Star are over there.

244
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,905
And anybody can bring a
family member, themselves,

245
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,872
whatever in.

246
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,374
I call it
my Hero Wall.

247
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,944
It's a tribute to
the people that made us great.

248
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:47,614
- Those tributes are
not just for the distant past.

249
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,284
Submariner's Pub
has quickly become

250
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,120
a second home
for area veterans.

251
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:56,557
One vet with her picture
on the wall is Ashley Smits,

252
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:00,060
head of the organization
Manitowoc County Vets.

253
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,863
- Ashley Smits:
A lot of veterans, when
they get out of the military,

254
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,631
they feel isolated,
they feel alone.

255
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,602
To have Submariner's Pub
is a place that you can connect

256
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,572
that just brings
that camaraderie together,

257
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,906
and a place where you can

258
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,243
feel understood
and seen and heard again.

259
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,679
- One of the things
that I was missing as a veteran

260
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,881
was a place
to come talk to people

261
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,751
that are like-minded
and get through it.

262
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,022
- Where Jeff cooks today

263
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,026
is laid out almost exactly
like the submarine's galley,

264
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,696
and the satisfaction he takes
is the same.

265
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,531
- Jeff: It's a part of my heart.

266
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:40,367
When I cook your meal,
and you eat it,

267
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,069
and I see the smile
on your face,

268
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,705
and you're telling me
how good it was,

269
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,340
it's what I need
for my feedback.

270
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,876
Your smile
makes me happy.

271
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,212
Feeding the world
is a cool thing,

272
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,282
and making people happy,
there's nothing better.

273
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,352
There's really
nothing better.

274
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,454
[shimmery music]

275
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,589
- I'm at
the Kickapoo Valley Reserve,

276
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,191
learning about
The Driftless Area

277
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:08,262
and what it takes to become
a designated Dark Sky Park.

278
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,131
[uplifting acoustic guitar]

279
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,567
My first stop
was to the Nature Center

280
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:19,239
to meet with Executive Director
at the Reserve, Jason Leis.

281
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,842
- Jason Leis:
The Kickapoo Valley Reserve

282
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,678
is an 8,600-acre tract
of public land

283
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,415
that offers a multitude
of recreational activities.

284
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,552
We have over 50 miles
of trails here.

285
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,821
Horseback riding,
hiking, biking...

286
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,157
Bird watching
is very popular, as well,

287
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,892
and, of course,
we have the Kickapoo River

288
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,528
that runs right through
the middle of the property,

289
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,265
which is very popular for
canoeing and kayaking, as well.

290
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,567
- And what's unique
or special

291
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,468
about the ecology
of the reserve?

292
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,338
- The reserve is located
in the Driftless area,

293
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,307
so untouched by glaciers
mostly.

294
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,476
What is kind of unique
about this area

295
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,812
is the sandstone cliffs
and outcroppings,

296
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,083
and a lot of those
are best seen along the river.

297
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,484
[birds chirping]

298
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,788
- Up in the sky, visitors can
enjoy spectacular stargazing

299
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,791
as the Kickapoo
Valley Reserve

300
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,961
works to become
a designated Dark Sky Park.

301
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,330
One of the leaders
of that effort

302
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,232
is Scott Lind.

303
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,033
- Scott Lind: Well,
the Kickapoo Valley Reserve

304
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,435
is located
in a part of Wisconsin

305
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,704
that still has
relatively dark skies

306
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,372
compared to
the rest of the state,

307
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,708
and so it's a natural place
to try and continue

308
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:28,842
to keep that area dark

309
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,777
and provide
a good space for stargazing,

310
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,713
'cause it's rare
in the state of Wisconsin now

311
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,715
to be able to see
as many stars at night

312
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,717
as you can see
in this part of the state.

313
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,219
- And so, in terms of trying
to minimize that pollution

314
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,523
to maintain the opportunity
to stargaze here,

315
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,424
what do those
conservation efforts look like?

316
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,426
- So, we do that right here
on the sites

317
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,828
that we're actually trying
to get designated.

318
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,096
But the next step then

319
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,298
is to try to do outreach
to the communities around us

320
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,934
to try and encourage
businesses and residences

321
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,770
to also do the same thing
with their fixtures,

322
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,773
because all those lights
around us,

323
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,109
as far away
as La Crosse even,

324
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,844
produce sky glow here.

325
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,012
- It's a great point.

326
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,413
It looks like
you have an example

327
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,814
of one of those
light fixtures here.

328
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,249
- I do, yeah.

329
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,051
There's something a lot of times
folks don't understand

330
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,053
is that when you get
a light fixture like this,

331
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,688
which is a full cutoff fixture,

332
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,157
what that means is
the fixture's entirely opaque,

333
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,660
except for the bottom surface
where the lens is right here.

334
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,161
That controls
the direction of the light.

335
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,663
So, what they often
don't understand

336
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,731
is when they see that
small opening at the bottom,

337
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,733
you might assume that
all the light goes right there.

338
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,502
This LED fixture right here
can throw light

339
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,205
at far distances away
in front of it, right?

340
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,973
That light is cast
out in front,

341
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,142
but none of it
goes above this line right here.

342
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,444
So, dark sky lighting gives
you lower electricity bills

343
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,246
for the same amount
of light on the ground,

344
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,981
and you have the benefits
to the habitat,

345
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,983
and you don't get
the sky glow.

346
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,053
- I love that that message
is expanding such a wide terrain

347
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,323
in terms of how
we collectively can do our part

348
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,525
to help maintain
what's needed

349
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,828
in order for folks
to enjoy the sky.

350
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,097
Angela:
With cutoff light fixtures

351

and a dedicated team
managing the land,

352
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,301
the Kickapoo Valley Reserve

353
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,004
works to keep this area
wild and dark.

[shimmery music]

356

Now, we head
to Tomahawk

357
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,882
to get the scoop
on a family keeping

358
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,085
a Northwoods
tradition
churning.

359

[strumming acoustic guitar]

360
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,792
This Dutch-style windmill

361
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,363
is an icon of pop culture
in the Northwoods.

362
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,332
- Pat Berg:
It is a landmark for sure.

363
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,303
The history of the building
is fantastic.

364
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,139
We hear
a lot of stories.

365
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:43,510
- Russell Berg: It was part of
Phil's Resort on Lake Nokomis.

366
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,612
The building goes back
to 1939,

367
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,082
and it was originally built
as a Sinclair gas station.

368
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,252
- Russell Berg
is the family historian.

369
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,621
- Russell: Over the years,
it's been a candy shop.

370
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,690
There was
an information booth,

371
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,359
and sometime
in the mid to late 70s,

372
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,727
it became
an ice cream shop,

373
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,462
and it has been
ever since.

374
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,700
- The Berg family built its
own history with the Windmill

375
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,803
and can serve up stories
and ice cream

376
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,171
all in one scoop.

377
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,574
- Russell: In 1993,
my parents bought it,

378
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,842
Pat and Charlie Berg.

379
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,743
Mom was getting close
to retirement

380
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,346
as a fourth-grade teacher
down in Athens, Wisconsin.

381
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,282
- Pat Berg: And I said
going past here,

382
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,885
"Someday,
we're going to own this."

383
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:28,222
Never giving it
another thought at all.

384
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,224
Can I help you, sir?

385
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,626
[twangy country guitar]

386
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,833
Pat: When we bought it, I said,
"We're buying it for the kids

387
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,668
and for
the young at heart."

388
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,470
Oh, here comes the kids.

389
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,539
[fun, swinging jazz]

390
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,512
- Ice cream is what put this
tourist attraction on the map.

391
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,380
[bouncy jazz]

392
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,682
- Russ: We like to think
we're at the intersection

393
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:59,720
of Wisconsin's dairy industry
and tourism industry,

394
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,688
offering the best
of what

395
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,925
the state of Wisconsin
has to offer.

396
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,860
- Customer: Thank you so much.

397
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,329
- For more than 32 years,

398
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:14,134
the Bergs have hand-scooped,
served, and created smiles.

399
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,271
- Rodney Berg:
The biggest surprise for me was

400
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,773
just how happy
it makes people feel.

401
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,476
No one ever comes into
an ice cream shop crying.

402
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,645
- Pat: Hello, come on in.

403
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,180
Don't be shy.

404
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,316
And I love when
they come in as a family,

405
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,585
and all the kids are smiling

406
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,821
and looking already
what they're going to order.

407
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,723
- Child: I'm going to, ahh...
- Adult: Okay.

408
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,725
- Pat: Even the little babies,
I always say,

409
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,294
"Oh, Baby came for a treat."

410
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,062
- Russ Berg:
It's become a tradition.

411
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,899
People reminiscing to where
their grandparents brought 'em,

412
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:49,636
and now they're bringing
their kids or their grandkids.

413
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,805
[lively swing]
- Mother: All right, guys.

Smile!
- So fun!

415
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,177
- For several generations,

416
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:01,315
the Windmill has also become
a Berg family tradition.

417
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,618
- Rodney: Spending 30 years
working alongside my mom,

418
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:07,421
seeing how it grew
throughout all those years.

419
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,323
- Pat: Two scoops on that?

420
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,226
Chocolate on top,
hot fudge.

421
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,728
- Rodney: And then, as I got
married and had children,

422
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:18,699
when they got old enough, I was
working alongside them, too.

423
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,702
- Meagan Berg: I grew up here,
so it's a special place for me.

424
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,303
Meagan:
When I was really little,

425
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,439
I would come and help clean up
in the morning.

426
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:26,940
And then,
when I was old enough,

427
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,877
I started
scooping ice cream.

428
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,378
I got to hang out
with her

429
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,981
and I became super close
with her.

430

Just watching her
own her business

431

to just follow my dreams.

- Customer: I'm gonna get
a single scoop in a bowl.

433
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,791
- I have very good
grandchildren,

434
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,661
and they're very helpful,
and they're very good.

435
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,129
They learn fast.

100 flavors in rotation,

437
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,569
there's always
a favorite in store.

438

vanilla, chocolate, strawberry.

along with bubble gum

and cake and ice cream.

00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,585
Okay?
- Pat: Yep.

- Flavor after flavor,

the Windmill
made a name for itself.

[sentimental acoustic]

449
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,936
July 4th is
our Super Bowl week or weekend.

450
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,872
It's the biggest holiday
here in the Northwoods.

451
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:34,341
- Pat: Oh, we're gonna
need a new one.

452
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,577
- Russ: There are times
where we will go through

453
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,079
70 to 80 tubs of ice cream.

454

these people coming in on boats,

[boat blows horn]

00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,524
- Meagan: You get to see people,

459
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,059
you know,
connect with one another

460
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,328
and have a smile
on their face.

"Wow, this is fabulous!

that come

- I love the Windmill,
and I always did.

467
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,715
- Place... I have
so many memories here,
like countless. [laughs]

468
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,818
So, it's just
a special place for me.

469
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,053
A million funny stories.

470
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,223
- Charlie: It's kind of humbling
to have so many people come

471
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,793
and love and comment
on their experiences here.

472
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,130
The biggest compliment we
can get is when a family says,

473
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:31,398
"We'll be back tomorrow."

474

476

- For our
last story,

477
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,973
we joined storyteller
Takeyla Benton

478
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,742
on stage
in Madison

479
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,644
as she explores
motherhood

480
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,046
and all the emotions
that come with it

481
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,248
in this
animated tale.

482
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,486
[audience applauding]

483
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,126
- Takeyla Benton:
It's a rare thing

484
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:02,229
to get a glimpse of yourself
from the outside.

485
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,798
All of your
hard work, love, devotion,

486
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,701
the sacrifices
and sleepless nights

487
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,436
and think,

488
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:11,238
"I'm a pretty
freaking awesome mom."

489
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,106
[audience laughs]

490
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,909
Well, [whoosh] this is not
one of those times.

491
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,110
[laughter]

492
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,112
It's more like [whoosh]
one of those occasions

493
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,115
surrounded by half-folded
[whoosh, child's karate call]
baskets of clothes

494
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:23,884
and piles
of books and papers

495
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,887
screaming, "Will you kids
just leave each other alone?

496
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,255
"WHY?
Why, why, why

497
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:31,091
am I always
stepping on Legos?"

498
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:32,593
[audience laughs,
Takeyla sighs]

499
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,760
"That's it!
Go to bed.

500
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,295
Everybody, just go to bed!"

501
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,030
[laughter]

502
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,901
I forced a smile,
recalling that day.

503
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,670
"It was an overwhelming day,"
I said to my son.

504
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,472
"I was very sad."

505
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,442
"But you didn't cry,"
my little guy responded.

506
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,043
"Moms get mad a lot,

507
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,112
but they don't cry."

508
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,147
In that instance,
I realized

509
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,949
how my kids
must've saw me.

510
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,784
Have I failed
to show my kids

511
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:00,787
it's okay to display emotions
in a constructive way?

512
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:01,955
Hmm...

513
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:04,091
Surely, I've cried
in front of my kids, right?

514
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,492
[purses lips]

515
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,830
Well, when I was pregnant,
I remember crying <i>all the time.</i>

516
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:12,900
Those ASPCA commercials
get me every time.

517
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,968
[audience laughing]

518
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,404
But that was
late at night,

519
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,306
and I'm sure
my daughter was sleeping.

520
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:20,607
Maybe one
of the times

521
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,544
when the pain from my migraine
reached a fever pitch.

522
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,480
Probably not, since I prefer
to hide in the bathroom.

523
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,949
I tend to hide in the bathroom
a lot I think,

524
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,551
when that uncomfortable
emotional side of me

525
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,119
starts taking over.

526
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,620
Could that be why

527
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,889
my kids refuse to allow me
any privacy in the bathroom?

528
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:37,257
[click, door creeks opens]

529
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:40,394
Even if I'm on the toilet,
they feel it's okay to burst in,

530
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,628
mid-argument,

531
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,664
forcing me to mediate
from the porcelain throne.

532
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,134
[kids yelling,
audience laughs]

533
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,804
Locking the door
doesn't help either.

534
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,540
I see little, tiny fingers
underneath the door.

535
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,275
[laughter]

536
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,444
They slide notes
under there.

537
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:58,779
[laughter]

538
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,148
Hear my son screaming,
"Mom, Mom,

539
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,083
"I know you're not
using the bathroom.

540
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,585
"You have your phone.

541
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,320
"I can see it.

542
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,589
"Poo particles!

543
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,858
Poo particles are getting
all over your phone."

544
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:13,594
[Takeyla and audience
laughing]

545
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,564
They don't know
that I'm Googling affirmations

546
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,733
because everything
that I know how to do

547
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,702
is not working
anymore.

548
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,104
I'm replaying
the last 14 years of my life,

549
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,772
trying to figure out
what went wrong.

550
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,609
And perhaps if I had cried
more in front of their dad,

551
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,244
he wouldn't have been
so distant.

552
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,446
He has told me on many occasions
that he felt

553
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,616
I was only open when I was
crying, and my guard was down.

554
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,752
Yet the thought that
my kids have not seen me cry

555
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,621
bothers me deeply.

556
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:43,857
It bothers me as deeply
as the constant tears

557
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,826
that are ingrained
on my shoulders

558
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,494
that my mother
cried on.

559
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:48,695
I knew early on

560
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,697
I didn't wanna be emotional
like that.

561
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,500
I said, "I'd be a boulder
like my grandmother,

562
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,403
"who I only ever saw
shed a tear

563
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,606
for my father's
incarceration."

564
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,545
Even when I saw her
the last days of her life

565
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,248
laying in her hospital bed,
she looked at me and smiled,

566
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:11,451
and motioned for me to come
and sit next to her in the bed.

567
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:12,986
I couldn't.

568
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:14,388
I ran in the bathroom
and cried,

569
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,691
and I still regret that
to this day.

570
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,460
"Moms do cry,"
I told my son,

571
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,696
"Like when you leave your Legos
on the floor,

572
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:24,731
and I step on them."

573
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,002
"Or, especially, when your
sister uses up all the data,

574
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,672
yeah, I cry."
[audience laughing]

575
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:34,308
[speaking as son]
"No, no, you curse, Mom.

576
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:36,043
You don't cry."

577
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,848
Okay, note to self,
stop cursing, at least out loud.

578
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,050
[Takeyla and audience laughing]

579
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:45,419
Or perhaps the next time
I'm in the bathroom,

580
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,654
and one of them slides a note
under the door,

581
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,623
I'll write a reply back
that says,

582
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,325
"Mom is crying.

583
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,659
Do not disturb,"

584
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,561
and slide it
back out to them,

585
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:55,762
poo particles and all.

586
