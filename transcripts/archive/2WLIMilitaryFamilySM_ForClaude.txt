00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,904
[stately military music]

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,906
- Michael Hellquist: I knew
I wanted to be military

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,174
from a young age.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,177
I served
in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,645
- Angela Fitzgerald:
Michael Hellquist grew up

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:16,750
in a military family, along with
a sense of honor and tradition.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:21,989
- My grandfather is probably
my biggest inspiration.

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,957
How's it going, Gramps?

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,492
- George Swenson:
Just wonderful.

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,828
- Michael: It actually started
with the American Legion.

11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:32,099
I was a kid, and any time he'd
have a Legion meeting to go to,

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,434
a function, I'd go with.

13
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,669
- George: What?

14
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:36,870
- Michael: You're the
longest-serving legionnaire

15
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,606
in the state of Wisconsin.
- You're kidding.

16
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,475
I didn't know that.

17
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,844
[gavel banging]

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,380
- Angela: Grandfather
and grandson

19
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,918
still share time together at the
American Legion in Kenosha.

20
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,120
- Michael: So this is probably
one of my favorite pictures

21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,288
of my grandpa.

22
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,256
That was just
this past Army Navy game.

23
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,325
- Angela: Michael is on a
mission to piece together

24
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,261
his family's history
in the armed forces.

25
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,063
- Robert Hellquist: You know,
I got that hat.

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,465
- Yeah, I'd like to put it
on display at some point.

27
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,867
- Yeah.
- Angela: On this day,

28
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,369
he shares the collection
of military memorabilia

29
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,938
with his dad.

30
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,774
- Michael: Grandpa's
original dog tag from Korea.

31
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,910
Your dog tag
and then my dog tag.

32
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:19,580
You got my uncle, Les,
and cousin, Verle.

33
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,216
He was in Korea and Vietnam.

34
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,984
- Angela: During the pandemic,

35
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,554
Michael started tracing
his family's story.

36
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:32,192
- I think on his mother's side,
how far back he got.

37
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:36,196
'Cause he got back
into the 1700s.

38
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,465
- Michael: There's eight
generations of military

39
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,701
in my family
that I've been able to trace

40
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,671
from the Revolutionary War
until Iraq and Afghanistan.

41
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,206
- Angela: This Iraq War veteran

42
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,675
has made some
fascinating discoveries

43
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,211
that make his family unique.

44
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,780
- Every story is unbelievable.

45
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,917
James Buchanan, the 15th
president of the United States,

46
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,020
is my fourth
or fifth great-uncle.

47
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,722
He's not the greatest president
in the world,

48
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,958
considered the father
of the American Civil War,

49
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,495
but it's exciting for me to be
able to trace that lineage,

50
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,931
that I am related
to a U.S. president.

51
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,733
To my knowledge,
I have three relatives

52
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,101
that fought
in the Revolutionary War.

53
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,171
Like General Samuel Sloan
from the Massachusetts militia.

54
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,340
He was also at the
Battle of Ticonderoga.

55
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,875
He's my sixth great-grandfather,

56
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:26,480
so that is great, great, great,
great, great, great-grandfather.

57
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,814
...To England.

58
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,052
I'm sure we have relatives that
fought for the English.

59
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,888
I don't have links on them yet.

60
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,056
Key word is "yet."

61
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,658
I will find them.

62
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,459
- Angela: Now,
it is Grandpa George

63
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,695
who is finding inspiration
from Michael.

64
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,863
- Michael: ...My tattoo.

65
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,332
This is my grandfather's
Aunt Madeline.

66
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:49,436
She was a nurse in the
nurse corps for World War II.

67
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,739
- That boy has done
tremendous work

68
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,311
in getting all this stuff
together.

69
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,713
- So this is what I've been able
to come up with

70
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,716
for your dad, is his
Certificate of Military Service.

71
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:07,354
He served from March of 1918
until January of 1919.

72
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,925
- And I'm very proud of what
he's put together, y'know.

73
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:16,330
I practically raised that boy.
[voice breaks]

74
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,000
Can't help it.

75
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm proud of him with what
he has turned out to be.

76
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,309
He's as good as gold.

77
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,113
So I'm very proud of you.
- I'm proud of you too, Grandpa.

78
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,281
[chuckles]

79
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,351
Well, there's nobody like him.

80
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,222
- You got that right.
[Michael laughs]

81
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,391
- Angela: One veteran
sharing his story

82
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,962
has resulted in nearly 1,000
new family stories.

83
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:52,266
- Michael: It was daunting,
but I have 997 people

84
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,568
on my ancestry family tree
right now.

85
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,903
- Yeah, it's amazing.

86
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,906
I can't believe some of the
things he's got over there.

87
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,643
From his grandmother's side,
his mother's side,

88
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,378
and my side.

89
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,281
Proud of you, son.
- Michael: Thank you.

90
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,016
So...
- Yeah.

91
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,753
- Angela: The quest to find
more stories continues,

92
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,589
and Michael's military pride
will be preserved

93
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,991
for generations to come.

94
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,994
- Michael: I don't know why,
what drives me.

95
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,330
I think it's my passion
because I'm a veteran,

96
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,433
my grandfather's a veteran,
my father's a veteran.

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,068
I'm very proud of my family.

98
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,103
What's your serial number,
Grandpa?

99
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,839
- 1392117.

100
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,541
- Michael:
It's a humbling experience,

101
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,109
it's exciting.

102
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:40,681
It's cool to just be able to say
I have all of this history

103
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,416
in my family.

104
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,519
