1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
What role did
Wisconsin play in the American Revolution?

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,766
That is not a trick question.

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,800
Even if Wisconsin wasn't a state yet.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,200
Essentially every Native nation
east of the Mississippi

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,233
River was involved in this conflict
in one degree or another.

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,766
Here in what we presently call
Wisconsin, the vast majority 
of the tribes

7
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:22,800
are aligned in sentiment
and interest with Britain

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,900
because Britain is a new, 
beneficent European partner.

9
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:31,966
By this point in time
in Indigenous history 
in North America,

10
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:35,600
all of these tribes have established
some degree of economic

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,900
dependency with European trading partners.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,233
So while we may not have

13
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:43,400
the Revolutionary battlefields
you'll find on the East Coast,

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
the Upper Midwest
and the Indigenous peoples here

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,500
were absolutely part of the 
conflict and history that gave birth to our nation.
