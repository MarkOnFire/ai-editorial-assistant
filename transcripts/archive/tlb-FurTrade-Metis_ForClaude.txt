1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,044
The term "métis" refers to
the ethnicity and culture

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,547
that developed around the
children of European traders

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,132
and Indigenous women.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,301
Métis people used elements from
both their parents' cultures,

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,137
like parts of their
different languages.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,973
They also adopted new cultural
elements for themselves,

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,393
like a type of woven belt
called a ceinture fléchée

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,645
that reflected their
fur-trading roots.

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,190
Métis people became a key part
of the North American fur trade.

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,152
They supplied trading posts
with goods, provided food

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,488
like pemmican, a type
of dried beef to travelers,

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,615
and worked as clerks
for trading companies,

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,617
among other types of labor.

14
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,619
Despite their rich history
and traditions,

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,622
Métis people have struggled
for official recognition.

16
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,750
The Canadian government
didn't recognize them

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,753
as an Aboriginal group
until 1982,

18
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,130
and the U.S. still
doesn't recognize them.
