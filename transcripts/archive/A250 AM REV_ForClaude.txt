1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,433
No taxation without representation.

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,800
The absolute tyranny of King George III

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,333
If you studied the American 
Revolution as a kid in school

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,200
 there's a good chance

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,166
that you learned something
along those lines

6
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,733
as the root causes of the 
colonists’ desire for independence.

7
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,766
That is not at all the full story.

8
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:20,166
UW Madison military history
professor John W Hall explains more.

9
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,266
One of the other major
grievances is the sense

10
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,533
mounting through 
the 1760s and into the 1770s,

11
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,700
that the King is going to deny

12
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:31,500
the colonists their rightful birthright

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,600
to all of North America,

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,100
to include those lands
that are inhabited by American Indians.

15
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,466
Basically, settlers wanted more land.

16
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,966
This is not to say the American
Revolution was only about land.

17
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,166
There were many factors.

18
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,466
And I would argue that much of ensuing American history

19
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:49,600
is kind of a struggle of the 
United States to live up to

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,033
ideals that are embodied

21
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,433
in the Declaration of Independence.

22
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:55,266
 Ideals we are still trying to live up to today.
