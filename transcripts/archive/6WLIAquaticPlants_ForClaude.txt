1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,071
Aquatic plants photosynthesize

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,606
and therefore provide

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,373
dissolved oxygen

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,108
within the lake.

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,978
That's really important

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,312
for underwater critters

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,648
to be able to respirate.

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,117
The work that we do

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,852
involves going to a lake.

10
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,354
and we go from sample point

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,688
to sample point in a boat

12
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,890
and we rake up the

13
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,091
aquatic plants

14
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,125
and we take a look

15
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,393
at the species present

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,928
at that sample point.

17
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,363
And we do that

18
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,198
at least 200 times in a day.

19
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:31,965
And when you do that

20
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,233
a couple hundred times,

21
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,002
or maybe even a thousand times

22
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,736
in a lake,

23
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,970
you really get a good picture

24
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,372
of what the aquatic plant

25
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,341
community is like in that lake.
