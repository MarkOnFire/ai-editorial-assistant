1
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,045
- Dawry: No quiero practicar
l'alambre alto!

2
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,815
- Kai: [sighs]
Just one more hour.

3
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,451
Then you get a habanero treat.

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:22,256
- Dos delicias de habanero
y un wasabi smoothie?

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,892
- Kai: [laughs]
Okay, deal!

6
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,266
- Estoy mejorando!
[Kai laughs]

7
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,468
- I knew you could do it!

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,471
- Shepherd: So what's
going on here?

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,673
How did these actors know
what to say?

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,009
Well, they had a script.

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,846
And that is what
we are going to write today.

12
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,915
- A script is like a tool
for an actor.

13
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,384
It tells us what to say
and what to do.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,453
Whether we're in a movie,
a TV show, a podcast,

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,722
or even a video, like this one!

16
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,291
That's right, we have a script,

17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,960
and it's like a special set
of instructions.

18
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,162
- Because these are
special instructions,

19
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,798
we use punctuation
in special ways.

20
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,201
We use a colon to mean "says"

21
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,636
and parentheses
to mean "does."

22
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:13,273
When you see a colon, you say
what's after the colon.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,244
When you see a parentheses, you
do what's in the parentheses,

24
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,213
but you don't say it out loud.

25
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,747
Because it's a special form,

26
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,317
you don't need to use
quotation marks.

27
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,387
The colon is enough to let
the actor know what to say.

28
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,823
- So the play that we just saw

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,960
looked a little something
like this.

30
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,530
- Dawry: No quiero practicar
l'alambre alto!

31
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,099
- Kai: [sighs]
Just one more hour.

32
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,668
Then you get a habanero treat.

33
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,206
- Dos delicias de habanero
y un wasabi smoothie ?

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,876
- [laughs]
Okay, deal!

35
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,450
- Estoy mejorando!
[Kai laughs]

36
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,652
- I knew you could do it!

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,290
- So how do we come up
with an idea

38
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,459
for a script in the first place?

39
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,528
Well, remember to brainstorm.

40
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,331
Once we have our character,
our plot, and our setting,

41
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,700
then we're all set
to write a story.

42
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,036
Let's improvise a story together

43
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,606
and we'll write it down
as we go along, yeah?

44
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,009
Do I have any volunteers?

45
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,845
Excellent, okay.

46
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,281
So the first thing that
we are going to look for

47
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,715
is two characters.

48
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,151
We need two characters.

49
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,986
Anila, one character please.

50
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:36,857
- Um...Peppa Pig.
- Shepherd: Peppa Pig.

51
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,627
Can I make her spicy?
- Anila: Yes.

52
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,297
- Can I make her Pepper Pig?
- Anila: Pepper Pig.

53
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,464
- Pepper Pig, okay.

54
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,133
And who's the second character?

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,235
- Jay: Asmadeus.
- Who's that?

56
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,670
- A poisonous snake.

57
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,238
- A poisonous snake, excellent,
excellent.

58
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,673
All right,
here's my next question.

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,841
Where are they?

60
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,008
- Finnegan:
Arches National Park.

61
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,743
- Utah, nice!

62
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,478
Excellent, okay.

63
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,582
So we've got Pepper Pig,
we've got Asmadeus.

64
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,018
They are
at Arches National Park.

65
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,288
Asmadeus is a really,
really long name.

66
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,823
But since we only
have two characters

67
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,992
and both of the characters start
with two different letters,

68
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,894
we can simplify this
for ourselves.

69
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,062
Watch.

70
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,296
We're gonna write an "A."

71
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,631
Write an "A."
- Great.

72
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,799
- Boom.

73
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,634
And then, what comes next
when we wanna say

74
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,204
that our character
is saying something?

75
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,372
Gigi, what is it?

76
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,709
- The colon?
- Shepherd: Yes, it is!

77
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,043
- Oh, yeah!
- Shepherd: Boom!

78
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,912
The colon looks like this,
two dots.

79
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,114
- Jay: Can I say
what I want him to say?

80
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,951
- You have a line for Asmadeus?
- I will kill you!

81
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,153
- Shepherd: Excellent!
- Kai: Wow, right off the bat!

82
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,321
- Right off the bat.

83
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,856
It sounds like something
he would say.

84
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,992
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm not gonna lie.

85
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,394
Now, here's my question.

86
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,164
Is Asmadeus doing something
with his body when he says that?

87
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,366
- Yes.
- Yes.

88
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,534
- Yes, okay.

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,935
What is he doing with his body?

90
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,237
- He's, like, shaking his tail
and making hissing sounds,

91
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,540
and, like, creeping him out.
- Group: Ooh!

92
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,343
- Shepherd: Okay, and since that
is an action,

93
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,412
what do we put there?

94
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,047
Yes?
- Parentheses.

95
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,415
- Parentheses!
- Yes!

96
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:13,020
- Boom, one there, and then
shaking his tail.

97
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,655
Yes, Anila,
what's Pepper Pig say?

98
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,090
- [yawns] I'm so hungry.

99
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,693
- Shepherd: Oh, I'm so hungry,
and is she doing that too?

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,095
- And she's gonna go to sleep
after when she's done eating.

101
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,263
- Sheperd: Oh, okay.

102
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,366
So, "I'm so hungry,"
and then in what?

103
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,968
- Group: In parentheses!

104
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,705
- Nice, in parentheses,
should we put sleepy?

105
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,707
Does that make sense, 'cause
she's gonna go to bed?

106
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,875
Should we put sleepy?

107
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,277
What does Asmadeus say
when he sees Pepper Pig?

108
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,445
Yes?

109
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,047
- I'm gonna eat your toes.
[group exclaims]

110
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,448
- Shepherd: I'm gonna eat your
toes!

111
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,616
- Kai: Nasty!

112
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,618
- Not if I eat yours first.
- Shepherd: Ooh!

113
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,353
[Kai laughs]
Yes!

114
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,722
- I don't have toes.

115
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,490
Sick burn.
- Shepherd: Sick,

116
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,426
could it be like,
"Om nom nom nom?"

117
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,827
- Kai: Yes!
- Shepherd: Sick burn?

118
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:54,995
- Yes, and, like, sassy.

119
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,164
- Shepherd: Like sassy,
like a little snake.

120
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,498
Finnegan, what else?

121
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,769
- And maybe Asmadeus could
chomp, like, eat Pepper Pig?

122
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,073
- And then, and then?
- Jay: The end!

123
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,247
- Pepper on the Pig.

124
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,617
- Pepper, I will kill you!

125
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,288
- [yawns] I'm so hungry!
[laughter]

126
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,757
- I'm gonna eat your toes.

127
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,894
- Not if I eat yours first!

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,862
- I don't have toes.

129
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,597
Sssick burn!

130
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,501
[gasps]
[laughter]

131
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,470
- Shepherd: The end!

132
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,273
[applause and cheers]

133
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,208
- Scriptwriting is the
ultimate way

134
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,477
to support each other's ideas!

135
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,313
You can support each other
by writing a script together,

136
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,015
by acting out the script
together,

137
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,285
or you can have your friends
support your ideas

138
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,720
by having them act out
your script.

139
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,024
And remember, if you get stuck,
just go back to the brainstorm.

140
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,759
Happy writing!
