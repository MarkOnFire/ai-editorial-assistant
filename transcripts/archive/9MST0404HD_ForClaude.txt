We thank the underwriters

of <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets,</i>

00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,481
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,251
- My father taught me
that to make great bakery,

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,886
you have to do it the right way.

- Yes, Greendale
is beautiful on the outside,

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,299
but it's what's inside
that counts.

12

Who doesn't love opening a door
to great food?

13
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,239
Whether you want to go casual...

14

Lakes, festivals,

One word, one place: Minocqua.

00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,087
- I am in Cedar Rapids,
which is named after the rapids

40
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:04,258
of the Cedar River, which
have since been tamed by dams.

41
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,394
The population of Cedar Rapids
is about 137,000 people,

42
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,863
which makes it
the second-largest city

43
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,298
in the state of Iowa.

44
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,401
The only city bigger--
Des Moines.

45
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,837
Cedar Rapids is in eastern Iowa,

46
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,939
about an hour and a half
west of the Mississippi

47
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,109
and a half-hour north
of Iowa City.

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,280
Ushers Ferry Historic Village.
- Emmy Fink: Take a look around.

49
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,916
We're gonna start our story
in the 1800s

50
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,952
with the first European settler
to come to this area.

51
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,987
He built a log cabin
along the river,

52
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,455
and his name
was Osgood Shepherd.

53
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,623
- Osgood Shepherd.

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,659
So he was the founder
of Cedar Rapids.

55
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,094
- He probably could have,
except, here's the thing,

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,696
he was a little bit
of a scoundrel.

57
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,031
- John: Ooh.

58
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,800
- Maybe even a horse thief,
but definitely a squatter.

59
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,302
He basically settled
on the land,

60
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,903
but had no legal claim to it.

61
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,105
- So we're not gonna find
a statue of him downtown.

62
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,941
- Not in this town, anyway.

63
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,342
So, but in 1841,

64
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,811
a group of good citizens,
they came together.

65
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,947
They bought Osgood out,
and they're the ones

66
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,114
who founded the town.

67
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,282
And really, look around.

68
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,384
Some of these buildings
are original

69
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,854
to that time in the late 1800s.

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,188
And, I mean, just imagine

71
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,691
a lot of people bustling around
'cause it was a big hub

72
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,926
for business, especially
food-related business.

73
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,294
- Food, and we're in Iowa,

74
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,630
so the food--
so we have to talk about corn.

75
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,166
- Emmy: Exactly--
oats, corn, and meat packing.

76
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,601
- John: And no more
horse thieves?

77
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,437
- I mean, not that I've seen,
but should we be on the lookout?

78
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,639
- You go that way,
and I'll go this way, okay?

79
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,407
- Oh, I'm looking.

80
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,809
- John: We're at
a beautiful place

81
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,177
called the Hotel
at Kirkwood Center.

82
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,746
So when I walked in,
this is what I thought.

83
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,214
"Is it a Marriott?

84
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,582
Is this a Hilton?"

85
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,118
What, like, whose hotel is this?

86
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,687
- Jackie Bohr: So we are not
affiliated with any brand.

87
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,390
We sit on the Kirkwood
Community College campus,

88
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:48,462
and we are, as far as we know,
the only AAA Four Diamond

89
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,732
two-year hospitality school
in the United States

90
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,066
that's a teaching hotel.

91
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,269
- So it's teaching
those in this industry--

92
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,204
the food industry,
the hotel industry.

93
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,773
- Jackie: Yes, we have
a two-year culinary arts program

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,776
as well as a two-year
hospitality management program,

95
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,112
which is focused on
the front-of-the-house service,

96
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,015
so they work side by side
with our professional staff

97
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,784
to learn what it's like
every single day

98
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,753
working in the
hospitality industry.

99
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,555
- Hey, guys, my name's John.
- Kathy: Hi.

100
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,023
This is your classroom?

101
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,825
- Brian Crowell: Oh, my gosh, I
have the best job in the world.

102
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,160
Did you not know that?

103
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,162
Culinary's been my whole life,
so I love this program.

104
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,330
It's great.

105
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,332
The best part of it is,
I get to take

106
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,934
all this real-world experience,
everything that I've done,

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,336
and I get to come back
and give this to the students.

108
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,938
The first thing is really
building the flavor,

109
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,940
so as we have each of these
with individual flavors,

110
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,342
we need to brighten them
and liven 'em up a little bit.

111
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,544
- I'll take over that,
if you wanna start the salad?

112
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,146
- Kathy: Okay.
- Brian: There you go.

113
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,314
- John: Look at me.

114
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,416
Chef Kathy will leave
and find her job.

115
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,584
- Brian: Yep.

116
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,385
- John: And then
make this her own somewhere.

117
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,553
- Brian: Correct.

118
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,955
You did good.
- Kathy: Thank you.

119
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,122
- Brian: She did good.

120
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,324
It's not just cooking and food.

121
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,525
You have to understand
the financials.

122
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,726
You have to understand
the hospitality.

123
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,127
You have to understand
how people interact.

124
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,530
You have to understand
how to menu and plan,

125
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,032
and it's just, there's a lot
of aspects to this business.

126
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,434
- John: They did well,
didn't they?

127
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,602
Good job, you guys.

128
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,203
- These guys are rock stars,
I swear.

129
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,205
- And the one thing
that I love about being

130
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,876
in this industry is, there's
never the same day twice.

131
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,210
You never know
what's gonna happen.

132
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,812
You never know what
you're gonna walk into.

133
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,013
- John: And isn't that part

134
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,815
of the sort of excitement
of all of it?

135
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:15,983
- Totally.

136
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,384
- And you can't
really teach that.

137
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,752
That has to be done here.

138
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,154
- Jackie: They have to feel it
and live it to understand,

139
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,558
and it's a lot of fun to watch
them recognize these things

140
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,193
that they're seeing
for the first time

141
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,628
and are like, "Oh, yeah.

142
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,297
Like, this is pretty cool that
I chose this industry to go in."

143
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,266
- John: It's great.
- Jackie: Yeah.

144
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,101
- Cedar Rapids feeds the world.

145
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,435
Take a look.

146
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,804
That Quaker Oats plant,
it's big.

147
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,375
In fact, it's the largest
cereal mill in the world.

148
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,711
They make Life cereal,
and they make oatmeal,

149
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:50,050
in fact, enough oatmeal
to fill 3 million bowls a day.

150
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,218
Yeah.

151
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,419
Did you know that General Mills,

152
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,655
the General Mills plant
here in Cedar Rapids,

153
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,724
is the largest General Mills
plant in the country?

154
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,459
They make Cheerios,

155
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,362
they make Fruit Roll-Ups--
yes, they do--

156
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,098
and they make-- come on--
Betty Crocker frosting,

157
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,367
all here in Cedar Rapids.

158
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,703
And this is a stupid question,
but do you ever--

159
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,439
do you ever eat,
let's say, bread?

160
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,842
Yeah, you know, the yeast
that is in this bread

161
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,978
probably came from the largest
yeast factory in the world

162
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,180
called Red Star Yeast,

163
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:24,985
and, you guessed it,
right here in Cedar Rapids.

164
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,623
Cedar Rapids feeds the world,
and I love to be fed.

165
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,994
[groovy music]

166
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:39,032
Favorite part, talk about food,
this is Willie Ray's Q Shack.

167
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,268
So your name really isn't
Willie Ray, is it?

168
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,469
- Willie Fairley:
First and middle.

169
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,670
- Oh, it's first and middle.

170
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,072
- First and middle.
- That worked.

171
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,273
How long you been doing this?

172
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,675
- I've been in business
since July 8 of 2019.

173
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,677
- How did COVID affect you?

174
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,312
- Most restaurants was closing,

175
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,015
and so happened,
we had a drive-through,

176
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,884
so you had a choice.

177
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,852
You want Burger King,
McDonald's,

178
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,888
those type places,
or you want to try Willie Ray's?

179
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,956
I don't wish it again,
but we gotta--

180
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,759
- Right, put you on the map.
- Willie: Put us on the map.

181
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,160
We focus on the ribs,
the chicken,

182
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,395
and the pulled pork.

183
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,664
- John: Is it like Kansas City
or North Carolina?

184
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,267
It's dry rub or vinegar,
or what do you have going?

185
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,002
- I call it
a Mississippi style

186
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,404
'cause that's where I'm from,
this is where I learned it at.

187
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,706
And we do it a little different,
but, you know--

188
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,341
- So what is
Mississippi style,

189
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,676
for those that don't know?

190
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:23,844
- We call it babysitting.

191
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,112
You don't leave
a baby unattended.

192
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,413
You don't
leave the food unattended.

193
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,781
Somebody gots to watch it.

194
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,683
- John: Yeah,
and what's the best meal

195
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,686
if I were to sit down at
your place and have some ribs?

196
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,688
- Willie: Well, I would
recommend the 2 and 2.

197
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,089
You get two-piece chicken
and two ribs,

198
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,058
or you get
the pulled pork with two ribs.

199
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,593
Come on, John, where are you at?

200
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,395
You on break, John?

201
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,729
- 2 and 2.

202
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,731
- Willie: All right, you wanna
slice between the bones

203
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,899
there in the middle.

204
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,501
- John: Right
in the middle of it.

205
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,303
- Willie: Yeah, you get
some beans right there.

206
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,704
- Potato salad.
- Willie: Oh, yeah.

207
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,039
- John: Mayonnaise-based?
- Willie: Yep.

208
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,440
- Do you know,
there's another kind

209
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,608
with vinegar and bacon?

210
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,776
You know that kind?

211
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,377
- Willie: We'll leave that
to the Carolinas.

212
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,645
- Okay, very good.
[chuckles]

213
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,848
- Pick whatever two you want.
- Let's do these two.

214
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,383
Look at that, that's experience.

215
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,885
Order up!

216
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,286
We heard that
if there's a storm,

217
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,721
if there's a tornado,
if something happens

218
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,957
that's catastrophic, that
you're out there feeding people.

219
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,926
- Yeah, it started
during the derecho.

220
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,094
- What is a derecho?

221
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,963
- Well, derecho
is a hurricane on land.

222
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,165
I think they said
it took out 40% of trees

223
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,501
or 50% of trees
that's here in town,

224
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,035
put the whole city out of power,

225
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,104
and we just thought
it was the time,

226
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,273
and we started giving out meals,
and we did it

227
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,076
for about a month and a half,
and we took it on the road.

228
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,312
We've been to Texas, Louisiana,
Kentucky twice,

229
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,714
and that's what
it's about to me.

230
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,283
It's about showing love,
that passion and love,

231
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,318
and passion plus love
equal Willie Ray's,

232
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,486
like a math problem.

233
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,422
- John: It's so good,
it's so good.

234
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,590
Hungry.

235
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,292
To you, Willie.
- Yeah.

236
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,693
- Good job, thank you so much.

237
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,095
- Willie: Seasoned
with love, man.

238
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,298
- John: You're the best, man.
[chuckles]

239
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,800
- Emmy: If you're looking
to escape the hustle and bustle

240
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,537
of downtown,
drive just a few minutes here

241
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,405
to the Indian Creek
Nature Center

242
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,609
because this place has it all,
over 400 acres to explore.

243
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,012
Find your peace and tranquility.

244
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,847
You can visit
the bird sanctuary.

245
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,349
You can view the honeybee hive.

246
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,753
Learn about the birds
and the bees right here.

247
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,221
[gentle music]

248
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,422
- John: We're on a farm.

249
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,823
- Clint Twedt-Ball:
We're on a farm.

250
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,225
- In the middle of Cedar Rapids.

251
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,227
- Yeah, isn't that crazy?
- It really is crazy.

252
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,395
- Right.

253
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,597
- How big is this farm,
and what goes on here?

254
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,399
- Yeah, it's about
two and a half acres,

255
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,000
and tons of different things
go on here.

256
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,502
So we grow a lot, obviously.

257
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,138
We have kids' camps,
farmers' markets.

258
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,975
We do educational classes,
we do community gatherings.

259
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,845
- John: How did this urban farm
end up in this neighborhood?

260
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,480
- Clint: In 2008,
we had a huge flood.

261
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,084
We would have been under about
12 feet of water right here.

262
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,653
About 1,500 houses
were torn down.

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,488
We talk about it
as a blighted area

264
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,258
and a low-income neighborhood,
and we thought,

265
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,460
"What if we turned that blight
into beauty?

266
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,363
What if we made this
into kind of a food oasis?"

267
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,900
- John: It's part of Matthew 25,
which is an organization.

268
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,702
- Clint: Right.
- John: How does that work?

269
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,103
- Really, Matthew 25
is an organization

270
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,038
that revitalizes neighborhoods.

271
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,708
We run a grocery store about
a block and a half from here

272
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,610
that, again, is helping
to eliminate

273
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,378
the food desert that's here.

274
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,614
We run a café
that's a pay-it-forward café

275
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,184
where anybody can come and eat
fresh, healthy, local food

276
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,486
for whatever they
can afford to pay.

277
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,421
Other people kind of tip
a little extra

278
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,557
so that they can pay
for people's meals.

279
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,158
We run a tool library.

280
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:29,530
We help 20 homeowners to fix up
their homes every year.

281
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,599
We teach classes
at local schools on gardening

282
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,868
and lots of different things
that we're doing.

283
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,270
- John: Really important work.

284
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,437
It's the flower greenhouse.

285
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,605
Is that what's going on?

286
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,042
- Food, flower, herbs,
but we sell.

287
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,777
That's part of how
we fund the farm,

288
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,846
is by a huge plant sale
that we do.

289
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,915
I think we had, like,
400 people that came here

290
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,616
and bought plants this spring.

291
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,618
- John: So we're here
at the end of May,

292
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,420
so is this the busiest time
for you guys?

293
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,756
- Clint: This is the craziest
time because, you know,

294
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,658
not only is everything
growing new,

295
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,426
but all the weeds
are growing new, and--

296
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,562
- John: Just for us
who need to understand

297
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,830
why it was called Matthew 25,

298
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,999
can we talk about
the Book of Matthew?

299
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,634
- Where Jesus says,

300
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,204
"Whatever you did for the least
of these, you did for me,

301
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,206
"so whenever I was hungry
and you fed me,

302
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,809
naked and you clothed me,
a stranger and you welcomed me."

303
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,580
And so we just believe
that our faith calls us

304
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:23,050
to invest in overlooked people
and places, so.

305
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,852
- John: It's the living gospel.
- Clint: Yeah.

306
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,420
- Good work.
- Thanks.

307
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,621
- Thanks for talking to me.

308
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,891
- Clint: Yeah, thank you.
- John: Thanks.

309
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,660
That is a government building
in downtown Cedar Rapids.

310
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,062
Now, it's certainly not unusual

311
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,631
to find a government building
in a downtown location,

312
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,734
but there's something unusual
about these buildings,

313
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,402
something that is shared

314
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:46,006
with only two other cities
in the world.

315
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,574
Can you guess what that is?

316
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,309
[playful music]

317
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,613
- These government buildings
behind me,

318
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,548
they're on their own island.

319
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,550
City officials didn't
want to have to favor

320
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,685
one side of the river
over the other,

321
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,089
so just buy the whole island
like they did in 1909.

322
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,657
They named it Mays Island.

323
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:08,161
It's only like this in two
other places: Paris and Japan.

324
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,897
[bright music]

325
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,332
- That was
a carriage house to a mansion

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,636
that was built in the late 1800s
and later became the home

327
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:21,775
and the studio of Grant Wood,
the famous son of Cedar Rapids.

328
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,377
It's roomy, huh?

329
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,046
- Sean Ulmer: It was just
a very wide open hayloft

330
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,448
when Grant Wood moved in,

331
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,218
and he realized this could be
a livable space

332
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,654
and he wouldn't have to pay
to live someplace else.

333
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,089
He made a lot of modifications
while he was here.

334
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,958
He put in this fireplace.

335
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,761
As a hood, he took
a metal bushel basket

336
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,296
and turned it upside down.

337
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,897
- Could we light it up
today, Sean?

338
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,299
Come on.
- No, not today, no.

339
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,567
We've closed that part off.

340
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,569
He and his mom, who were
the primary residents here,

341
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,838
they had their beds
in these nooks here.

342
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,708
In this slope of the roof line,
he created these bins

343
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,977
that he could pull out
and store all of his paintings.

344
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,145
- John: Smart.

345
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,746
- He made use
of every single space.

346
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,948
- John: And here he is.

347
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,149
- Sean: Wearing
his bib overalls,

348
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,317
which is his work uniform.

349
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,519
It was while he was here
he had his big break.

350
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:07,354
He had his big break
with <i>American Gothic.</i>

351
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,755
- John: <i>American Gothic.</i>
- Sean: Yes.

352
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,257
- Why did he call it that?

353
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,259
Is it because it's the way
they're dressed?

354
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,794
No.

355
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,496
It's a gothic window
on a farmhouse

356
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,799
in the middle of Iowa,
inspired by the house...

357
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,967
- By the house.

358
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,568
That's where it started.
- Not the subjects.

359
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,570
- Sean: He wondered what kind
of people would live

360
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,372
in such a house,
so he created this couple,

361
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,242
and his sitters
were his sister, Nan,

362
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,745
and his dentist,
Dr. Byron McKeeby.

363
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,714
Some people say, "Well,
are they husband and wife?"

364
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,516
And others say, "Well,
is it father and daughter?"

365
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:39,219
Eventually Nan said,
"Oh, I'm gonna clear this up.

366
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,054
He's way too old for me
to have married."

367
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,056
- Right.
- And so she used to always--

368
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,459
- And he's a dentist, right?
- Yeah, and he's a dentist.

369
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,261
There was no
relationship at all.

370
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,230
He liked the way they looked
in front of this farmhouse.

371
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,566
- So he painted that,
became successful,

372
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,368
and then, I guess,
moved out of here, right?

373
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,270
- Not immediately,
not immediately, no.

374
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,472
- John: He stayed here
in this space for a while?

375
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,073
- Sean: Yeah,
for another five years, yeah.

376
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,675
- John: How many original
Grant Wood pieces

377
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,544
are there in your museum?

378
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,680
- Sean: In our museum, we have
nearly 300 works by Grant Wood.

379
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,483
He was actually a much more
sophisticated artist

380
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,285
than a lot of people
give him credit for.

381
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,153
The <i>American Gothic</i>
is arguably

382
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,355
the most famous
American painting of all time.

383
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,690
In recognition,

384
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,425
it's probably second
only to the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

385
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:21,028
- John: Yeah.
- Sean: Certainly in parodies,

386
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,896
maybe even surpasses
the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

387
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:26,066
- And parody is but flattery,
really, don't you think?

388
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,868
- Sean: It can be,
yes, it can be.

389
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,870
I think Grant Wood would love
the fact that people

390
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,972
are still paying attention
to <i>American Gothic,</i>

391
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,043
and how it's still relevant
to their lives today.

392
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,045
- The Museum of Art
certainly has a large collection

393
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,947
of Grant Wood paintings,

394
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:44,618
but it also has one of Iowa's
only collections of--

395
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:45,786
Can you guess?

396
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,521
[playful music]

397
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,724
- This museum actually
has one of the only collections

398
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,527
of Roman artifacts in Iowa.

399
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,596
I mean, we're not sure
what they all are,

400
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,798
but it's pretty cool that
they date all the way back

401
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,766
to first century BC.

402
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,135
[upbeat music]

403
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,071
- John: This
is a very cool place.

404
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,239
It's called Newbo Market.

405
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,541
- Julie Parisi: In here,
we have about 25, 26

406
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,276
individually-owned
small businesses.

407
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,279
We really help to incubate them
as little baby businesses

408
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,981
to grow up and become

409
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,582
sustainable,
long-term businesses.

410
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,184
- And what happens
once they grow up?

411
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,352
Do they--

412
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,621
- Julie: We hope they
fly the nest and occupy

413
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,390
a small space out in the
community as a brick-and-mortar

414
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,058
and stick around
for a long time.

415
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,660
- John: What a place
for the community.

416
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,629
Come in one door,
and you've got it all.

417
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,564
- Julie: Yep, you've got food,
retail products.

418
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,000
None of these things you
can find on Amazon, you know?

419
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,668
- John: Good;
Emmy, say hi to Julie.

420
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:35,936
- Hi, Julie.
- Hey, welcome.

421
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,104
- I'm ready to eat.

422
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,872
John's gonna shop,
and I'll eat, okay?

423
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,040
- Julie: Okay, good plan.

424
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,241
- Emmy: This is Food Alley.

425
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,409
Oh, ho ho ho!

426
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,411
- John: You need to go
to the Caribbean Kitchen.

427
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:45,612
You need to order
something jerk.

428
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,414
- Emmy: Jerk.
- John: Can you remember that?

429
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:48,815
- Emmy: Yeah, are you a jerk?

430
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,417
- Patrick Rashed:
I have what you need,

431
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,520
and I'm Jamaican,
so typically jerk chicken.

432
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:54,922
- Emmy: All right,
the jerk chicken.

433
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,089
That's what we want.

434
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,257
Come to mama.

435
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,592
Thank you so much.

436
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,427
- Ah, brings me back.

437
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,429
I had a macrame lamp.

438
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,732
It was an overhead lamp
over my dining room.

439
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,000
- Stephanie Hanna: Oh, wow, yep.

440
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,402
- That was so great.
- Yeah.

441
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,604
- John: So this is your shop?
- Stephanie: Yes, sir.

442
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,606
- John: And you have a shop
across the way?

443
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,808
- Stephanie: I do.
- Look at the one I grabbed.

444
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,976
I said, "What is this?"

445
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,444
She said, "It's for pride."

446
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,247
I was like, "Well, look at me,"
and I'm the one that grabbed it.

447
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,415
Of course I did.

448
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,417
- What would be
the best thing to get here?

449
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,818
- Neha Kuchhal: Well,
everything is vegetarian,

450
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,420
so it's cinnamon, nutmeg,
cardamom, plenty of vegetables.

451
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,721
It's all the flavor
combined together.

452
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,323
- Emmy: I smell them all
right now.

453
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,591
They smell delicious.

454
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,026
This looks beautiful.
- I think this is very cool.

455
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,962
Have you ever heard
of a typewriter poem?

456
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,564
- Missa Coffman: If somebody
has an idea for a poem,

457
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,633
they tell me,
and I just write one

458
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,203
right here at the typewriter,
takes about 15 or 20 minutes.

459
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,605
- John: So they
could shop around

460
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,107
and come back for the poem.
- Missa: Sure can.

461
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,509
- Oh, my gosh, sit down.

462
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,676
- Well, look at you.

463
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,844
And I'm taking these home.

464
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:52,312
What are you gonna do
with yours?

465
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,314
- Emmy: I'm gonna eat them
and take nothing home.

466
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,851
- John: Is that right?
- Mm, I'm into the jerk.

467
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,820
- This is my co-host.

468
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:01,855
She's jerky.

469
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:03,590
[upbeat music]

470
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,159
- This landmark
is called Mother Mosque,

471
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,428
and who would've thought
Iowa would have

472
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,298
the oldest mosque
anywhere in the United States?

473
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,169
In 1934, Muslim immigrants
from Lebanon and Syria,

474
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:18,238
they came here and built this
as their place of worship.

475
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,706
Well, they've outgrown it,

476
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,308
and they've built
a new place of worship,

477
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,312
but this continues as their
cultural and heritage center.

478
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,482
- I am in the Grand Lodge
of Masons of Iowa,

479
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,384
and this is
the War Memorial Room.

480
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,788
Inside this building is
the Masonic Library and Museum.

481
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,591
Everything in the collection
was donated by members,

482
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:40,961
obviously with varied interests,
which is why you have

483
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:45,399
Japanese samurai armor
next to an original stone

484
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,901
from the foundation
of the White House.

485
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:49,636
[bright music]

486
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,872
We're at a company
called Raining Rose.

487
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,307
It's a manufacturing company,

488
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,142
and I don't know the name
Raining Rose.

489
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,810
- Nate Robson: We are
contract manufacturers,

490
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,245
so all the products
that we produce,

491
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,781
you can buy nationwide
in every major retailer,

492
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,416
but you'll never find
our name on it

493
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,318
because we produce it
for other brands.

494
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,652
- You make lip balm.

495
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,454
- We are known
for our lip balm, yes.

496
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,056
- You are known
for your lip balm?

497
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,657
- Yes; at one time, we were one

498
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,593
of the world's largest consumer
of organic beeswax.

499
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,495
- John: That's the beeswax.
- Nate: We make sunscreens.

500
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,665
We also make serums, vitamin C,
making that skin look good.

501
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:19,833
We do deodorants.

502
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,835
- John: And it all comes
out of Cedar Rapids.

503
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,237
- Nate: Comes out of right here.

504
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,605
We've got close
to 300 employees.

505
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,808
We're trying to find a balance
between profit and purpose

506
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,377
and really trying to leave
our community and the world

507
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,179
in a better place
than when we found it.

508
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,447
- John: Congratulations,
that's really great.

509
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,649
This is the cooking room?
- This is the cooking room.

510
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,584
This is a big kitchen,
but there's multiple chefs.

511
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:38,886
- John: There are, yeah.

512
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,088
- Nate: Yeah, and this is one
of the most difficult,

513
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,624
challenging jobs in the facility
because you gotta be precise

514
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,459
with the raw materials
you're putting in.

515
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,761
A mistake here
has a ripple effect

516
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,296
that's pretty large
downstream.

517
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:50,464
- Somebody's gonna be mad?

518
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:51,932
- So, yeah, somebody's
gonna be mad.

519
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,701
Put this in and then that in
and then heat it to this,

520
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,870
and that's exactly how
we make our product.

521
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:59,940
We've gone from pouring
lip balm into tubes manually

522
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,709
to using some of
the most high-end robotic

523
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:05,546
automation machines
that you can possibly create.

524
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,282
- And how many tubes
can you get outta here a day?

525
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,583
- It's over a million

526
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,252
if we dedicate it all
to lip balm filling.

527
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,987
So we do contract manufacturing

528
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,289
where we make products
for brands.

529
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,291
We also do promotional products.

530
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,193
These are the giveaways
that we're labeling up

531
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,761
with your unique logo on it.

532
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,062
We're doing that every day.

533
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,131
- Who's the product for?

534
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,699
- For John McGivern's Main...

535
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,134
- John: <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets.</i>

536
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,702
Have you ever seen that guy?

537
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,937
- No.
- He's so good.

538
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,338
- Worker: I'm gonna
ask the girls.

539
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,506
- Okay, no.

540
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,674
I'm just here to support.

541
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,075
[worker laughs]
- John: Is it done?

542
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,677
- Worker: Yeah.
- John: What the what?

543
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,145
- Worker: Mm-hmm.

544
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:42,115
We're gonna put this in the bag
since this is finished product.

545
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,283
[worker laughs]

546
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,618
- There would've been a
miscount.

547
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,786
- Perfect, I know.

548
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,387
- 'Cause I was gonna take one,
but...

549
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,223
<i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i> lip balm.

550
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,958
Gonna keep this one.

551
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,928
And my brother Tim,
my brother Jim, my brother Mike.

552
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,663
You want one?

553
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,933
- A mountain in Iowa.

554
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,035
I know, I was as surprised
as you are.

555
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,604
This is Mount Trashmore.

556
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,138
It used to be a landfill.

557
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,442
When they capped it off
at 6 million tons of garbage,

558
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,978
they decided to make it
into a beautiful space

559
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,047
for the Cedar Rapids community
to come and be active.

560
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,316
It's the highest point
in Linn County.

561
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,452
Check out this view,

562
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,389
and it's definitely not
a "waste" of time.

563
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,925
I know, I'm sorry.
[chuckles]

564
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:27,561
- I'm on the outside of
City Hall here in Cedar Rapids.

565
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:32,032
On the inside of this building,
there is a mark on the wall,

566
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,734
and you know what that mark is?

567
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,838
That's how high the water rose
during the flood of 2008.

568
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,874
When the community talks
about what they remember most

569
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,676
about that flood,
they talk about how

570
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:46,313
the community came together,
neighbor helping neighbor.

571
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,448
After the flood,
they used the opportunity

572
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,617
to make their city better.

573
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,019
Here on the west side,
they built

574
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,289
this beautiful amphitheater,
which also acts as a flood wall.

575
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,625
There's new condos and
new bars and new restaurants,

576
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,962
so the west side is part
of what makes Cedar Rapids

577
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,031
a great place to live.

578
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,069
We're at the National
Czech & Slovak Museum & Library

579
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:10,504
with the president.

580
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,906
- Cecilia Rokusek: As we would
say in our language, vitáme vás.

581
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,074
- Vitáme vás?

582
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:15,242
- Perfect.
- Oh, good.

583
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,443
- Hey, you're
an honorary Czecher.

584
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,845
- I was in Prague last year.

585
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,046
Let's talk about
how this happened

586
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,781
here in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

587
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,349
- Cecilia: Interestingly,
the state of Iowa

588
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,852
in the late 1800s
and early 1900s

589
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:28,188
was advertising for workers
in Central Europe,

590
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,390
and so a lot of these
immigrants came here.

591
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,292
In fact, my husband's father

592
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,228
was a 12-year-old
immigrant here,

593
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,697
and his parents were working
in the meatpacking industry.

594
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,032
There was a oat company,
which is now Quaker Oats.

595
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,635
And then if they were farmers,
with the Homestead Act,

596
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,437
they could get
a free plot of land.

597
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,572
So it was a great opportunity,

598
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,609
and almost 44%
of the population in 1914

599
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,811
was Czech in Cedar Rapids.

600
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,946
- So we just thought
there was a country

601
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,781
called Czechoslovakia, which...

602
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:55,983
- There was.
- There was.

603
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,085
- In 1918,
they became Czechoslovakia.

604
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,722
- John: Independence was found
when from Soviet Union?

605
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,924
- Cecilia: Actually, 1989,
the Velvet Revolution,

606
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:07,661
and then in 1993, they became
two independent nations:

607
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,830
the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

608
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,698
We went for the first time
in 1992,

609
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,033
and I'd never been there before,

610
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,935
and you still had
the remnants of communism.

611
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,738
I had to stand in line
to buy coupons for gas.

612
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,340
And, you know, you go there now,
and it's this vibrant--

613
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,276
both countries, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia--

614
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,144
they're vibrant,
beautiful countries.

615
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:26,079
We sort of trace
in the permanent gallery

616
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,715
this journey-- immigration
to freedom and democracy.

617
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,551
We want to tell
the American story,

618
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,653
the Czech story,
and the Slovak story.

619
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,655
- John: Similar stories,
similar cultures,

620
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:35,989
the Czechs and Slovaks?

621
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:37,157
- Cecilia: They're
complementary.

622
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:38,325
- John: Complementary.

623
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,626
- Cecilia: They have
differences,

624
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,895
but I would say the language
is probably 80% the same.

625
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:43,063
- John: Okay.

626
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,665
- Cecilia: But they are
two separate countries.

627
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:47,768
We are so proud to be
both a Czech and Slovak museum

628
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,803
because we capture
their stories.

629
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,238
- This place is huge.

630
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:54,975
It's a very impressive structure
that you have this museum in,

631
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,777
and then you told me
as we walked over,

632
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:58,612
"You know, it was moved."
- Yes.

633
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,480
- Because of
the flood of 2008.

634
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,648
- Correct.

635
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,650
- John: So this building
was moved inch by inch.

636
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,486
- Cecilia: Across the road
and turned around

637
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,121
and doubled in size, though.

638
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:12,793
So it was a very big disaster,
but it's turned into a blessing

639
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,495
in terms of our impact
and what we're able to do.

640
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,831
- John: Because I,
as an Irish American,

641
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,867
can walk through
this museum and find

642
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,835
similarities
in experience, can't I?

643
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,170
- Yeah, that's exactly--

644
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,772
You've hit the nail on the head,
what we want people to do.

645
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,441
And we have about 5,000 students

646
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,409
that come through our museum
every year,

647
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,812
and we say to them,
"What's your nationality?"

648
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,047
They'll say, you know,
"Mexican," "German,"

649
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,650
"Norwegian," and we say,
"Okay, today, you're gonna learn

650
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:39,753
"the Czech and Slovak story,
and go home and ask Mom or Dad

651
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,589
or Grandma or Grandpa
what's their story."

652
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:46,026
And those stories are the ones
that really define the future

653
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,495
because from those stories,
we can teach future generations

654
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,197
what our ancestors went through.

655
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,865
- John: Yeah.

656
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,867
- You don't ever have
to worry about the weather

657
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,936
when you come here
because their skywalk system

658
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:58,338
connects 15 city blocks,

659
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:02,376
so why am I not
in the skywalk filming this?

660
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,011
I don't know.

661
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,746
[upbeat music]

662
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,282
You know, the people
from <i>American Gothic,</i>

663
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:10,083
they didn't look like
they were having much fun,

664
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,685
but we sure did.
- We had fun.

665
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,487
- We did.
- One of my favorite days.

666
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:14,888
You know, the smells
of this town,

667
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,157
I love the day that it smelled
like Crunch Berries,

668
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:18,792
my favorite cereal.
- Yum!

669
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,395
- God, can you imagine living
in a town that smells like this?

670
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,563
- I love cereal.

671
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,565
We just need some milk.
- Get your own, lady.

672
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,967
- I have a pitchfork,
and I know how to use it.

673
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,135
- Arr rowr rowr rowr!

674
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,571
? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

675
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:35,309
? The heart and soul
of community's right here ?

676
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,510
- Can I do it over?

677
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:37,911
My hair's, like,
flying in my face.

678
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,313
I'm sorry, I was like--
I was--

679
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,915
- The west side of De Pere
is a great place to live.

680
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,584
De Pere?
[laughs]

681
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,054
This is the funniest government
building I've ever seen.

682
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,789
- We sure did.
- We did.

683
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,058
- Oh, that's scared--
"We did."

684
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,226
- Did you see her?

685
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,760
She went--
[all laughing]

686
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,063
Nobody really said,
"Good job, John."

687
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,898
[crew laughing]

688
00:24:57,965 --> 00:24:59,633
- Why am I here?

689
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:01,602
- We gotta be done, I think.

690
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,904
- Lois Mauer: I think so.

691
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,108
- Announcer:
We thank the underwriters

692
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,610
of <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets,</i>

693
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,946
because without them,
we couldn't make this show.

694
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,716
- My father taught me
that to make great bakery,

695
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,351
you have to do it the right way.

696
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:22,322
O&H Danish Bakery,
where kringle traditions begin.

697
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:27,194
- Yes, Greendale
is beautiful on the outside,

698
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:30,764
but it's what's inside
that counts.

699
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:34,635
Who doesn't love opening a door
to great food?

700
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,704
Whether you want to go casual...

701
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:40,774
upscale...

702
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:46,680
or maybe you want to try
something brand-new!

703
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,215
Come on in!

704
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:51,084
You just gotta see Greendale.

705
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,120
- Visit Oconomowoc.

706
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,289
Lakes, festivals,
shopping, dining.

707
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,124
The heart of Lake Country.

708
00:25:57,191 --> 00:26:01,795
- Your community's best
selfie spot is Your-Type!

709
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,797
- The Wisconsin Northwoods
are calling.

710
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,834
One word, one place: Minocqua.

711
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,903
- There's always something
shining bright

712
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,539
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

713
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,442
- Announcer: <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i> is grateful

714
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,946
for additional financial
support from

715
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:22,516
Horicon Bank:

716
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,320
West Bend Insurance Company:
The Silver Lining,

717
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:30,190
our nonprofit,
the Friends of Main Streets,

718
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:34,127
and from the Friends
of PBS Wisconsin.

719
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:36,430
Thanks, underwriters!

720
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,966
- Lois: I don't know
if I've ever seen a cleaner--

721
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,567
- I'm not really sure
I liked it.

722
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:41,969
I think I should try
another one.

723
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:44,238
- Lois: I think so.
[laughs]

724
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:46,540
- John: That was so good.
