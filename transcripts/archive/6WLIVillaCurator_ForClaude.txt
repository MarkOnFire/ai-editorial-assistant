1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,010
I love learning about art.

2
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,546
I love talking to artists.

3
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,251
Curatorial is amazing

4
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,386
and it is privilege
to be in these roles.

5
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,320
And...

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,822
I just love working
with artists.

7
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,557
It brings me joy.

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,561
This place is special.

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,830
It's like a gem of
historic relevance

10
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,732
that I think people
often overlook.

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,469
And it holds a lot of
Milwaukee history.

12
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,073
The Allis is very historic,

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,575
whereas the Villa,

14
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,810
creme de la creme
is essentially the view.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,779
And then finding artwork
that kind of responds

16
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,750
to the natural environment
of the museum.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,952
And I think it's important
to keep telling these stories

18
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,187
and hold these stories.

19
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,222
So Milwaukeeans in the future
are able to learn about

20
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,858
where we came from
as a city.
