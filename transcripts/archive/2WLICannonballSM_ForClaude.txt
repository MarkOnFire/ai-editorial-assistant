[motorcycle rumbling]

- Jonas Zahn:
This year's Virginia Beach
to Oceanside, California.

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,353
The riders are
from all over the world.

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,522
- Cannonball is one
of the most difficult

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,726
antique motorcycle endurance
races on the planet.

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:31,098
- Jonas Zahn:
This is a 1928 Moto Guzzi
Sport 14 with a sidecar

9
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,402
that is known for
reliability and endurance.

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,871
- Jonas is preparing
this vintage bike

11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,542
for a 3,800-mile
coast-to-coast race

12
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,211
that zigzags
across America.

13
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,246
- Jonas: I imported it
from Verona, Italy,

14
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,348
just for Motorcycle Cannonball,

15
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,517
so it's a pretty special
motorcycle sitting here.

16
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,752
? ?

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,756
- For Jonas, motorcycles
are a family tradition.

18
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,759
- I discovered motorcycles
through my grandfather

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,229
in looking at his old
black-and-white photo album.

20
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:06,433
As a young farm kid, I was
always fascinated with machines.

[tool clinks]

22
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,504
- As an adult,
he still has a fascination

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,340
with fixing and restoring
classic bikes

24
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,876
here at
Peg Leg Speed Shop.

25
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,312

an amputee

26
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,947
from a motorcycle accident
24 years ago,

I got a second chance <i>at life,</i>

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,427
I'm also
not doing this alone.

31
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,231
Brenda is
an amazing woman.

32
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,433
She's a biker at heart.

33
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,871
- Brenda Kuhl and Jonas
share a biker bond.

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,440
- Brenda Kuhl: I love Jonas
like he's a brother to me,

35
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,976
and I love
that he chose me.

36
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,880
- Brenda said,
"I'll ride in a sidecar."

37
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,615
"Really? Okay.

38
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,517
Well, then,
you can navigate."

39
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,753
- At my age, I thought,
"This is an opportunity for me

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,423
to experience
a cross-country trip,

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,128
whether it's a little bit scary
or whether it's a lot of fun."

42
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,930
- Two heads
are better than one,

43
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,765
so I'm glad
she's on board.

[garage door opening]

45
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,405
- Team 36 has been working
for more than a year

46
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,375
to get the Moto Guzzi
race-ready.

[ringing bell,

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,078
- Jonas: I have ridden antiques,

49
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,848
and I have done
cross-country touring,

50
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,550
but I have not
combined them together.

51
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,619
And it has been
more than 20 years

52
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,621
since I rode a motorcycle
across the Wisconsin state line.

[motorcycle engine chugs]

54
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,663
- Race day arrived
with a lot of anticipation.

55
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,566
- Day one of Cannonball,
we rode to the starting place.

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,734
There's this great big statue
in Virginia Beach.

[motors rumble]

58
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,304
The average speed
for most of us

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,306
will be about
35 miles an hour.

60
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,708
It's not about
going fast.

61
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,945
You experience
the smells of the countryside.

62
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,448
That is just so awesome.
[slaps leg]

63
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,749
I'm looking forward
to that.

64
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,585
It's emotional
for me.

[engine rattles]

66
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,355
It's exploring,
and it's exciting.

67
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,324
It puts life into me.

68
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,459
[cheers]

69
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,328
- Both Jonas and Brenda
are ready

70
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,864
for the ride
of a lifetime.

71
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,867
? ?

72
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,237
- Keeping a motorcycle that's
almost a hundred years old,

73
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:28,242
operating every day, all day,
that is the challenge.

74
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,444
<i>- Challenging</i> would be
an understatement

75
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,647
for what Team 36
would encounter.

76
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,317
- Brenda:
Getting on the road and seeing
bikes already breaking down

77
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,653
was a little scary
and unnerving.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,756
- Jonas: Keep in mind, even
the best-laid plans can just...

Whoop!
Out the window, right?

80
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,226
- Jonas just looked at me,
he said,

81
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,862
"The bike
is running great."

82
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,532
- We're going faster;
it's getting more horsepower.

83
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,766
- In an instant...

84
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,434
[pop]

85
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,236
that all changed.

[sad music]

87
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,608
- All of a sudden,
this big, huge pop happened.

88
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,210
- We got another five miles
down the road,

89
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,045
and it just went...
whoosh!

90
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,781
Perfectly quiet, dead silent,
coasted to a stop

91
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:12,186
in the beautiful
North Carolina countryside.

92
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,955
- One hundred miles
into the race,

93
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,424
the motorbike
they nicknamed "Renata,

94
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,494
the goddess of rebirth
and adventure" in Italian

95
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,396
broke down.

96
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,365
- Brenda's like, "Just fix it,
please, just fix it."

97
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,870
I saw the valve was
actually broken in two pieces.

98
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,939
We had a thousand hours
of mechanic time.

99
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,941
I had 750 miles
of practice rides.

100
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,209
It still broke down

101
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,311
in a way that
we weren't going to come back.

102
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,615
Made the decision
to abandon the Moto Guzzi.

103
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:45,552
- In that very moment,
Jonas forged his own comeback

104
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,155
at a nearby
vintage motorcycle museum.

105
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,823
[gentle banjo]

106
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,228
- Jonas: It turns out he had
a 1937 Harley-Davidson.

107
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,831
[speaking with great emotion]
That's the bike
that made me fall in love...

108
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,132
with motorcycling.

109
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,901
And there it is.

110
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,736
And it's just like Grandpa's.
[laughs warmly]

111
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,607
- Team 36 named the new bike
"Salvatore."

112
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,278
In Italian,
that translates to "savior."

113
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,947
Jonas had found
his salvation.

114
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,483
- Jonas: I knew that it was
not going to be good for Brenda,

115
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,719
and I felt bad
about that.

116
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,855
- For Brenda, it would mean
the end of the road.

117
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:25,192
- I started to cry.
- Jonas: In the rain.
<i>- Brenda: In the rain.</i>

118
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,495
And having a moment
to myself, thinking,

119
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,531
"I really didn't
want it to end."

120
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,935
[choking up]
It looks like I just took
my last thing off of Renata.

121
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,337
She's staying behind.

122
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,773
She's not going to make
Motorcycle Cannonball.

123
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,642
- Those tears
would turn to triumph

124
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,411
and her own shot
at redemption.

125
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,081
- Brenda: You don't ever want
to wait for the opportunity

126
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,584
to present itself
again.

127
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,419
I flew
back to Wisconsin,

128
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,121
got home
at quarter to twelve at night,

129
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,590
loaded my bike
by six in the morning.

130
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,358
[motor rumbling]

131
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:03,263
Drove cross-country back
to Cape Girardeau on my Harley.

132
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,434
- Brenda would go on to complete
the race route on her Harley.

133
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,203
[cheers and applause]

134
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,171
- Brenda:
I videotaped you coming in.

135
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,607
- Here comes Jonas!
- Group: Whoo!

136
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,010
- Jonas crossed the finish line
on his new vintage Hog.

137
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,745
- Yeah, Jonas!

138
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,948
[cheers and applause]

139
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,685
- Brenda: We were all
a little bit emotional.

140
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,486
Just giving him
a big hug,

141
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,323
and it's nothing for Jonas
to always give me a hug

142
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,991
and tell me, you know,

143
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,493
how proud he is of me anyway.
[Jonas chuckles]

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,829
[music, engine humming]

145
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,833
- Jonas: We wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't fun.

146
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,503
I don't understand why everybody
doesn't want to do this.

147
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,238
[motor putting]

148
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:50,143
- As for Renata,
she is set for her own revival

149
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,613
and a shot
at a comeback.

150
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,682
- I will also do Cannonball
again on this same Moto Guzzi.

151
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,917
We're gonna
give it a shot.
