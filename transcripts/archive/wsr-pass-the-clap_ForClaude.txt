00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,142
- Dawry: Here's how you play
Pass the Clap.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,145
Has anyone heard
of Pass the Clap before?

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,083
Well, it's a game about being
in tune with each other.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,484
Now, to start,

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,987
you're gonna wanna look
at the person next to you,

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,857
either with eye contact
or at their hands.

8
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,793
And to pass the clap, you're
gonna clap at the same time.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,530
Like this.
[hands clapping]

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,832
Oh, that's okay.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,267
Keep going.

12
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,002
[hands clapping]

13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,782
Let's see if we can do it
a little bit faster.

14
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,318
[hands clapping quickly]

15
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,689
If you think your class
can beat our time,

16
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,957
record yourselves every week

17
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,759
and see if you can get
a faster time

18
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,327
all the way around the circle.

19
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,430
That's how you play
Pass the Clap.
