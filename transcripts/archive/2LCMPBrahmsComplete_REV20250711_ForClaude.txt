00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,441
- Rachel Barton Pine:
I think for the audience

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,276
to truly appreciate
this concerto,

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,444
it's not just a question

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,480
of giving all of your attention
to me

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,649
with the orchestra
in a supportive role,

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,652
because it is such a partnership

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,089
between my part
and everybody else's part.

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,658
I think if you just take in
the big picture

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,793
and listen for all the music
that's happening

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,695
all around the stage,
with of course,

11
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,431
the solo violin
being at the forefront,

12
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,267
but almost more as a tour guide

13
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,703
than as, you know,
just the main event.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,207
And so, you're gonna really get
a rich tapestry

15
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,509
of colors and textures,

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:47,981
and there's something
very transporting about that.
