15
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,408

questions 'til the end.

16
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,143
So, I'm really excited

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,445

40
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,395
[audience applauding]

41
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,165
Thank you so much,
thank you.

42
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,039
- Tony Chambers: So, welcome.

43
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,844
I, like most of my colleagues,
like to start any conversation,

44
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:55,148
collective conversation we have,
with what we call a practice.

45
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,417
My colleague Richie Davidson

46
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,887
likes to call it
clearing the lens.

47
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,856
I don't know what that means,
but he uses that all the time,

48
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,358
so I'm gonna use it, too.

49
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,959
We're gonna clear the lens
for a minute.

50
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:09,296
So, for those
who feel comfortable enough,

51
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:13,567
I'd like to invite you
to just find a relaxed space,

52
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,302
if you would.

53
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,071
We usually tell our students
to close all of your computers

54
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,707
and turn your phone off
for a minute.

55
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,278
If you could just find a space
that's comfortable for you.

56
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,547
I invite you,
if you want to close your eyes,

57
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,814
feel free to do so.

58
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,416
If you don't want to close
your eyes

59
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,252
or if you don't even
want to participate in this,

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,790
if you could just, you know,
gaze at something straight ahead

61
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:41,161
and just find a peaceful
and quiet place for yourself.

62
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,898
So, I'd like to take
a couple of minutes.

63
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,804
You know, belonging has never
been more important

64
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,108
in the world in which we live.

65
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,879
The pandemic taught us so much.

66
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:02,416
Many of us today,
this week, this year,

67
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,588
have been pushed into
thinking about where we belong,

68
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,558
if we belong, and in some cases,
why we belong.

69
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,861
So our discussion today

70
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,765
is on everybody's mind
in one way or another.

71
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,605
The Zulu people
in the southern part of Africa,

72
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,042
when they encounter somebody,
they greet them with this,

73
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,777
this really interesting
greeting.

74
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,181
They say, "Sawubona,"
"Sawubona,"

75
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,754
which means, "I see you."

76
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,260
And the response is, "Sikhona,"

77
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,099
which means
"I am here to be seen."

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,269
"I see you."

79
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,638
"I am here to be seen."

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,076
That's the essence
of belonging:

81
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:07,714
to be seen and to be present
to receive the seeing.

82
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,523
I'd like for us
to think about that

83
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,496
when we encounter one another,
when we encounter our students,

84
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:27,568
when we encounter our families,
neighbors, friends.

85
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,238
And most of all,

86
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,475
I'd like for us to hold that
and think about that

87
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:40,013
when we encounter those
who we think are others,

88
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,951
who are not others,

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,088
who are us.

90
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,891
Sawubona, Sikhona.

91
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,598
Thank you all.

92
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:05,305
Now, thank you for indulging me
with that for a minute.

93
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,547
Flourishing in a culture
of belonging, right?

94
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,752
By the way, if you want to know
how to spell that,

95
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,721
because there it is.

96
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,225
Okay.

97
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:30,030
So, let me continue
with what I started with.

98
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,435
The notion of belonging
has shown up everywhere.

99
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,739
In fact, it's the buzzword
of this last

100
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,341
five, six, seven,
nine, ten years.

101
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,478
People have embraced the concept
from a political perspective.

102
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,879
They've embraced it

103
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,916
from an emotional-psychological
perspective.

104
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,986
We've evolved a cottage industry
of researchers,

105
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,322
researchers and others,

106
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,826
who have tried to understand
what that means

107
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,797
and what are the implications
of belonging or not belonging.

108
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,533
I'll mention in a little while

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,204
the Surgeon General
Vivek Murthy's recent report,

110
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,106
2023 report,
on the epidemic of loneliness,

111
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,477
which is related
to the concept of belonging.

112
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,882
So, belonging is part
of our current

113
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,750
and probably our future lexicon.

114
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,319
So we'll be talking about this

115
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,021
or at least trying
to make sense of it

116
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,758
for the next decades,
maybe centuries.

117
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,832
And I will tell you that
every conflict in our world,

118
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,135
whether it's on a personal level

119
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,772
or whether it's
on a geo-global level,

120
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,477
is related to the concept
of belonging.

121
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,882
It's either those of us
who are seeking to belong

122
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,950
with and to something

123
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,725
or those of us who are trying to
restrict others from belonging.

124
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,327
So, we are looking for it,

125
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,932
or we're trying to restrict
others from belonging.

126
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,102
And that is the center
of all of our conflicts.

127
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,539
It's also the center
of most of our human joy

128
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,141
and human flourishing around us

129
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,578
because what we understand
about belonging

130
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:29,416
is that it has significant
psychological, emotional,

131
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,053
behavioral,
physical implications,

132
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,889
positive implications
when one belongs.

133
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,693
And we're gonna get into that
in a little bit.

134
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,728
So, we know that it's
the center of conflict.

135
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:46,099
We know that it is at the
foundation of most of our joy

136
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,635
and most of our flourishing.

137
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,072
Let me start by sharing
with you something

138
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,274
that we do
at the Center for Healthy Minds.

139
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,443
Just for my entertainment,

140
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,681
how many of you know about
the Center for Healthy Minds?

141
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,416
Good.

142
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,351
Good.

143
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,887
It's an interesting place
to work.

144
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,890
It's interesting things
that we do there.

145
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,593
But for those who don't know,
the Center for Healthy Minds

146
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,897
is a research center at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison

147
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:22,135
that is a center that
explores the brain, basically,

148
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,671
and what happens in the brain
when people engage

149
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:28,509
in certain types
of behavior that changes,

150
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,943
you know,
pretty much your physical,

151
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,312
mental, and emotional health.

152
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,515
So, we explore what goes on
in the brain,

153
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,083
particularly
when it comes to things

154
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,318
like contemplative practice.

155
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,288
We want to know what happens
in the brains of people

156
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,190
that have
certain kind of maladies

157
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,158
like Alzheimer's disease,
asthma,

158
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,060
and these kind of things.

159
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,430
And what we try to do
is try to work with those folks

160
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,466
who are in those communities,

161
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,036
health care professionals
and others, teachers,

162
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,572
to try to elevate these things
and help people

163
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,843
that they work with
develop better lives.

164
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,180
That's shorthand
for, I think, what we do.

165
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,749
And Richard Davidson, who
some of you all may know,

166
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,484
neuroscientist,

167
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,888
and he likes to say,
friend of the Dalai Lama.

168
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,492
I've never met the Dalai Lama,
so I can't verify any of that.

169
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,161
So let's assume it's true.

170
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,896
And he leads,

171
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:27,734
he tells us that we want
to reduce suffering in the world

172
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,138
by the scientific study
of the mind.

173
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,606
And that's pretty much
what we do.

174
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,008
We also do
quite a bit of outreach.

175
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,912
One of the things that we do
and started doing is teaching.

176
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:43,183
We have an initiative called the
Human Flourishing Initiative.

177
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,353
It's actually called the Art and
Science of Human Flourishing.

178
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,956
And one of the things
we do in that initiative

179
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,025
is we teach
undergraduate students.

180
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,996
This semester, we have 360
of them in one class.

181
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:59,333
We teach them about some
of the components

182
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,271
of a flourishing life,
of which these are some of them.

183
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:08,408
And we have this model
that's both the research model

184
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:13,046
as well as a model that guides
us through our teaching.

185
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,449
And the model is awareness,

186
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,051
connection, insight,
and purpose.

187
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,954
We changed it to integration,
but purpose.

188
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,491
And in the 15-week class,
we explore these,

189
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:29,096
this model and have
these related components,

190
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,933
related themes for each
of the class periods.

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,936
And the class period
that we're on this week,

192
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:41,108
surprisingly enough,
serendipitously, is belonging.

193
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:44,711
So I was able to engage
our 360 students this week,

194
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:48,415
Monday and Wednesday,
around the topic of belonging.

195
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,651
Monday, Wednesday
and Thursday, actually,

196
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,187
on the topic of belonging.

197
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,557
And what I want to share
with you all today

198
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,660
are some of the lessons
I've learned from my students,

199
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,461
as well as some of the lessons

200
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,798
that I've learned through this
Badger Talk experience,

201
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:08,635
of which I've been able to go
around the state of Wisconsin.

202
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,238
I've been able to experience,
to explore the concept

203
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,607
of belonging with folks
at different universities

204
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,576
across the country.

205
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,546
And I didn't know
I was doing this,

206
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,282
but I was exploring
the concept of belonging

207
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,153
in previous life experiences,
which I think are quite relevant

208
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,388
and illuminates
my understanding,

209
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,725
and hopefully will be of value
to you all,

210
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,994
my understanding
about the concept of belonging.

211
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:39,199
So, that's all preface to say
I'm a curious human being.

212
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,768
I think I've learned some stuff.

213
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,905
I'm quite open to learning
more stuff from other folks

214
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,407
anywhere about this concept
of belonging

215
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,209
because I think at some point,
it's the center

216
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,946
of most of where we're at
right now as a world,

217
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,016
certainly as a nation, right,

218
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,819
and as a community
here in Madison.

219
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,554
So, all preface.

220
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,123
Got me going.

221
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,559
This is what I do in class

222
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,594
because I know
first-year students,

223
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,596
and I'm not saying, you all,
I'm equating this group

224
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:10,797
with first-year students,
but I understand

225
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,199
first-year students.

226
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,468
They wannna know, "Well,
what are you gonna tell us

227
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,803
that's gonna be on the test?"
[audience laughing]

228
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,205
Right,
"What are you gonna,

229
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,340
What am I supposed
to pay attention to?"

230
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,177
So I start 'em off by telling
'em what to pay attention to.

231
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,514
And then I tell them throughout
my conversations with them

232
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,349
what all of this stuff means.

233
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,351
So, let me go through
a couple of these things.

234
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,987
These are the takeaways
for today.

235
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:39,993
We're primarily focusing
on social and public belonging.

236
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,428
There are other types
of belonging,

237
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:47,301
but we're only focusing on the
social and the public belonging.

238
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:52,105
Belonging impacts well-being
psychologically, emotionally,

239
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:56,109
physically, socially,
and pretty much every other way

240
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,812
where there are relationships.

241
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,281
Belonging,
and this is important, people,

242
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,184
because we've conflated
the concept of DEI

243
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,953
with the concept of belonging.

244
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,490
Belonging is not diversity,
equity, and inclusion.

245
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,430
I'll let that settle in
for a minute.

246
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,733
And belonging is not consistent

247
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,036
across all human beings
all the time

248
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,907
or even the same human being
all the time.

249
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,076
Here's another one.

250
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:34,381
Belonging is not always
or not necessarily a good thing.

251
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,154
Belonging does not mean
fitting in à la Brené Brown.

252
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,327
Experiencing belonging

253
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,964
is not the same
as a sense of belonging.

254
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,768
A sense of belonging
is an affect.

255
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,638
It's a feeling, it's an emotion.

256
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,508
Experiencing belonging
is behavioral.

257
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,045
And those two are not always
the same thing.

258
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,281
Not that they're
mutually exclusive,

259
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,417
but they're not the same thing.

260
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,587
Now, here's the one that my
students struggle with the most

261
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,756
and the biggest lesson
I've ever learned.

262
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:19,626
And it's the simplest lesson
I've ever learned.

263
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:25,599
That to which you want to belong
has to want you to belong to it.

264
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:33,373
That to which you want to belong
has to want you to belong to it.

265
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,411
It's not enough to say,
"I want to belong."

266
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,913
It's not enough
for us to tell our students

267
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,715
and our colleagues
and ourselves,

268
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:45,185
"You belong,
therefore, you belong."

269
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:51,725
That to which you want to belong
has to want you to belong to it.

270
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,394
And as I mentioned before,

271
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:58,966
belonging is at the center
of all human conflicts and joys.

272
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,535
If you don't hear anything else
I have to say

273
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:05,873
for the rest of the minutes
I'm standing here, this is it.

274
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,608
This is it, folks.

275
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,811
I don't know if I have any
much more to tell you.

276
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,813
But let's try to make
some sense out of this.

277
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,981
Everybody has seen this thing.

278
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,817
This is Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

279
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:20,687
And Maslow pretty much tells us
that we all, as human beings,

280
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,625
have these basic needs
on this system, right?

281
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,427
And he identifies
belonging and love

282
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,497
as positioned right
between self-esteem

283
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,932
and safety and security.

284
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:35,002
It is three steps
above or below,

285
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,171
depending on how
you look at it,

286
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,840
above the need
for safety and security

287
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,909
and physiological needs.

288
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,744
We need these things
as human beings.

289
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,649
In fact, Maslow would tell us
is that it's baked into our DNA.

290
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:52,052
We are born with these needs,
right?

291
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:56,089
I'm gonna contest that at some
point in this conversation,

292
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,359
or at least I'm gonna give
a little bit of nuance to it

293
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,794
as we go forward,

294
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:04,932
but belonging is
super important as human beings

295
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,467
in our structure of needs.

296
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,037
Now, I mentioned earlier

297
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,305
there are different types
of belonging,

298
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,140
and I'm not gonna go
through all of these,

299
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,344
but belonging, at least
according to Joe Myers

300
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,813
in his book
<i>The Search to Belong,</i>

301
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,817
identifies four areas,
four types of belonging

302
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,086
that each of us experience
at some point in time

303
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:30,591
and some of us experience
at the same time, right,

304
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,493
with the same people, right?

305
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,928
So, there's
the intimate belonging,

306
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,730
which hopefully all of us
have experienced,

307
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,799
and that's usually
with a loved one or somebody

308
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:42,870
that's really close to us,
or a best friend.

309
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,373
And we share things
and we expect things

310
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,275
and we live in relationship
with them in ways

311
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,544
that we don't live in
relationships with anybody else.

312
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:55,282
It is the closest relationship
we can have, right?

313
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,952
Then there's
this personal belonging,

314
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,623
which is the next level,
with friends and families,

315
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,425
and we have
this mutual relationship

316
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,160
of disclosing information.

317
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,663
And we assume
a high level of trust.

318
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,201
Trust is critical
in a belonging relationship.

319
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,069
Then there's the social.

320
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,438
And I did mention
that most of the conversation

321
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,607
and most of the exploration
around belonging

322
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:23,544
is centered
around social and public.

323
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,612
And sometimes they overlap.

324
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,084
But the social belonging is when
we experience people that we,

325
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:36,290
whom we recognize, but we
may not know very well, right?

326
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,458
It helps us develop
our sense of identity

327
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,661
and sense of who we are.

328
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:46,333
And social belongings,
we often self-select ourself.

329
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,669
We put ourselves in there
by selection.

330
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,170
We're not chosen sometimes.

331
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:54,107
We self-select into these
belonging relationships

332
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,343
with those with whom we have

333
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,745
personal or even
intimate belonging.

334
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,948
So, it could overlap
with the intimate

335
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,283
as well as the personal
belonging category.

336
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,885
Then there's
this public belonging,

337
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:09,590
which most of us associate
with being members of a city,

338
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:13,727
being members of an institution
that has a mascot.

339
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,263
For example, I am a Badger.

340
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:22,169
That is my public belonging
or my need for public belonging.

341
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,571
I am a Madisonian, right?

342
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,241
This is public belonging.

343
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,410
We associate
and connect ourselves

344
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,312
with people in a broader sense.

345
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,647
We don't know 'em well,

346
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:37,918
but we have this external
commonality, right?

347
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,353
So, most of the conversation

348
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,988
and most of the work
that's been done

349
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:44,591
is around the public and the
social concept of belonging.

350
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:46,326
Okay, real quick.

351
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,429
These are some
of the potential impacts

352
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,633
of related concepts
or related experience:

353
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:57,037
isolation, loneliness, as well
as the concept of not belonging.

354
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:58,205
Right?

355
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,174
We know that you all,

356
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:04,011
as well as the students
with whom you work with,

357
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,914
if they feel isolated
or if they feel lonely

358
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,883
or feel like they don't belong,

359
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,953
their performance,
their persistence,

360
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,422
as well as their level
of engagement

361
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,191
with the important things
that contribute

362
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:21,728
to their academic success
are impacted, right?

363
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:26,233
If they don't experience
belonging

364
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,769
in the places
that are important,

365
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,904
in these institutions,

366
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,974
then their performance,
their very existence,

367
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,711
their success
is impacted negatively.

368
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,214
Now, this one
I found really interesting,

369
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,150
is that, as far
as the neuroscience of it all,

370
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,751
when you have a sense
of belonging

371
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,553
or not a sense of belonging,

372
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,989
it elicits
within your neurotransmitters

373
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,558
the same kind of cravings

374
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:56,697
that are strong when it comes
to hunger and thirst.

375
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,732
So, we know that there are
parts of your brain

376
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,804
that are triggered
when you're hungry and thirsty.

377
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,806
And those transmitters
and that experience

378
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:10,777
is quite the same thing as
when you're isolated and lonely.

379
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:14,081
In fact,
much of what we understand

380
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,717
is that the pain receptors
in your body,

381
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,452
the things that elicit pain,

382
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,089
that tell you
you're hurting physically,

383
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,392
are the same kind of things
that you experience

384
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:28,462
when you feel isolated
and lonely.

385
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:32,165
So, isolation, loneliness,
not belonging,

386
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,067
your brain can't distinguish

387
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:38,405
between that and the physical
pain that we go through.

388
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:41,141
So imagine your students,
right,

389
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:45,045
when they feel like they don't
belong or they don't belong.

390
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:47,247
They're experiencing
the same kind of experience

391
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:50,117
as if you punched them
in the face.

392
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,919
Right, or if they were punched
in the face.

393
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,520
Not that you punched them
in the face.

394
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,422
[all laughing]

395
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,024
So please don't go out here
thinking

396
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,193
you're gonna do an experiment,
punch 'em in the face.

397
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,360
Leave 'em alone, okay?

398
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,162
Not the same thing.

399
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,199
We also know
that for those who feel lonely

400
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,936
and not like they belong,
is that they make,

401
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,737
they're a little bit more
pessimistic.

402
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,807
They don't see
the glass half full.

403
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:18,779
They see the glass not only half
empty, but almost totally empty.

404
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:20,848
We know this to be true.

405
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:25,319
They're less trusting
of other people, right?

406
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,455
And they contribute,
and this lack of belonging

407
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:31,491
contributes to some
of the cognitive difficulties

408
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:32,693
they may not have.

409
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,294
They may not have
as strong a memory,

410
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,463
or we may not have
as strong a memories.

411
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,931
Right?

412
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,467
We may not be able
to process information

413
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:44,037
quite the same way
as it's being delivered.

414
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:47,207
We know that sometimes
information goes in.

415
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:52,279
It's misinterpreted in ways that
would not normally be that way

416
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:56,016
if we belonged or if we didn't
feel like we were isolated

417
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,986
or if loneliness wasn't
the central characteristic

418
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,621
of our being,

419
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,856
we'd be able
to receive information,

420
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,892
process information,
make meaning of it,

421
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,693
and apply it in the lives
that we live

422
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,064
in more positive ways
than we would otherwise.

423
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:15,502
So, belonging
and loneliness and isolation

424
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:20,474
are not only these subjective
feelings that we have.

425
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:24,878
They actually impact
how we live a life,

426
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:29,183
a flourishing life,
a full life, a life at all.

427
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,719
And we know
that it can impact mental,

428
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:36,356
physical, and emotional
well-being.

429
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,359
Now, the Surgeon General's--

430
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,628
and these are some
of the research projects

431
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,530
that some of my colleagues
have been involved in,

432
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:46,400
as well as some of the projects

433
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,303
that we're trying to explore
right now

434
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,573
relative
to the effects of isolation

435
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,542
and loneliness and belonging.

436
00:22:56,043 --> 00:23:00,814
Central to this is Vivek Murthy,
the Surgeon General's report

437
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,450
that was issued back in 2023

438
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:06,220
that outlines
some of the effects

439
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:08,856
of this epidemic of loneliness
that he talks about,

440
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:13,861
which is, again, related
to belonging or not belonging.

441
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,028
Right?

442
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,297
And what he tells us
is the population

443
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:20,601
that's most at risk
for loneliness

444
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,570
is older people, seniors.

445
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:27,474
Right?

446
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,776
Second are young women,

447
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,917
school-age, college-age women
and younger.

448
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,186
Right?

449
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:44,057
The third population that's most
at risk for loneliness

450
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:47,861
are college-age students,
generally,

451
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,830
from the 18 to the 26.

452
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,968
Now, it probably applies
even beyond that, for sure,

453
00:23:55,035 --> 00:24:00,007
but those are the populations
that many of us engage who,

454
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:01,742
or many of us are.

455
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,546
Right?

456
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,881
So, we know that this
epidemic of loneliness

457
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,284
is not only concentrated

458
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,086
amongst people who have
physical, mental,

459
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,556
and psychological
and emotional challenges,

460
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,391
which is true,

461
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,260
but it has an impact on almost
every one of our lives.

462
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:22,496
And if we ourselves
aren't experiencing this,

463
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:25,899
we know somebody
who is experiencing

464
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:31,338
this epidemic of loneliness,
not belonging, or isolation.

465
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:35,242
And it has serious ramifications
on themselves

466
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,979
as well as those of us
who care about 'em.

467
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,583
As far as the health,

468
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:46,053
how social disconnection
or social connection works,

469
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,990
and this is a graphic from
the Surgeon General's report.

470
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,227
And this is basically a road map

471
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:56,663
as to how social connection
or a lack of social connection

472
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,333
impacts our health outcomes.

473
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,036
Social connection
or lack of social connection

474
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:05,005
impacts our biology

475
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,408
in terms of our stress hormones
and inflammation,

476
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:10,010
which is, some would argue,

477
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:14,348
the center of most
of our physical maladies, right?

478
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:16,083
Our psychology,

479
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,953
which is our attempt
to find meaning and purpose

480
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,722
in the world we live in.

481
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:25,325
Stress, which, again,
much like inflammation,

482
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:29,396
is at the center of most
of our challenges.

483
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:34,635
Or use stress, or what we call
good stress versus distress,

484
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,438
which is the kind of stress
that's long term

485
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,240
and has a deeper impact

486
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:44,044
on almost every part
of our well-being.

487
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,512
And our behavior,

488
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,916
our physical activities,
the choices we make,

489
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,618
our sleeping pattern,
the kind of activities

490
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:55,122
we engage in
that are self-harmful.

491
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:58,392
I guess one could say it
that way.

492
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,361
So, the lack
of social connection

493
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:04,398
or the existence
of social connection

494
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:08,035
impacts our bodies and our minds
in all kinds of ways,

495
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,736
which lead to all kinds
of social outcomes.

496
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,772
And I will say,
and it's not in here,

497
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,141
but I will say there are
certain populations

498
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,845
that are affected much more
by this dynamic

499
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,146
than other populations.

500
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,248
We know for a fact,
and of course,

501
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,716
the Surgeon General
identified this,

502
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,718
but we know this to be
true anyway,

503
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,654
that women, people of color,

504
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:30,791
folks in the
LGBTQ+ community,

505
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:34,061
those with certain types
of disabilities,

506
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:37,364
some folks from specific
international places,

507
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,567
struggle more
with concepts of isolation,

508
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:43,904
loneliness,
and the lack of belonging,

509
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:48,108
much more so
than other populations, right?

510
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:52,613
And the data for
disproportionate health outcomes

511
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,816
or disparate health outcomes
reflect that.

512
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:59,319
And for those of you all
in the health care professions,

513
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:04,124
you could probably verify this
in all kinds of ways, right?

514
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:09,129
These populations are
experiencing outrageous impacts

515
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,864
on their health and well-being.

516
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:13,800
And what exposed
this whole thing was, you know,

517
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,771
what happened during the
pandemic across the board.

518
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,640
And it continues on.

519
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,445
So, let me shift gears
for a quick second.

520
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:28,849
What are some of the dimensions?

521
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,284
Well, first of all,
let me ask,

522
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,788
how many of you ever had
an experience of belonging?

523
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,523
Hands raised.

524
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,560
Do that again.

525
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:45,999
Okay, how many of you
ever experienced not belonging?

526
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:51,038
How many of you have
ever had experience

527
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:55,008
of belonging
and you didn't wanna belong?

528
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,512
I know that's confusing.

529
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:02,850
How about, have you ever had
an experience of not belonging

530
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,253
when you actually
did wanna belong?

531
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,991
Can you do that last one again?

532
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,560
Not belonging and you really
wanted to belong?

533
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:16,897
Okay, there are a few of you
who never had that experience.

534
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:20,267
That's telling, I'm impressed.

535
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,637
So, what does all that mean,
right?

536
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,005
When we talk about belonging,

537
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:28,809
and much of the research
that exposes us to belonging,

538
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,178
we tend to think of it
in subjective terms.

539
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:33,547
It's a feeling, it's a sense.

540
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:36,783
In fact, we use language
like "a sense of belonging."

541
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,786
I did this review of how
belonging is referred to

542
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,755
in much of the literature,
as well as in

543
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,992
post-secondary education or
higher education environments,

544
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,663
and almost all of the language
says "sense of learning."

545
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,100
It says this emotion,
this feeling of learning,

546
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,135
this feeling like somebody
cares about you,

547
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:57,104
that somebody's got your back,

548
00:28:57,171 --> 00:29:02,176
this feeling like you're
in a place that makes you feel

549
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:07,681
or makes others feel
like you belong there.

550
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,416
You feel it.

551
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:10,751
Then there are
these other things

552
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,519
that happen in these spaces

553
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,955
that we don't like to talk
about, but are really critical

554
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,858
when we talk about building
cultures of belonging,

555
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,227
these objective events
and outcomes.

556
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:21,828
And we'll get to that
in a minute.

557
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:24,097
But essentially
what we mean by that

558
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:26,166
is that there needs to be
policies, practices,

559
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,535
symbols, people, resources

560
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:32,873
that need to be in place
to undergird the feelings,

561
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,810
the subjective experiences
of belonging, right?

562
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:40,147
If we don't have
these objective experiences

563
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:44,685
or objective outcomes,
then the opportunity to belong,

564
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:48,355
versus just having a feeling
of belonging,

565
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:49,790
won't be achieved.

566
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,258
And they're very temporal.

567
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:56,029
The feeling of belonging
is a very temporal experience.

568
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,764
It goes, right?

569
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:00,434
Feelings come, feelings go.

570
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:04,171
However, to belong, to have
experience of belonging,

571
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,707
it's a sustained process.

572
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,043
The other thing
that we'll talk about is agency.

573
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,981
And agency simply means,
at least in this context,

574
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:17,184
simply means
those who want to belong

575
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:22,389
have to have some control
over how and when they belong.

576
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,360
They have to have a say
in the process.

577
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:28,028
They have to have skin
in the game.

578
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:31,164
It's not enough for us to just
tell people, "You belong."

579
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:35,369
If they don't have agency
or skin in the game,

580
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,805
real control, not just this,

581
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,075
you know, "You could come to
the table and say what you want,

582
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,877
but it doesn't matter,"
kind of control,

583
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,546
you have to have some control.

584
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,982
Can you imagine giving control
to our students

585
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:53,187
to have a say and to how, when,
where, and what

586
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:58,025
allows them
to experience belonging?

587
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:00,594
It's not about us,
it's about them.

588
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:01,995
And then the last thing I'll say

589
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,630
is about strength
of social networks.

590
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:04,932
And that's gonna be
quite interesting

591
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:07,367
because it all
revolves around a hypothesis

592
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,303
that we're trying to study.

593
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,637
Okay?

594
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:15,075
So, anybody familiar
with this guy john powell?

595
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,344
That's what I'm talking about.

596
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,580
He directs a center
at UC Berkeley

597
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:24,885
called the Center for Belonging
and Othering at UC Berkeley.

598
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:29,056
If you get a chance,
go on YouTube or anything online

599
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:31,191
and just take a look at some
of his presentations.

600
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:32,993
Take a look
at the center's website

601
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,128
because I think you'll find it
quite interesting.

602
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:39,066
What powell, what john tells us
is that belonging describes

603
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:43,337
more than a feeling
of inclusion or welcome,

604
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,773
more than just
a subjective experience,

605
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,710
and that it's a
very political process

606
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:54,781
and it means a shift in power,
right, a shift in agency.

607
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,521
In order for belonging to exist
for anybody,

608
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,122
they have to have a say.

609
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:07,628
We have to be willing to shift
the distribution of power

610
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:11,698
in any relationship:
educational, families.

611
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,602
Some of us don't even feel like
we belong in our families

612
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:19,373
or in our households,
current households.

613
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,508
Some of our children
and offspring

614
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:23,210
don't feel like they belong

615
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,579
or don't have an experience
of belonging.

616
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:28,081
Many of us know this to be true.

617
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:31,685
So john is telling us
it's about a shift in power.

618
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:34,188
It's not just about a feeling,
it's about agency.

619
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:36,957
It's about creating systems
and resources

620
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:41,028
to support
those subjective experiences.

621
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:48,735
And what happens sometimes
when we don't shift the power,

622
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:53,907
when we don't provide agency
for people to have some control,

623
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:57,411
are two things,
this thing he calls--

624
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,314
or, actually, Claude Steele,
the psychologist at Stanford,

625
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,383
calls belonging uncertainty.

626
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,652
And it means exactly
what it says.

627
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:08,589
You think you belong,
you have a sense of belonging,

628
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:12,693
and something happens
that causes uncertainty

629
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,495
about the sense
that you once had.

630
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:19,299
For example,
I went to the University of--

631
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:22,970
I came to the
University of Wisconsin 2016.

632
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:26,006
And everything around me
suggested that I belonged.

633
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,774
The language suggested that.

634
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,311
Some of the symbols
and the people suggested that.

635
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:34,281
And then there's a thing
that happens.

636
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,350
And that thing
could be very subliminal.

637
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,352
It could be something like

638
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:41,922
somebody looks at you
the wrong way

639
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:44,858
or an issue that
might have come up

640
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,760
that you found
to be deep to your,

641
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:50,631
deep to your own personal sense
of being is ignored.

642
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,033
Or you say something
in a meeting

643
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,801
and nobody pays attention
to you,

644
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,270
and somebody else
says the same thing

645
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:57,471
and they pay attention to them.

646
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,273
It causes you to question,

647
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,609
"Is it because
they're telling me

648
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:05,312
that I actually
don't belong here?"

649
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,247
So, the uncertainty comes up.

650
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:08,649
Our students,
and each one of us

651
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,250
have experienced that
to some degree.

652
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:13,954
And depending on
who you are in this room

653
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:15,822
and what environments
you go into,

654
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,859
you may experience it
more than other people, right?

655
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:21,828
There's behavioral
or belonging uncertainty,

656
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,797
which leads
to this other condition

657
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:27,201
that Claude Steele talks about,
attributional ambiguity,

658
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:30,871
which is essentially,
you start to question

659
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:35,175
the source of these signals
about belonging.

660
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,181
"I wonder if that had something
to do with my race."

661
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:49,790
"I wonder if the message
that I'm receiving from my dean,

662
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,526
"who actually tells me I belong,

663
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:56,163
if it had something
to do with my race."

664
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,899
"Or it had something
to do with the fact

665
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,968
that I'm much more handsome
than he is."

666
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,703
[all laughing]

667
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:05,806
He wouldn't argue that point,
by the way.

668
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:07,541
[all laughing]

669
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:12,346
So, you have this ambiguity
that rises up in you.

670
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,181
Right?

671
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:16,016
And sometimes,
we treat this ambiguity

672
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,218
or our students treat
this ambiguity

673
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,888
as what Claude Steele calls
stereotype threat.

674
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:24,625
In other words,
we try to act out, right?

675
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:29,997
We think that folks have
a stereotype of us,

676
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:34,401
so we act in ways
that we affirm the stereotype.

677
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:38,338
We act in ways
that we affirm the stereotype,

678
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:40,541
which takes us further away
from ourself

679
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:43,677
and disconnects us
from any sense of agency

680
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,846
and any sense of true belonging.

681
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:47,481
But we develop a sense
of belonging

682
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:50,717
because we're trying to fit in.

683
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:54,688
And the distinction between
fitting in and belonging,

684
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:57,291
according to Brené Brown,

685
00:35:57,357 --> 00:36:00,794
fitting in is when you size up
a situation,

686
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:02,129
and if I'm speaking to y'all

687
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:03,597
and y'all understand
what I'm saying,

688
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,099
when you size up a situation

689
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:11,872
and you do whatever you need
to do in order to be accepted.

690
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,607
You wear the mask.

691
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:17,377
You change your behavior,
you change your flow.

692
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:18,712
Right?

693
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:22,416
In essence, you change
who you are in order to fit in.

694
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,518
Now, is that belonging?

695
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,253
I would say not.

696
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,624
Sometimes we ask
those around us to fit in,

697
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,159
and what we're asking them
to do,

698
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:35,662
and they know this to be true,
what we're asking them to do

699
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:38,298
is to size up the situation,

700
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,203
see what you need to do
in order to be accepted.

701
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:48,275
Am I saying something
that folks could understand?

702
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:49,610
Size it up.

703
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:52,079
We're very good at that.

704
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,780
We look at an audience

705
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:56,350
or a classroom
or a relationship.

706
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,051
Sometimes it's down
to the micro level

707
00:36:58,118 --> 00:36:59,219
when we look at somebody

708
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,021
we want to be in an
intimate relationship with

709
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,222
and we size the thing up

710
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,024
and we say, "Okay, I'ma
wear something different.

711
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,459
"I'ma speak different.

712
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,061
I'm gonna engage them
in a very different way."

713
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,931
We're trying to fit in,
which is very temporal,

714
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:13,200
because at some point,

715
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:15,903
at some point,
resentment is gonna set in.

716
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:20,340
At some point, it's gonna
impact your identity formation,

717
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,210
and it's just gonna blow
the thing to death.

718
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,712
Things are gonna fall apart.

719
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:31,051
To belong, as my good friend
Parker Palmer used to say,

720
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,921
it's a form of hospitality.

721
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,823
When you belong,
it's a form of hospitality,

722
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,058
which essentially means

723
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,695
you enter into a space
on your own terms

724
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:45,799
and you're received
for who you are.

725
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,467
You enter a space
on your own terms.

726
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:49,670
You don't have to be
somebody else.

727
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,972
You don't have to negotiate
your identity.

728
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,043
You don't have to explain
your value structure.

729
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,446
You enter in a space
of hospitality.

730
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:04,484
Objective.

731
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,486
We mentioned these,
the other dimensions,

732
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:09,556
the objectives,
objective efforts and outcomes.

733
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:13,060
Symbols, practices, resources,
physical structures.

734
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,596
If you look around the campus,

735
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,631
notice what students
are looking at.

736
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:21,134
Notice what you're looking at,
whose information,

737
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:25,372
whose value is privileged
just by the symbols.

738
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,742
If it's pictures of your board,

739
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,646
if it's pictures of teachers
that receive teaching awards,

740
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:34,648
if it's pictures
of outstanding students.

741
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:36,917
Now, I would say
Madison College

742
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:40,287
is very different than the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.

743
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,923
I'll just put that right there.

744
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,324
Right?

745
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:47,794
The symbols that are reflected
here are much more accepting

746
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,897
and much more expressive

747
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:52,499
of who belongs
and who does not belong.

748
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:55,669
At least, that's the
internalization that I have.

749
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,671
Spaces like the
University of Wisconsin-Madison,

750
00:38:57,738 --> 00:39:01,408
though we're trying,
I still think we're at a point

751
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:04,478
where much of what we tell
people through our symbols,

752
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,880
through our practices,

753
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:09,650
through some of the behaviors
that we engage in,

754
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:13,153
many people receive that
as "You don't belong here,"

755
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,789
because I don't see myself.

756
00:39:16,256 --> 00:39:19,693
There's no way that you're
saying that people like me

757
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,329
belong in places like this.

758
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:25,632
Agency.

759
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,969
Gotta give up the control.

760
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,171
Or at least you have to share
some of the control.

761
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,773
We have to share some
of the power.

762
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,509
We have to invite people
into a hospitable space

763
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:38,545
on their own terms
and who they are.

764
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:41,782
These are what the students
at Mount Horeb taught me.

765
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,584
These are the students
at Shabazz.

766
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,786
Those are the ones
that taught me that,

767
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,020
give up the power.

768
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,223
Can you do that, right?

769
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:53,560
These are the students
at West High-- East.

770
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,529
These are the young people
that told us,

771
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,397
"We have no agency.

772
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,434
"And we act like it.

773
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:05,105
"We give people fodder
to not give us agency.

774
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,874
"We act like
we don't deserve agency

775
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,343
because they won't give us
agency."

776
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,178
In order for belonging to occur,

777
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,880
particularly amongst
young people,

778
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:14,481
they have to have a sense
of agency,

779
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:17,751
and we have to release it,
or at least share it,

780
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:21,021
both in a classroom
and outside of a classroom.

781
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,723
In our families.

782
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,591
Hard thing to do,
I have three boys.

783
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:26,994
I don't like giving up
my power to 'em.

784
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,729
I do not like it.

785
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,366
And when I do,
they reflect it in ways

786
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,168
that I wish I hadn't
given up the power.

787
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:35,903
[all laughing]

788
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,172
Some of y'all know
what I'm talking about.

789
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,907
[all laughing]

790
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:44,811
Okay, there's this thing called
the strength of social networks.

791
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:48,849
And we do network analysis,
social network analysis.

792
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,151
And in a social network,

793
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:55,789
what we're trying to say
is that those around you

794
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:57,591
actually influence

795
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:59,693
and the networks
of which you are part of

796
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,530
influences your experience
of belonging, okay?

797
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,199
But some
of the key characteristics

798
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:07,301
in that relationship
are what we call

799
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,671
frequency of contact
with those in the network,

800
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:13,974
quality of contact
with those in the network,

801
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:17,778
and what I'm calling
alignment of contact

802
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:19,446
with those in the network.

803
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:21,281
The first two
are self-explanatory.

804
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,750
The last one, alignment,
is when you think

805
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:26,053
you're a friend with somebody,

806
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,155
but they don't think
they're a friend of yours.

807
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:30,123
That's a misalignment.

808
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,392
I think I'm friends
with my dean.

809
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:34,127
And I'm so confused by this

810
00:41:34,194 --> 00:41:36,730
because he never
considers me a friend.

811
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:38,532
So when I go
and ask him for something,

812
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,535
I think I'm asking for something
from a friend.

813
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:43,737
That is not the way it works.

814
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:45,472
He's the dean.

815
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:47,107
We have a chancellor.

816
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,910
I think she's, you know,
she's part of my social network.

817
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,545
[chuckling]
Not!

818
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,280
[all laughing]

819
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:56,283
So, here's the theory,
here's the hypothesis.

820
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,452
Okay, so, you have this strength
of social networks.

821
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:01,221
You have belonging
on the left axis,

822
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:04,324
and then you have
what I'm calling relationships

823
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:07,594
on the bottom,
or strengths of relationships.

824
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:10,731
And just for sake of argument,
we have on the bottom,

825
00:42:10,797 --> 00:42:12,266
there are people you engage with

826
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:14,334
and that our students engage
with that have titles:

827
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,969
dean, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah,

828
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:18,772
faculty,
president of X organization.

829
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,774
Then you have
these acquaintances.

830
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:23,177
An acquaintance
could be more than a title,

831
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:25,546
but it's somebody you know,

832
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:28,348
but you don't know 'em well,
right?

833
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,716
You don't know 'em well.

834
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:31,318
You may have coffee
with 'em once.

835
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,353
Think about your networks.

836
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,955
There are people that
you have acquaintances with,

837
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:36,423
there's people that have titles,

838
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,225
and then you have
this thing called a friend,

839
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,227
which is a high social network,

840
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:41,995
a high position
in a social network.

841
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,097
And these people,
you have intimate,

842
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:47,734
trusting relationships with,
right?

843
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,737
So you have title, you have
acquaintances, you have friends.

844
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:53,073
Now the hypothesis is,

845
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,145
the further up this relationship
continuum you go,

846
00:42:58,212 --> 00:43:00,147
in other words,
from title to friend,

847
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:02,149
the closer you get
to friendship,

848
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:06,753
the greater your sense
of belonging, right?

849
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,089
The more you have
in your network

850
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:11,525
people who you consider
to be friends

851
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:13,260
or high acquaintances,

852
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:16,597
the greater your sense
of belonging.

853
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:18,465
It looks like that.

854
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:23,670
Now, what does that mean
for us and our students?

855
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:25,239
Right?

856
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:28,108
What essentially it means
is that we,

857
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:31,512
if we're concerned about
creating spaces of belonging,

858
00:43:31,578 --> 00:43:33,780
we need to create opportunities

859
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:37,985
for us and our students
to engage with people

860
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:42,356
who actually can make
a difference in our lives.

861
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:43,757
Friends.

862
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:46,660
We need to find ways
in which to create opportunities

863
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:50,030
for people to get closer
to other people,

864
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:54,134
not just to be close
to people with titles

865
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:57,604
or closer in proximity
to different people.

866
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:01,575
That's why DEI does not,
is not belonging.

867
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,610
Because you're in contact
with people

868
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:05,979
who look different than you

869
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:08,282
and that you could have
conversations with them

870
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:10,918
does not lead you
to a stronger sense of belonging

871
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:13,787
or an experience of belonging.

872
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,557
Find ways in order
to create in our environment

873
00:44:16,623 --> 00:44:18,425
for people that we care about

874
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:21,061
opportunities
to actually engage with people,

875
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:25,566
to develop strong friendships,
personal friendships,

876
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:27,434
connections with people

877
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,604
who have different strengths
in the social network.

878
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,439
Because if we continue to stay,

879
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,676
like most of us who are
first-generation students,

880
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,744
if we continue
to expose students

881
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:40,247
to people who are like them,
first-generation students,

882
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:44,184
the chances of developing
those strong friendships,

883
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,120
i.e., people who can actually
make decisions

884
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,890
and help you get
what you want to get,

885
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,959
if we don't expose people
to that,

886
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,595
the chances of developing
a strong sense of belonging

887
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:56,330
are very slim.

888
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:02,102
We need to flip the script
and stop talking about quantity

889
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:06,974
and start talking about
quality of relationships.

890
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:10,944
Okay, I should stop right there,

891
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:13,580
but I'm gonna leave this
up here

892
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,983
because I think it's
important to know

893
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,952
that there are some downsides
to belonging.

894
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:21,555
Sometimes for us to belong,

895
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:23,857
that means somebody else
can't belong.

896
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,860
I'm in a fraternity,
I'm sad to say.

897
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,829
The choice I made
to be in the fraternity

898
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,631
was not just because
I wanted to be connected,

899
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:33,333
but I didn't want
other people connected.

900
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,035
It's like families,
it's like churches,

901
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,037
it's like barbershops.

902
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:38,372
Same thing.

903
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:39,540
The myth of superiority.

904
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:40,707
There's a value.

905
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:45,112
Belonging is not
a value-neutral experience.

906
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:48,215
Belonging to certain things
gives you high status.

907
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:50,083
It gives you value.

908
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:55,389
And sometimes the thing to which
we want to belong becomes us.

909
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:58,258
I am the thing that I belong to.

910
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:00,360
When people introduce
themself at parties,

911
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,862
they go, "Oh, what do you do?

912
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,163
Tell me about yourself."

913
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,732
"Well, I'm a psychologist."

914
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:08,435
That doesn't say anything.

915
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:11,171
The thing to which I want
to belong actually defines me.

916
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:12,539
It's my identity.

917
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,274
Who am I?

918
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:18,412
I talk about the thing
that I belong to,

919
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:20,681
and that is not belonging.

920
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:22,850
That is one of the paradoxes
that we deal with

921
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,151
when we talk about belonging.

922
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:26,587
Even if we ask our students,
"Tell me about yourself."

923
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,323
"Well, I'm in engineering."

924
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,459
Or, "I'm in nursing."

925
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:36,763
That's not a description
of themselves.

926
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,833
That's who they belong to
and with.

927
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,735
And these are examples.

928
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,804
An example
that I give my students

929
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:47,441
is that when you think about
a family, right,

930
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:51,612
when you think about a family
and belonging, are we connected?

931
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:54,515
Are those intimate
and personal relationships?

932
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:57,451
Or are they social and public?

933
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:58,619
Right?

934
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:00,821
If you think about
the downside to belonging,

935
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:02,956
there are people who have
associated themselves

936
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,591
with fascism, Nazism,

937
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:08,996
and other type of very
socially harmful gangs.

938
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:14,668
Because they have
a strong need to belong

939
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:17,938
or they've been conditioned
to have a need to belong.

940
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,106
Black barbershops.

941
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,974
Anybody ever been
to a Black barbershop?

942
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,843
Come on, talk to me.

943
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,812
It's an anthropological
experience.

944
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:27,447
[chuckling]

945
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:30,384
If you haven't been
to a Black barbershop,

946
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,219
go in for no other reason

947
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,555
than to get an understanding
about anthropology.

948
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:36,290
My fraternity,

949
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:41,361
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,
Incorporated, my guys,

950
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:43,230
I was conditioned
to be a part of that.

951
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:48,502
Is it an intimate and personal
belonging experience?

952
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:50,237
I'm not sure.

953
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:53,240
Churches, religions,

954
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:58,378
or even, some people
call this a religion,

955
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:00,881
the Wisconsin Badgers.

956
00:48:00,948 --> 00:48:02,616
[audience laughing]

957
00:48:02,683 --> 00:48:05,619
Or the Green Bay Packers.
[chuckling]

958
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:09,389
Can't say that I bought into
that one just yet, but that's...

959
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:12,025
So, these are the downsides

960
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:14,461
or at least the nuanced sides
of belonging.

961
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:15,863
It's not always
a positive thing.

962
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,932
Sometimes we do things
and we internalize the concept

963
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,267
and experience of belonging

964
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:23,670
in ways that are harmful
or not really authentic

965
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,572
and don't reinforce
our self of self,

966
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,307
self of identity.

967
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,576
And that's true
for our students as well,

968
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:32,880
so be mindful that when we tell
them they should belong

969
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:35,415
and when we talk about belonging
for them,

970
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:38,485
it's not always value-neutral.

971
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:41,555
Or it's never value-neutral,
actually.

972
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:43,891
And sometimes it can be harmful.

973
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:46,159
So be mindful of that.

974
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,529
Okay,
I'm gonna leave it at that,

975
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:52,266
leave this up there,
and then we're gonna do Q&A.

976
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,268
But first of all,
I want to thank you all

977
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:57,104
for at least indulging me
with all of my ramblings.

978
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,705
And I wanna give a shout-out

979
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,440
to all the organizations
and communities

980
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:01,942
that have taught me things,

981
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:06,813
the Brodhead community
in Wisconsin, Black Earth.

982
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:10,284
Spent a lot of time with heating
and cooling companies

983
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:13,353
talking about belonging
in Black Earth.

984
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,559
Shabazz, East, West High School,
Mount Horeb Schools,

985
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:21,695
and several other schools
around the state.

986
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:24,698
The University of Oregon
has been very instrumental

987
00:49:24,765 --> 00:49:27,568
in helping us understand
this concept of belonging.

988
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:31,538
University of Missouri,
Penn State, Ohio State,

989
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:34,741
and UVA, University of Virginia.

990
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,045
So, with that,
thank you all very much.

991
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,580
Appreciate you.

992
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,882
