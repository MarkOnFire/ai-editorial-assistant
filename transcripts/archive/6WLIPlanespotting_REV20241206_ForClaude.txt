1
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,117
There's a C-130 coming in.

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,490
Colorado one's next.

3
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,391
This is the one that

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,360
I'm really here for.

5
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,131
It¦s really nice.

6
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,441
I was afraid of planes

7
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,576
originally.

8
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:43,610
Yeah! *Laughs*

9
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:44,311
I kind of like late

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,345
turbulence now.

11
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:45,946
It gives for an

12
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,814
interesting ride.

13
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,819
It's straight for the runway,

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,455
lined up, and ready to land.
