1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,279
I always worked with
my dad, and I got to know him

2
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,848
as good as anybody,
I love being part of the,

3
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,817
the family business,
proud of it.

4
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:21,221
It's something
that I think about all the time,

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,193
Sun drop
came out in the early 50s.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,064
that's the first golden cola
that was on the market.

7
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,100
Yeah, a water.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,136
It's it's
just the greatest water.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,308
what draws a lot of people here

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,145
is that they want to come
and see live bottling.

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,480
there's nothing else like it.

12
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,449
they say family businesses
are the salt of the earth,

13
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,652
the backbone
of small communities.

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,957
And especially in a town
like Shawano. It's really cool.
