00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,706
- Alan Anderson: I have a quote
that I printed out.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,176
"Tradition is not
the saving of ashes.

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:12,145
It's the maintaining of fire."

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,915
I loved it.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,185
[gentle acoustic guitar music]

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,521
My name is Alan Anderson.

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,590
All four of my grandparents
were born in Sweden.

8
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:27,427
Our family has kept a lot of
those Swedish traditions alive

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,830
just because of that reality.

10
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,933
And one of the traditions I have
maintained over the years

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,537
is making a very traditional
Swedish Christmas candle

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,406
called a "grenljus"
or branch candle.

13
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,742
And I think, as far as I know,

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,678
I'm the only one in the United
States who's making them

15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,413
and selling them.

16
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,851
I had never dipped candles
until I tried this.

17
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,819
And it takes a while.

18
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,826
But when I make a batch,
I have to get in the mood.

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,895
Get the wax together.

20
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,732
I have a very large pot that
holds about 30 pounds of wax

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,901
'cause it has to be
fairly deep.

22
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,338
The wicks themselves
are a braided wick.

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,742
So there's a central wick
that forms the bottom

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,445
that goes into a candle holder

25
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,982
and a longer wick
that forms the arch.

26
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,852
All that has to get
put together.

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,255
Some little pins that holds the
wicks into this wooden stick,

28
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,891
and then you're ready to go.

29
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,261
If you dip too fast, too often,

30
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,964
you'll literally melt the wax
off of the wick.

31
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,934
So there's a resting period
between dips.

32
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:48,108
There's this rhythm that I have
as you go through.

33
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,947
And it becomes at one level,
a bit boring, dipping,

34
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,351
and another level
very meditative.

35
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,658
Folk art, in my mind,
is something

36
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:08,028
that is produced by people
by hand,

37
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,997
that's functional,

38
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:15,836
but has been added to by
something that's beautiful.

39
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,143
I'm interested in wood.

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,147
One of the things I've known
from visiting in Sweden,

41
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,317
every time you see something
that a Swedish person has made,

42
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,219
a craftsman, a folk artist,

43
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:37,090
somewhere on that piece,
there's a set of initials.

44
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,726
They've marked it.

45
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,929
It's a matter of pride.

46
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:47,668
There's this very human need
to identify: I made this.

47
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,805
It's not necessary.

48
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,541
It's ornament.

49
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,913
There's a tradition in Sweden.

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,248
A small village would gather

51
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,251
and there would be this effort
to prepare for the winter.

52
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,987
How do we get through the
darkest time in the winter?

53
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,722
We need candles.

54
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,090
Not just for the evening meal,

55
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,827
but also for the religious part
of that.

56
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:18,098
Three-pronged candles were made
specifically in the old days

57
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,468
for Epiphany to celebrate
the Three Wise Men.

58
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,738
And a candle isn't necessarily
a fancy thing.

59
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,173
It's very functional.

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,409
But to take and make
the three-pronged candle

61
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,777
is an odd one.

62
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,780
Why not just have three
candlesticks and three candles?

63
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:37,317
So they did something special
there.

64
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,489
[bright music]

65
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,295
The candles I make will last
about six hours.

66
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,098
So I jokingly say that's enough
for three good meals

67
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,301
or two fantastic meals.
[laughs]

68
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,670
I've told my kids lately

69
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,272
I've got about four and a half
lifetimes

70
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,573
of things I wanna make,

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,476
and I'm running out of time.
[laughs]

72
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,111
For whatever reason,
when I think about

73
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,548
people hanging on
to cultural traditions,

74
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,984
it's about hanging onto things
that are important to them.

75
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,654
They get those importance
from family,

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,324
from their community,
from their culture.

77
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,628
They're memories that
they don't want to lose

78
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:26,333
of important things, fun things,
beautiful things.

79
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,505
It's a memory infused with love.

80
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,944
Make your own traditions.

81
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,582
Figure out something that's your
love to pass on to family,

82
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,451
and that becomes a tradition.

83
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,788
I think that's important.

84
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,490
