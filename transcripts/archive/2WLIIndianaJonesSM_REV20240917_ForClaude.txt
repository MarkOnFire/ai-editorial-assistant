There's some movies

It's a group experience.

Mike Miller knows
he'll be back here again.

that I see the movie,
I know I miss so much.

00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,625
I was easily

doing something on the screen.

So, I really didn't see
the whole movie yet.

17
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:44,083

just one set of films

real-life passion.

came up to me

Mike has his own origin tale.

It started at
a family gathering with his dad.

- I heard him laugh like I had
never heard him laugh before.
[laughter]

He was actually watching
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

57
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,917
But once I found out what
that movie was and everything,

who the actor was,

59

again, it just
started coming all together.

60
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:41,999
- His parents bought him
an Indiana Jones video cassette

61
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:45,166
that sparked his curiosity,

62
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,500
and then the rest was history.

of wanting to surround myself

with those movies.

67
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:02,333
- The magic of these movies
quickly connected with Mike.

68
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,709
- The humor, the adventure,

69
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,375
and how it seemed
to kind of relate to my life,

70
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,500
things that
I was missing in my life.

71
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,667
- Several years after
Indy's<i>Last Crusade,</i>

72
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:18,250
Mike was ready
for the surprising twist

at the box office.

74
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,583
Two film sequels.

like he did
when he was watching<i>Raiders</i>.

Every time I watched the movie,
when a certain scene comes up,

00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,999
it's always gonna be
about that laugh.

it's going to go
above the fireplace.

86
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,291
And then, there's
a fourth movie coming out.

87
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,166
Well, that means
more collecting.

88

- I get this standee
one day in the mail.

89
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,083
So, I started looking
around the house,

90
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,542
trying to figure
out a spot where it can go.

91
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,250
Couldn't figure it out.

92
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,291
Sat down on the couch,
was watching a little TV,

93
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,875
and all of a sudden,

00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,417
my eyes just kind of went
over to the fireplace.

I just got to see
what it looks like.

00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,750
Took down
the wedding picture,

97
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,125
put up the standy
on top of the fireplace.

98

it's almost like I'm waiting.
