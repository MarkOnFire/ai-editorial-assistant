00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:05,792
- Welcome
to<i>University Place Presents.</i>

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm Norman Gilliland.

4
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:08,999
During the 20th century,

5
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:13,166
a fair number of U.S.
presidents have been able,

6
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:18,250
quite successfully, to project
American policy and power

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,959
in speeches given overseas.

8
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,542
How did they go about it?

9
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:27,999
With me is Allison Prasch;
she's a professor

10
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,250
of Communications, Comm Arts,
at the UW-Madison,

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,000
and also the author of the book
<i>The World is Our Stage:</i>

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,959
The Global Rhetorical Presidency
<i>and the Cold War,</i>

13
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,208
published by the University
of Chicago Press in 2023.

14
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,291
Welcome
to<i>University Place Presents.</i>

15
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,875
- Thank you so much
for having me.

16
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,500
- A fascinating topic

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,834
whenever you're talking about
communication and presidents,

18
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:55,208
but in terms of global thinking,
the 20th century,

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,583
because of the technology,
pretty much is where it is.

20
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,542
Of course, 21st century too.

21
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:01,999
- Mm-hmm, absolutely.

22
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:03,999
Well, and I think when
we're talking about

23
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,792
the projection of American power
and influence,

24
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,041
we have to look at one
of the first instances

25
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,999
of where and how a president
chose to go abroad

26
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:13,999
because it's not just the fact

27
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:16,000
that they wanted
to leave the country.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,917
It's also the fact

29
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,999
that they wanted to articulate
and embody

30
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:22,500
what U.S. foreign policy meant
at key junctures

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
during the 20th century.

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,375
- So the first U.S. president
to go abroad

33
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,041
during his presidency was...

34
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:33,375
- Teddy Roosevelt; in 1906,
he makes the decision

35
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,417
to travel to the
Panama Canal Zone.

36
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:40,999
And in that tour, he begins
to help U.S. Americans

37
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,999
see and understand
the relationship

38
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,834
of Panama to the United States.

39
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,999
- And how does
he go about that?

40
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:49,458
What is the technology?

41
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:55,458
- Well, so Teddy Roosevelt
set sail in November 1906,

42
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,999
and he makes the decision
to be very public

43
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:00,375
about his decision to go abroad.

44
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,208
And as you might imagine,

45
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:05,000
because it is the first time
that a U.S. president

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,417
is leaving the borders
of the nation while in office,

47
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:13,166
Teddy Roosevelt will be
very explicit with his audience

48
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,458
and journalists that
he is going abroad

49
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,083
as an emissary
for the U.S. public.

50
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,583
And so, although journalists
and political pundits

51
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,250
are very concerned about the
fact that maybe Roosevelt

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,083
won't be able to do the duties
of his office,

53
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:28,999
he's very clear about,

54
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:32,250
"I can be reached by telegraph
in various places."

55
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,999
But he also makes the decision
to bring journalists with him

56
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:39,375
who are going to photograph him
being in specific places.

57
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,999
And so one of the
most iconic images

58
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:45,166
that we have of Teddy Roosevelt
in the Panama Canal Zone

59
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,959
is this image of Roosevelt

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,250
sitting on one of the
building materials,

61
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,125
this digger essentially
in early 20th century terms

62
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,834
that is part of the construction
of the Panama Canal.

63
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:03,625
- And that right away implies
this projection of power

64
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,333
'cause he's on this
massive machine,

65
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,999
this changer
of world transportation.

66
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,458
- Absolutely,
and it also demonstrates

67
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,542
the fact that the United States

68
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,792
was very invested
in building the Panama Canal.

69
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,999
They knew that it was
going to be really important

70
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,000
for the U.S. economy,
for global trade,

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,166
but Teddy Roosevelt
also goes down there

72
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,999
because there is
grave public concern

73
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,875
of what he will describe as
"getting down into the ditch."

74
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,999
And so he'll say to the public,

75
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,125
"I wanna see what's going on
down in the ditch.

76
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,083
"I'm gonna go look at it
for you.

77
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,125
"I'm going to see it with my
own eyes, and I will come back

78
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,000
"and report to the U.S. public
of what I saw

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,125
"and why U.S. involvement in
doing this construction project

80
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,291
in the Panama Canal Zone
is so important and necessary."

81
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,834
- And so these pictures of T.R.

82
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,834
would've shown up in,
like, the Hearst newspapers

83
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,834
and all the other
big periodicals of the time.

84
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:02,333
- Absolutely, and one of the
most notable examples of this

85
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,458
is when Teddy Roosevelt returns
to the United States,

86
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,750
he's very deliberate
about wanting to make sure

87
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,667
that citizens see these images,

88
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,917
not just in
<i>The New York Times.</i>

89
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,999
There is a 13-page spread
where citizens can see images

90
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,999
not just of Teddy Roosevelt,
but also his surroundings

91
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:21,375
and what it looks like to be
creating the Panama Canal.

92
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,417
But he also makes sure that
these images are published

93
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,792
in the Congressional Record.

94
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,166
And it's the first time
that images

95
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,250
are actually part of the
Congressional Record.

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,583
And for some senators, they're
very concerned about this.

97
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,999
They feel like this is
a deviation of norms.

98
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,500
- So non-traditional.
- So non-traditional, right?

99
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,667
But Roosevelt is adamant
that he wants the public

100
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,041
to see him in the
Panama Canal Zone.

101
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,583
And of course for Roosevelt,
this is really an extension

102
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:50,417
of American power and influence
in South America.

103
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,583
He believes that
the United States

104
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,125
should have a role to play
in how these democracies

105
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,999
or what should become
democracies, according to him,

106
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,917
are going to hold themselves

107
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,667
to a particularly higher
standard, he says.

108
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,999
And so he believes
that these images

109
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,083
are going to help
the public envision

110
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:09,000
the United States' role
in the world at this moment.

111
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,542
- When we get to the years
of World War I,

112
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,999
and now United States
is really involved

113
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,667
in international affairs.

114
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,375
And the President of the
United States, Woodrow Wilson,

115
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:27,417
is very much involved, both
hands, international affairs,

116
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,917
pushing the League of Nations,

117
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,999
of course, getting
through the war.

118
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,625
How does he pitch his cause?

119
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,875
- Well, Woodrow Wilson is known,
as you mentioned,

120
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,999
as a decided internationalist,
and he recognizes

121
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,999
that the world is quickly
getting much larger.

122
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,999
That this argument
that you can stay,

123
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,959
remain focused on the
North American continent,

124
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,999
is just not gonna hold up
as history proceeds.

125
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,542
And so if we think
about where and how

126
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:58,709
Wilson decides to portray
American power, notably,

127
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,667
for example,
he's gonna make the case

128
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:04,333
that the United States
has a moral obligation

129
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,333
to make the world safe
for democracy

130
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,999
in the lead up to the Great War,
what we now know as World War I.

131
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:13,834
But it's notable that at the
conclusion of the Great War,

132
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,583
Wilson will make the decision
to travel to Versailles

133
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,709
and to participate
in the Peace Conference

134
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,792
to bring an end to the war.

135
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,250
And where Teddy Roosevelt
makes the decision

136
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,999
to go to Panama,
the Panama Canal Zone,

137
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:27,875
and becomes the first president

138
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,542
to leave the borders of the
United States while in office,

139
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,917
Wilson's decision
is much more significant.

140
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:35,999
Because if you think back

141
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,166
to some of the most
famous cautions

142
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,041
that the founders made against
getting involved overseas,

143
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,250
you think about Washington
and you think about Jefferson.

144
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,000
Washington is very concerned
that a new nation needs

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,542
to remain focused
on its own affairs.

146
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,999
And Jefferson will make the case

147
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,166
that we need to avoid
these entangling alliances.

148
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,834
They are both talking
about Europe, understandably,

149
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,999
because they have recently
declared independence

150
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:01,834
from Great Britain.

151
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,583
So when Wilson makes the
decision to go to Versailles,

152
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,999
he is the first president,
not just to leave

153
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,999
the borders of the nation,
Roosevelt did that,

154
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,375
but he is the first president
to go to Europe.

155
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:16,125
And this is seen as a
markedly different step

156
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,875
than Roosevelt going south.

157
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:22,709
Wilson is crossing the ocean,
he's there for several months,

158
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,999
and people are really concerned

159
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,834
about the fact of,
can he do the job as president

160
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,500
and what does this mean

161
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,542
about the United States'
relationship with Europe?

162
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:37,750
- And what does he do then
to promote his cause, Wilson?

163
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,999
- Well, he makes the case
to a joint session of Congress

164
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,999
right before he leaves.

165
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,125
The war is coming to a close,

166
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,625
we need to create
this peace treaty

167
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,166
and a war to end all wars,
essentially.

168
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:53,166
And Wilson makes an argument
that he is uniquely qualified

169
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,625
as President of the
United States

170
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,041
to bring a leadership role

171
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,125
to Versailles,
to the Peace Conference.

172
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:04,917
And some senators and members
of Congress are really upset

173
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,166
that he is donning this mantle.

174
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,667
In fact, that they are upset
that they are not the ones going

175
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,375
because they are making
an argument, essentially

176
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,999
against the spread of executive
power in foreign policy.

177
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:15,999
But Wilson goes anyway,

178
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:21,041
and he enjoys mass crowds
that are there to greet him,

179
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:25,125
to celebrate U.S. intervention
in this Great War.

180
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,999
And he's really heralded
as this leader in the fight

181
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,417
to protect and defend democracy,

182
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,750
which Wilson himself
had set up his cause

183
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,667
to be focused upon.

184
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:39,250
- Is he using print media
mostly to promote this cause

185
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,542
across the Atlantic,

186
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,166
or does he actually
use other media

187
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,458
which are just now
coming into use?

188
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,792
- They're just now
coming into use.

189
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,750
Most of what the public
is going to see

190
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,709
both in the United States
and around the world,

191
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,083
are going to be images,
like the one

192
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,458
that we may have access to now,
if we see this image

193
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,999
of Wilson attending the
Paris Peace Conference,

194
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,750
it's gonna give an image
of a U.S. president

195
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,208
that is present
in these larger discussions

196
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,375
and debates about what role
the world should look like,

197
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,667
that the role that
the United States

198
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,208
should take in the world
following the Great War.

199
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:17,917
- Were speeches recorded
in either audio

200
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,000
or more likely
just in the press?

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,625
- There was some dissemination
of Wilson's statements,

202
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,500
although I will say,

203
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,917
this idea that Wilson is going
to be abroad for so long,

204
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,333
there is this assumption
that if you're going to speak

205
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,417
to the U.S. public,
you have to do it

206
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,959
in the borders of the nation.

207
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,999
And so there
would be journalists

208
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,125
or press reports
that would talk about

209
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,875
Wilson's comings and goings
or little snippets,

210
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,083
but really the focus
is on the image

211
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,875
that he is going to portray
while he is in Versailles.

212
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,792
And then of course,
he'll famously come back

213
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,999
and make the case
to the American people

214
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,208
about the League of Nations,
which ultimately fails.

215
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,166
But he's going to do
that campaigning

216
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,834
and going to make
those public speeches

217
00:09:56,834 --> 00:10:00,417
for dissemination in the print
media in the United States.

218
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,875
- And as we get into the 1920s

219
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:07,750
and further then into the early
1930s, now we have a medium

220
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,959
with which the
president can address

221
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,500
virtually the entire country
instantaneously.

222
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,667
- Absolutely.
- And a great user of radio

223
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:22,000
was Franklin D. Roosevelt
with his fireside chats.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
- Yeah; well,
and the thing, I mean--

225
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,125
It is not an overstatement
to say that the medium of radio

226
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,792
and FDR's use of it is going
to fundamentally transform

227
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,208
how we think about
and understand

228
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,583
presidential communication.

229
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,291
And one of the reasons
for that is, as you noted,

230
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,999
just as FDR is
coming into office,

231
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,458
the end of the '20s
and running for election,

232
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,208
and we also see this coinciding
with the Great Depression,

233
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:52,083
Americans are beginning to turn
to the radio for news.

234
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,375
They're still looking
at print media,

235
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,959
but they're also
concerned about the radio.

236
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,583
And so when FDR ascends
to the presidency,

237
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,999
he wins the
presidential election in 1932,

238
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,333
takes the oath of office
in 1933,

239
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,125
he delivers his famous
first inaugural,

240
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,917
but he also is going
to deliver a fireside chat

241
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,999
just two days later
in which he begins and says,

242
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,208
"My friends," and he's speaking
to the American people.

243
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,041
And the assumption
is that he is addressing

244
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,709
the entire citizenry
around the country.

245
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,875
And some people overseas
are also listening to him

246
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,625
and making an argument
for them of why they need

247
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,583
to take the money out
from under their mattresses,

248
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:37,166
to recognize that yes, the
Great Depression is a travesty.

249
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,458
It's this very
concerning situation.

250
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,500
And yet he's taking the helm

251
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,709
and this mantle
of rhetorical leadership,

252
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,542
and he does it
through the radio.

253
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:51,959
- And as effective as FDR is
with those fireside chats,

254
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,000
he does have this
rendezvous with destiny

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,709
that comes in 1941
where he has to make, really,

256
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,625
what's the speech of his life.

257
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,999
- Absolutely;
so we think about FDR

258
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,999
in relationship
to the Great Depression,

259
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:09,375
but then when we get to 1939,

260
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,999
we think specifically
about the role

261
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,125
that he's going to begin to play

262
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:17,000
as we think about U.S. entry
into World War II.

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,291
And it's important
to remember that in 1939,

264
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,458
when Germany is going
to invade Poland

265
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,999
at the beginning of September,

266
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,959
the United States'
general public opinion

267
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,999
is deep concern
over U.S. involvement abroad.

268
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:31,999
We talked about Wilson,

269
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,750
this idea that he's this
great internationalist.

270
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,834
And in the 1920s
and moving into the 1930s

271
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,750
and this concern
over the Great Depression,

272
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,417
some people will claim

273
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:44,999
that it is because of U.S. entry
into World War I

274
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,999
that we entered this moment
of economic catastrophe.

275
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:55,709
And so when FDR begins to take
this leadership role in 1939,

276
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,999
he's really butting up
against members of Congress

277
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,375
who are severe isolationists,

278
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,291
but he also is an
internationalist

279
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,291
and he knows the realities
of the situation.

280
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,208
And so in 1939, 1940,

281
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,625
leading all the way up
to December 1941,

282
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:15,000
FDR really is in this
difficult position

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,834
of trying to articulate
to a U.S. public,

284
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,667
"We're gonna get drawn
into this war.

285
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:20,458
"It's only a matter of time,

286
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,542
"and we need to really recognize
that we have a role

287
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:26,999
"to take in leading the world
in this fight

288
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,291
against the Nazi regime."

289
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,999
And so then,
December 7, 1941 happens.

290
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,999
And so now we're
gonna listen to a clip

291
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:37,291
from his famous address
that FDR delivers

292
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,291
in front of a joint session
of Congress

293
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,208
on December 8, 1941.

294
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:47,041
- Mr. Vice President,
Mr. Speaker,

295
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:51,999
members of the Senate and
of the House of Representatives,

296
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,500
yesterday, December 7, 1941,

297
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:06,417
a date which will live
in infamy,

298
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,667
the United States of America

299
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,291
was suddenly and
deliberately attacked

300
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:18,999
by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.

301
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,000
The United States was at peace
with that nation,

302
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:33,291
and, at the solicitation of
Japan, was still in conversation

303
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,125
with its government
and its emperor,

304
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:41,999
looking toward the maintenance
of peace in the Pacific.

305
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,750
Indeed, one hour
after Japanese air squadrons

306
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,625
had commenced bombing
in the American island of Oahu,

307
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:58,542
the Japanese ambassador
to the United States

308
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:05,667
and his colleague delivered
to our Secretary of State

309
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:11,291
a formal reply to a
recent American message.

310
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,667
And while this reply stated
that it seemed useless

311
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:21,500
to continue the existing
diplomatic negotiations,

312
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:30,834
it contained no threat or hint
of war or of armed attack.

313
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:38,625
It will be recorded that the
distance of Hawaii from Japan

314
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:43,959
makes it obvious that the attack
was deliberately planned

315
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,667
many days or even weeks ago.

316
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,999
- Clearly, it was a
very effective speech.

317
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:57,333
The vote was virtually unanimous
to declare war on Japan.

318
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,208
- Mm-hmm; it was very effective
for a number of reasons.

319
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:04,375
I mean, yes, in terms
of the votes that are required

320
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,999
to declare war on Japan,
it's very effective.

321
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,083
And I think one of the things
that makes this speech

322
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:14,625
so memorable is that FDR
essentially prosecutes a case

323
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:19,917
as to why it is necessary and
in the U.S. national interest

324
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:20,999
to declare war on Japan.

325
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:24,000
And then we know very quickly,
Germany will declare war

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,999
on the United States
and vice versa.

327
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,375
But the other thing that I
would note about this speech

328
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,083
from a rhetorical perspective

329
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:35,999
is FDR is quite careful
about listing facts.

330
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,750
So for example,
notice he begins by saying,

331
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,417
"December 7, 1941, a<i>date
</i> that will live in infamy."

332
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,542
By describing this as a date,

333
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:50,291
he is establishing it on the
marker of public consciousness

334
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,999
to understand that this is
not just a day or an event

335
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,375
or something that happened.

336
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,792
This is going to forever change

337
00:16:56,792 --> 00:17:00,542
how we think about our
participation in the world.

338
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:01,959
The other thing
that I would note

339
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,333
is that in both this speech
and then later fireside chats

340
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,999
that FDR delivers
to the U.S. public

341
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,125
as the United States
is entering World War II

342
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,542
and participating in,
those early years,

343
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,417
we forget this,
but it does not look good

344
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,917
for U.S. troops in multiple
theaters of the war.

345
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:22,417
He takes this opportunity
to articulate to a U.S. public

346
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,834
distances between countries,
subtly undermining the argument

347
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,333
that no, it's not that
we're surrounded by this ocean

348
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,333
that we'll be okay.

349
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,291
He takes time to articulate
to an audience

350
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,999
of this is how many miles,
for example,

351
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,667
it's going to be from various
German military bases

352
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,417
to the United States.

353
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,208
And so he is laying out
a very careful,

354
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,999
clearly articulated argument

355
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:49,333
that is going to subtly
undermine his critics

356
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,250
who have argued
for isolationism.

357
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,333
And FDR is essentially saying,

358
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,041
"We don't have that option
anymore.

359
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,208
And here's the case for why."

360
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,375
- A very powerful speech.

361
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,166
And I'm reminded of something
that Winston Churchill--

362
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:06,083
well, that FDR actually asked
about Winston Churchill.

363
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:10,999
Asked one of his aides,
"So who writes his stuff?"

364
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,583
And the answer was,
"Well, sir, I think he does."

365
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,208
[Allison and Norman laughing]

366
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:15,792
- Yes.

367
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,959
- But do we know who
the speech writers were

368
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:22,999
and what FDR's involvement was
in this Pearl Harbor speech?

369
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:23,999
- It's an excellent question.

370
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:27,625
I have spent some time
in the FDR archives,

371
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,500
which are in Hyde Park,
New York.

372
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,291
I haven't delved into the
particular archives

373
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,166
for this speech,

374
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,208
but what I can tell you
is that this speech,

375
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,709
the December 8, 1941 address
to Congress

376
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:44,999
is very closely linked to a
December 9, 1941 fireside chat

377
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,750
that FDR delivers.

378
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,999
So essentially, you can think
about the December 8 speech

379
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:51,999
as one that FDR is delivering
on a more public stage

380
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,291
to members of Congress
to ask for that vote,

381
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,083
where the December 9, 1941
fireside chat

382
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,667
is really continuing
in this tradition

383
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,999
of sitting down with his
friends, his fellow Americans,

384
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,583
and explaining the cause
of the war.

385
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,041
And in those speechwriting
files, what's remarkable

386
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,875
is you see individuals
such as Sam Rosenman,

387
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,792
who's one of his
closest speech writers

388
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,417
who will write drafts,
give them to Roosevelt,

389
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,999
Roosevelt will make notes,
marginalia,

390
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,083
hand them back to Rosenman,

391
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,999
is that there is really
this back and forth

392
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,291
working relationship
between the two of them.

393
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,709
And those files
also do demonstrate

394
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,125
this remarkable bit of humanity.

395
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,166
So in those files that I looked
at for the fireside chat,

396
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,792
the December 9 one,
you see cigarette burns.

397
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:38,333
You see coffee stains
that you can imagine

398
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,542
someone in the White House

399
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,917
staying up all
hours of the night

400
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,875
trying to articulate this
very uncertain moment

401
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,625
and situation.

402
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,000
And that's why
we go to the archives.

403
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,959
Because it humanizes and
gives us insight into the past

404
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,999
in ways that we're not
gonna see performed

405
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,125
on this very public stage.

406
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,500
- Might have been a few
cocktails involved too.

407
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,625
- All of the above,
yes, all of the above.

408
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,625
- The fireside chats then.

409
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,750
And it was the custom
of the time

410
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,959
to script practically
everything.

411
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:06,458
- Allison: Yes.

412
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,917
- That came out over the radio,
but they were all scripted.

413
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,999
Do you have a sense at all

414
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:13,917
that he ever ad-libbed
any of those lines?

415
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,792
- There are very few cases,

416
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,999
and in those cases
of the fireside chats

417
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:23,083
that he would ad-lib,
he would read over them himself

418
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,834
and then he would make
little comments with a pen

419
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,375
before he was going
to deliver it.

420
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,166
But he did really like
to stick to the script.

421
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,208
He was very comfortable
with that.

422
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,999
And he also understood that
there was something important

423
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,959
about the gravitas, the delivery

424
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,375
that he would offer
over the radio.

425
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,208
It was this sense of certainty

426
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,999
between himself
and his audience.

427
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,999
And so when he was ready
to deliver a fireside chat,

428
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,834
he was convinced that
it was ready to go

429
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,875
and that it was what
he wanted to say

430
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,458
to the American people.

431
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,333
- And what kind of tone?

432
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,999
Now, FDR was an
American aristocrat

433
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,083
when you come right down to it,

434
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:08,250
but he's talking
to Dust Bowl Okies,

435
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,667
he's talking to laborers,
he's talking to a lot of people

436
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,750
who are probably
still unemployed,

437
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,000
and also to the upper crust.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,625
What kind of tone does he set
to cover all that humanity?

439
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,792
- It's such a great question.

440
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,417
What's really interesting
about FDR

441
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,999
as a public speaker,
as a president,

442
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,709
is that he understands
that he is connecting

443
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,500
vast and disparate swaths
of the U.S. electorate, right?

444
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,999
He absolutely is coming
from old money in New York,

445
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:42,875
but he also recognizes

446
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,792
that he's speaking
to individuals in poverty.

447
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,250
And so one of the things
that he does

448
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,917
throughout all of his speeches,
but I would argue

449
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,999
is most prominent
in the fireside chats,

450
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,375
is he will rely on
a lot of language

451
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,542
that connects himself
to his audience.

452
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,959
So he'll say things like,

453
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,625
"I understand you
might feel this way,"

454
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,458
or "I remember a time
when this happened to me."

455
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,041
And it's deeply personal

456
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,834
and connecting to the audience
where they are.

457
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,999
He's also going to adopt
not just a tone,

458
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:14,959
but a persona or a
public image of himself

459
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:19,000
as someone who is naturally
a political leader

460
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,999
and is an expert
in world affairs.

461
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,959
And so essentially going
to make the argument

462
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,375
that "I can lead the nation
at this moment

463
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,834
going into World War II."

464
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,333
And he doesn't say it,
this directly,

465
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,083
but "I have more experience
than you do,

466
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,792
"and let me explain to you why.

467
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,625
"Let me be a teacher,

468
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,375
"let me educate you in
particular ways about the world

469
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,917
and our place in it."

470
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:38,583
And he's able to do that

471
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:42,250
because he has developed this
persona as this public teacher

472
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,709
and historian
to the U.S. public.

473
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:50,041
- Were those fireside chats
above and beyond criticism

474
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:55,166
you know, such as you would find
of any other aspect

475
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,166
of the media of the time,
whether it was a film or a book

476
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:03,250
or anything else;
they were such a novel idea.

477
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,999
Did you come across
any response?

478
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:09,375
- Yes, well, this is
what's fascinating.

479
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,999
So depending on which
historian you talk to,

480
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:15,959
there are between 33
and 34 fireside chats,

481
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,208
depending on how we know that
they are termed a fireside chat.

482
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,041
And that's actually important

483
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:23,999
because FDR will deliver other
addresses over the radio.

484
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:25,875
That again, is the main medium
of the time,

485
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:29,709
but not every radio address
is dubbed a fireside chat.

486
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,500
Part of that has to do with
when he would deliver them.

487
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,667
The fireside chats often
happened on a Sunday evening

488
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,999
around 9:00 PM
or 10:00 PM Eastern Time.

489
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,083
And so across the nation,
families would gather,

490
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,041
they would have dinner together,

491
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,625
they would be in church
basements together,

492
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:48,834
and they would tune in over
the radio and listen to FDR.

493
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,125
And because of this,
it becomes very much

494
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,999
of a communal experience.

495
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,625
And individuals who had
only heard their president

496
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:59,667
speak to them or talk to them
through printed mediums,

497
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,999
so newspaper articles,
the Congressional Record,

498
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:05,625
for example, now they literally
can listen to him do it.

499
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:09,999
And so there is this mythic
quality to these fireside chats.

500
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,999
It doesn't mean that FDR

501
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,083
doesn't have his critics
or his detractors,

502
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:18,000
but there is kind of this
elevated sacredness to them

503
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,917
that makes people
listen to them.

504
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,709
The other thing that I would say

505
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:25,999
is the volume of public mail
that is sent to the White House

506
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,999
after each fireside chat
is massive.

507
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:32,125
There's historians
who have collected

508
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,875
a sampling of those letters,
and if you read those letters,

509
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,166
you see that the public
is saying things like,

510
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,750
"I feel like the President
of the United States

511
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,792
"understands my situation.

512
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,250
"I feel like he was there
with me in my living room

513
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,041
"understanding my
economic plight or my concern

514
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,999
about my son going to war."

515
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:53,709
And so as he literally
entered the houses

516
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,417
of millions of Americans
across the country,

517
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,041
they felt like they
were being spoken to

518
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,375
and communicated with
in a way that was distinct

519
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,041
from all other presidents
up to that point.

520
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,999
- In a way, you could say
that the FDR presidency

521
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:11,083
was kind of the pinnacle
of love and respect

522
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:15,208
for an American president,
because there would even be

523
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:19,583
on radio, for example, there
was an hour-long celebration

524
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:20,999
of the president's birthday.

525
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,333
- Yes.
- Inconceivable.

526
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,250
- Yes.
- For that anytime afterward.

527
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,041
- Mm-hmm, yes.

528
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:31,000
- So he clearly was very
powerful in the medium of radio.

529
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,999
And as you say, the first time
that virtually all Americans

530
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,999
would've heard their
president speak.

531
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:43,166
- Yes.
- Because of this medium.

532
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,083
So 1941, the
beginning of the war,

533
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,999
what sort of things is he saying

534
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:52,291
on an international level
as the war progresses?

535
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,125
- Well, his overarching
argument is that

536
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:58,417
the United States has no other
option but to get involved.

537
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,999
And that obviously
becomes quite apparent

538
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,750
after the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor.

539
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,959
But this is an argument
that FDR has been making

540
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,999
ever since 1939.

541
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,999
He's just trying to slowly
shift U.S. public opinion

542
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,917
to help the public
get to that place.

543
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,333
And they are
understandably wary of war

544
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,999
in light of the Great War,
World War I,

545
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,291
and then the Great Depression.

546
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,792
But after the United States
enters the war,

547
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,041
FDR is quite clear
with his audience

548
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,291
that not only should the
United States be involved,

549
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,917
but they have a moral
and ethical obligation

550
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,417
to take a position
of world leadership.

551
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:36,999
And that's really the message
that he will articulate

552
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,542
in many different ways,
in many different places.

553
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,999
But he is constantly
wanting to portray

554
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,999
American leadership abroad
as the only option.

555
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:50,625
And FDR also recognizes that
hopefully this war will end,

556
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:55,083
and he wants the United States
to continue to play this role

557
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,999
as a global leader
after the war.

558
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:02,999
- And I would guess that
one emblem, one image of that

559
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:07,667
would be when we start to see
him with Roosevelt and Stalin.

560
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,500
- Yes, yes, so many
of the most famous images

561
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,917
are with Roosevelt
seated in the middle

562
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:15,875
and then Churchill and Stalin
on either side.

563
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,542
- Norman: How did they decide,
by the way,

564
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:19,500
that sequence, do you know?
[Allison laughing]

565
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,125
- Well, I know for a fact
that FDR was deliberate

566
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,333
of always being
in the middle chair.

567
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,999
It was something
that he routinely did

568
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:30,083
every single time
in every single photograph

569
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,999
that they're known
as the Big Three.

570
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,834
So Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin,

571
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:36,709
the U.S. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt,

572
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:39,667
and then the British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill.

573
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,917
And they're gonna have
three different summits

574
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,542
that they will meet at together.

575
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:49,333
The first one is going to be
at Tehran in 1943.

576
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,291
- Norman: We're seeing that.
- Allison: Yep.

577
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:56,709
There's also then will be one
in Yalta in February of 1945.

578
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,999
And that image is similar

579
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,959
because FDR is seated
between these two individuals,

580
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,875
but he looks very frail,
very weak,

581
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,208
and you can see this decline.

582
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:10,000
And then the third and final
Big Three conference,

583
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,834
you'll notice on the image here,
FDR is gone.

584
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:15,375
And that's because

585
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,291
this third and final conference
of the Big Three

586
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,999
that happens in Potsdam
in July and August of 1945

587
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,250
happens after Roosevelt's
untimely death.

588
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,875
And so Harry Truman
is put into this position

589
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:26,999
where he literally
and symbolically

590
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:31,125
has to step into FDR's shoes
at the conclusion of the war.

591
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,917
- Norman: In the middle
of the picture.

592
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,250
- Allison: In the middle
of the picture.

593
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,999
And I can tell you about this
particular image,

594
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:38,417
there's some really fascinating
first-person accounts

595
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,542
of U.S. Army photographers
who are stationed

596
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,999
to take these images
for the U.S. government.

597
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,166
And they talk about
after the fact

598
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,999
that Truman was deliberate,

599
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:51,000
that Stalin was attempting
to sit in the middle chair

600
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,500
and he walked right past him
and sat down,

601
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,041
and he had no other option
but to sit on the other side.

602
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,083
And it tells us something
about what Truman understands

603
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,208
the United States' role
in the world was,

604
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,417
and how the public
needed to see that

605
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:05,041
be encapsulated
through these images.

606
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:05,999
- Because as you say,

607
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:11,999
Truman had a big pair
of shoes to fill there in,

608
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,792
after 12 years
of an FDR presidency

609
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:19,000
through the Great Depression,
through World War II,

610
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,999
through all of the
fireside chats.

611
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:22,792
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:28,291
- Truman has some speeches
of his own that he has to give.

613
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,291
Do you have the sense

614
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:34,000
that he was naturally the
same kind of orator as FDR?

615
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,166
How would he have approached
things differently?

616
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:39,999
He was certainly known
as the common man, unlike FDR.

617
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:43,458
- Absolutely, and he
prides himself on being able

618
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:47,500
to speak to the people,
to the common people in ways

619
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,041
that are unique
and distinct from FDR.

620
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:52,875
Even as I would argue

621
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,291
that FDR is a much more
effective communicator.

622
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,999
It's also the case,
let's remember,

623
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,041
that Harry Truman never
wanted to be president.

624
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,999
That was not something
that he sought;

625
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:05,667
he's very upset for multiple
reasons when FDR dies.

626
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:10,000
But one of them is that he
feels completely unequipped.

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,166
And in many ways, he was.

628
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:16,999
FDR only met with him privately
twice prior to his death.

629
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,125
And so Truman recognizes

630
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:21,500
that not only is he stepping
into these enormous shoes

631
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,291
and that a large swath
of the U.S. public,

632
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,041
the only president they can
really remember with clarity

633
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:31,041
is FDR or the only president
in their lifetime.

634
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:34,999
Truman suddenly has to take on
this role at a crucial moment.

635
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,959
When FDR dies, Berlin is still
in control of Nazi Germany.

636
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:44,792
- And Japan is still very much
at war and an unknown quantity

637
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:47,041
in terms of what
they can actually do.

638
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,166
- Absolutely,
so Truman recognizes

639
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,417
that he has massive shoes
to fill.

640
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,667
And so one of the things
that he does is,

641
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,000
like we talked about
in the two images of trying

642
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,625
to articulate his centrality
to the Big Three alliance,

643
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,917
but also being very clear
in his public statements

644
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:06,792
that his job is
to continue the policies

645
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,291
that FDR would've supported

646
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:12,083
because he knows that FDR
had wide public appeal

647
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:12,917
and public support.

648
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:16,542
And so he knows that the best
way to continue that legacy

649
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,709
is to follow what he believes
FDR would have done.

650
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:25,041
- How is he using the media
then, Truman?

651
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,834
No more fireside chats.

652
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,500
- He will deliver
radio addresses,

653
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,083
but he will not call them
officially fireside chats.

654
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,999
That would almost
seem, like, sacrilegious

655
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,999
because they have
become such a staple

656
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:38,999
of FDR's rhetorical wheelhouse.

657
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,999
One of the things that
Truman does do though

658
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,999
is he recognizes the power
of imagery.

659
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:44,542
FDR did as well,

660
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:49,709
but let's also remember that
FDR was a disabled president.

661
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,750
He was very careful

662
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,250
about not attempting
to walk in public places

663
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,999
where he could be photographed
using a cane or crutches.

664
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,999
If he were to stand
and deliver speeches,

665
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,917
it was very carefully
choreographed.

666
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:03,792
And there was essentially

667
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:05,667
this gentlemen's agreement
within the press

668
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,333
that various photographs
would not be shared

669
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,999
because he believed
it was so important

670
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:14,834
to present this
strong public persona.

671
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,041
Truman, on the other hand,
is very mobile.

672
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,125
He's able to go places
and do things

673
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,792
that FDR would've had to avoid,

674
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:26,959
given the various limits
on where he could go

675
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:27,625
and how he could move.

676
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,999
And so, for example,
when Truman is in Potsdam

677
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,583
at this third and final
Big Three conference,

678
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,792
Potsdam is just outside Berlin.

679
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:39,375
And so Truman goes and takes
a driving tour of Berlin.

680
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,542
- Norman: Here he is;
we'll see this.

681
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,542
It's a remarkable picture.

682
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,583
- Allison: It's two
remarkable pictures.

683
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:47,375
What's fascinating
is you see on the left,

684
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,542
you see Truman in this car
going through

685
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:54,041
and touring the streets
of a decimated Berlin.

686
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,291
And this is just
two or three months

687
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,667
after the Allies are able
to capture Berlin.

688
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,999
And it's really the Russian army
that is now controlling it.

689
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,999
It will be eventually
divided up into four sectors.

690
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:08,999
But you also see
this presidential car

691
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,875
outside multiple
public buildings

692
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,999
that the U.S. public
would've recognized

693
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:16,709
from the Third Reich
and from Hitler.

694
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:17,542
And so these images,

695
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,417
like the ones that
we see on the screen,

696
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:22,999
yes, they are shown
over news reels,

697
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,999
but they're also displayed

698
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:27,917
in various magazines
such as<i>LIFE.</i>

699
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:30,709
And so there are these images
that the public can see

700
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:34,999
and understand that
even though the war is over,

701
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,208
we need to take
a leadership role.

702
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:39,458
And part of that is seeing
the president in these places

703
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,000
exerting American power
and influence.

704
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,999
- Interesting you should
mention<i>LIFE,</i>the magazine,

705
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:49,750
because there really hasn't
been anything like it since

706
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,959
in terms of a real focus
for this week in the world

707
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,875
and the huge,
full-page pictures.

708
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:02,583
- Yes, yes, and it really is,
not only is it a focus

709
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,458
on what's going on in the world
in these images,

710
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:10,583
but is in some ways, a visual...

711
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,709
There's a visual similarity

712
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,000
between what FDR would do
in his fireside chats

713
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,999
and how these images that
<i>LIFE</i>would portray.

714
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,291
For example,
throughout the Cold War,

715
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,625
there were these weekly columns
about where the president was

716
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:29,333
and what the president was doing
and the images attached to it.

717
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:29,999
And so in some ways,

718
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,583
although it's not a form
of direct presidential address

719
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:35,208
in the way that FDR would
speak directly to the people,

720
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:39,125
it was a way for a U.S. public,
even those who couldn't read.

721
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,792
You can imagine children
leafing through these magazines

722
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,291
on the coffee table,
of seeing the president

723
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,750
and what they were doing
in the world

724
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,834
and how that was associated

725
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:50,041
with the spread of American
power and influence.

726
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,999
- Yeah, so the Potsdam pictures
are very effective

727
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:56,041
because on the one hand, the
destruction of the Third Reich,

728
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,959
you know,
the buildings that you see

729
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:01,291
destroyed by American bombing
and Soviet too.

730
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:04,834
And on the other hand,
there's the president coming in

731
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,792
and in a sense,
kind of reassuring the world

732
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:12,917
that there will be a
continuation and a rebuilding.

733
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:13,792
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,709
- And an interesting transition
when we get to,

735
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:20,250
in the use of the media
in particular and rhetoric,

736
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,999
is when we go from Truman
to Eisenhower in 1953.

737
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,041
Of course, Eisenhower,
in many ways,

738
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,999
one of the handful of people
who saved the whole thing,

739
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:34,542
the D-Day invasion on his
shoulders and all of that,

740
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:38,834
and very much a respected man.

741
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:42,375
And the war is over though,

742
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,166
certainly by the time
he gets to 1953.

743
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,792
Even the Korean War is over

744
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,208
by the time Eisenhower
is president.

745
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:51,999
And so what does
he see as his role

746
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:56,083
in pitching America
to the world?

747
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,333
- Well, one of the things
that we have to recognize

748
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,250
in this transition
between Truman and Eisenhower,

749
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,999
yes, it's the end
of World War II,

750
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,709
but we also have the
beginning of the Cold War.

751
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:08,959
And historians will
generally pinpoint

752
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,125
that moment in 1946 or 1947.

753
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,458
There's a number of things
that happened,

754
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:16,458
but one of them is in 1947
when Truman will deliver

755
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,999
what is now known as the
Truman Doctrine speech,

756
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,125
essentially making the case

757
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:24,333
that just as the United States
had a moral obligation

758
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,583
to take this leadership role
in the world

759
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:32,417
to defeat Nazi Germany, now too,
do we have a moral obligation

760
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:34,417
to continue that role
of leadership

761
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:38,999
as the Soviet Union attempts
to spread throughout Europe.

762
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,999
And so the impetus
for that speech

763
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,999
is really the fact
that Greece and Turkey

764
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:48,333
will no longer receive aid
from Great Britain

765
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,999
because of the
economic collapse,

766
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,458
essentially, following
the Second World War.

767
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:56,542
But that idea quickly spreads
to this broader vision

768
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:59,083
of U.S. leadership,
economic and military aid,

769
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,000
and presence abroad
as the Cold War heats up.

770
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,041
And so, although the Cold War

771
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:07,500
is not necessarily
a military contest;

772
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,999
sometimes it is,
and we can talk about that.

773
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:15,208
But Eisenhower really is going
to weaponize the Cold War

774
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,667
through strategic propaganda
means.

775
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:19,417
And what I mean by that

776
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,667
is that he is going to create
various offices,

777
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,458
both in the State Department
and in the White House,

778
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:29,291
that are going to be responsible
for projecting an image

779
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,875
of the United States
to audiences around the world.

780
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,999
So for Eisenhower, it's not
just that we're gonna send

781
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:36,917
military or economic aid,
we're also going to teach

782
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,208
other people around the world
about the United States,

783
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,792
about the principles
of democracy.

784
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:44,999
And he sees his job, obviously
to keep us out of a hot war.

785
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:45,999
He doesn't want that again,

786
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:51,250
but also to make this really
determined propaganda campaign

787
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,999
to sell the merits of democracy

788
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:57,999
to what are often referred to
as the non-aligned nations.

789
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,999
So we begin to see
this bifurcation of,

790
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,291
are you with the Soviet Union?

791
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,333
- Yes.
- Or the United States.

792
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:06,333
- And Latin America, of course,
is a big part of that.

793
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:11,041
- Absolutely, and this idea
that Eisenhower wants to ensure

794
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,333
that specifically
in Latin America

795
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,166
and South America
and various hemispheres.

796
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,000
We can also talk about India,
for example,

797
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,250
and how important
that is in Asia.

798
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,750
Eisenhower sees his role
is to ensure

799
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,250
that those nations
align themselves

800
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,999
with the United States
and not the Soviet Union.

801
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:28,667
- And that they see this,

802
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,667
at least by the look
of the image

803
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:34,583
that we have up now
of Eisenhower in Uruguay,

804
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:40,999
that we see him as the happy,
friendly representative

805
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,999
of the United States
and democracy.

806
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:43,750
- Allison: Absolutely.

807
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,333
And the thing that's really
unique about this image,

808
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,709
so this is from Eisenhower's
goodwill tour in South America

809
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,166
in Uruguay in 1960.

810
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,999
One of the things
that Eisenhower does

811
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,999
is he undertakes
three goodwill tours.

812
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,166
He's gonna do one
that goes to Europe

813
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,709
and North Africa and India.

814
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:00,999
One is gonna go to South America

815
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:03,333
and then one is going to go
to Asia.

816
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,250
And through these three tours,
essentially,

817
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,834
Eisenhower is attempting
to project the presence

818
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,208
of the president and to argue

819
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,000
that you should really
align yourselves with us.

820
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,166
There's deep and intensive focus
on the media coverage.

821
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,750
They will bring their
own representatives

822
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,999
from the State Department
and the White House to make sure

823
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:23,250
that they photograph
and capture all of these images.

824
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,999
And at this point now,
footage for news reels

825
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:28,000
that can be sent back
to the United States.

826
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,625
- Well, speaking
of rhetoric though,

827
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,875
how is Ike as a speaker?

828
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,709
- You know, what's
interesting about Eisenhower

829
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:34,999
is that if you watch
his speeches

830
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:38,917
or listen to his speeches,
you can see someone

831
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:42,125
who is very disciplined
as a military strategist.

832
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,125
He's very direct,
he's very to the point.

833
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,458
And in some ways,
it seems quite uninteresting

834
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,999
because there's not a ton
of rhetorical flourish.

835
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,999
- It's control.
- Yeah, absolutely,

836
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,999
it's control
and it's discipline.

837
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,750
However, that for a long time

838
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,667
people would make critiques
of Eisenhower

839
00:39:56,667 --> 00:40:00,875
as a public speaker and say,
"There's not much there."

840
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,375
However, I would argue
that the decisions

841
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,417
that Eisenhower made
while in office,

842
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,375
whether he was public
about those

843
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,458
or more private; for example,

844
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,500
creating the United States
Information Agency

845
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,250
or various organizations
designed to project this image

846
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,999
of the United States, his
decisions would forever change

847
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,667
how we think about public
diplomacy, as we call it today.

848
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,500
- Really, what kind of decisions
would those be

849
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,999
that would come out
in these goodwill tours?

850
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,875
- Well, so, for example,
one of the things

851
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,999
that Eisenhower did,
is he created offices

852
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:33,875
both in the White House
and the State Department,

853
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:38,041
whose explicit goal
was to steady the attitudes

854
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,125
and public opinions of citizens

855
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,125
living in these non-aligned
countries around the world.

856
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,291
And then to report back
to the State Department

857
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:47,000
and the White House
what these attitudes were.

858
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,500
Now, obviously, in terms
of scientific accuracy,

859
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,667
these were public opinion
surveys taken by people

860
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,125
who wanted a very
specific response.

861
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,250
But still, they would take
these public opinion surveys

862
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,333
and they would send reports
back to the White House.

863
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,750
And so then for example,
when Eisenhower's preparing

864
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,041
to go to Uruguay
or Brazil or Chile

865
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:07,999
or any of these countries
on this tour,

866
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,333
they would give
him talking points

867
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,125
to reach very
particular audiences.

868
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:14,458
And we think of that
as an assumption

869
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,917
that happens now today.

870
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:17,667
But Eisenhower is deliberate

871
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:21,500
with military precision
in making sure that he knows

872
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,917
exactly how to reach
different audiences

873
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:27,667
and cater to what they want
to hear to make an argument

874
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,208
for why they should
align themselves

875
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,333
with the United States.

876
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,417
- We had that image earlier

877
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:35,999
of Truman in Potsdam
right near Berlin.

878
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:39,667
And Berlin seemed then
to become, at that point,

879
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:44,999
kind of a sounding board
for presidents to follow,

880
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:48,999
most famously JFK.
- Yes.

881
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,667
- What does the
significance of Berlin

882
00:41:51,667 --> 00:42:00,417
and how did JFK work it
into his foreign policy?

883
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,291
- Well, as you noted,
we see this image

884
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,999
of Truman driving
through Berlin.

885
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:06,458
And we have to remember
that for four years

886
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,250
of U.S. involvement
in World War II,

887
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,834
Berlin is the capital
of the Nazi regime, right?

888
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:13,999
It is this space

889
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,625
that is really synonymous
with evil under Hitler.

890
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:21,999
But one of the things that
happens following World War II

891
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:23,959
and the Allied victory

892
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:28,291
is that Berlin becomes this
symbol of democratic resolve.

893
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:31,542
Part of that has to do with
the fact that after Potsdam,

894
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:35,458
Berlin is divided
into four zones of occupation.

895
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:38,291
And shortly thereafter,
one of the things

896
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:42,583
that doesn't happen at Potsdam
is the Big Three,

897
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:45,999
so Great Britain, the United
States, the Soviet Union,

898
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:48,000
and then France
comes and joins them.

899
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,250
They don't really work out
the zones of access

900
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,999
of how you're going to get
supplies in and out of the city

901
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:57,999
because they're smack dab in
Soviet-controlled East Germany.

902
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:01,375
- Enter the Berlin airlift.
- Exactly, the Berlin airlift.

903
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:06,999
And so you see then
British and American planes

904
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:08,999
flying coal and water

905
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,625
and food and medical supplies
to ensure

906
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,250
that this entire country--

907
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,333
excuse me, this entire city
does not starve to death.

908
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,750
And Berlin quickly
becomes a symbol.

909
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,625
And you begin to hear language
used to describe Berlin

910
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,999
as this island of freedom.

911
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:26,542
And JFK will invoke that phrase

912
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:29,250
when he goes to Berlin
in June of 1963,

913
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,333
and essentially make the
argument to his audience,

914
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:36,208
both in West Berlin,
but also recognizing

915
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,959
that this is being broadcast
in the United States

916
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:43,417
and around the world, that West
Berlin is not just something

917
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:48,375
that is a symbol to Germans
or to Europe.

918
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,208
But as he will say,

919
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,875
and famously identify himself
with Berlin,

920
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,917
that we are all a part of Berlin

921
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,083
because of what
Berlin symbolizes.

922
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:58,999
- And he is talking
specifically here

923
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:00,750
in Cold War terms.

924
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,250
- Absolutely.

925
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:07,250
[crowd applauding and cheering]

926
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:15,500
- You live in a defended island
of freedom,

927
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,250
but your life is
part of the main.

928
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:22,583
So let me ask you, as I close,

929
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:26,750
to lift your eyes beyond
the dangers of today,

930
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,250
to the hopes of tomorrow,

931
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:33,333
beyond the freedom merely
of this city of Berlin

932
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,999
or your country of Germany,

933
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:39,417
to the advance of freedom
everywhere.

934
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:41,875
Beyond the wall,

935
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,500
to the day of peace
with justice.

936
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,834
Beyond yourselves and ourselves,
to all mankind.

937
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,458
Freedom is indivisible.

938
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:59,041
And when one man is enslaved,
all are not free.

939
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:04,792
When all are free, then we look
and look forward to that day

940
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:09,208
when this city will be joined
as one and this country.

941
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,166
And this great continent
of Europe

942
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:15,083
in a peaceful and hopeful globe.

943
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:19,667
When that day finally comes,
as it will,

944
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:25,041
the people of West Berlin
can take sober satisfaction

945
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:29,250
in the fact that they
were in the front lines

946
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,917
for almost two decades.

947
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:36,375
[crowd cheering and applauding]

948
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,375
All...

949
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:53,583
All free men,
wherever they may live,

950
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:56,166
are citizens of Berlin.

951
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:59,999
And therefore, as a free man,

952
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:06,250
I take pride in the words,
"Ich bin ein Berliner."

953
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:11,375
[crowd cheering and applauding]

954
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:32,000
- Well, John F. Kennedy
had one advantage

955
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,083
over some of his predecessors

956
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,375
in terms of what I'll call
loosely presidential rhetoric.

957
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:40,291
And that is he was a
terribly handsome, charming,

958
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:46,250
charismatic, well-traveled man.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

959
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,625
His successor, however,

960
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,166
Lyndon B. Johnson,
very different kind of guy.

961
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,959
In fact,
front page of the paper,

962
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:58,291
as soon as LBJ is sworn in,
different kind of guy.

963
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,999
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

964
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:02,125
- But as a traveler abroad,

965
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:07,792
LBJ had one overriding issue
during his whole time in office.

966
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:08,917
And that was Vietnam.

967
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,999
- Absolutely.
- How did he handle Vietnam

968
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:16,375
as a matter of presidential
rhetoric or imaging?

969
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:21,458
- Well, LBJ, first of all,
understands

970
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:25,125
just how significant the
United States' involvement

971
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:25,875
in Vietnam is.

972
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:29,834
And he's the one that famously
will escalate mass troops

973
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:33,166
and troop escalation
into Vietnam.

974
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,834
But he also was
inheriting something

975
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:37,834
that Kennedy had
been involved in.

976
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:41,041
And again,
similar from FDR to Truman,

977
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:45,375
Johnson is not necessarily
expecting to be president,

978
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:45,999
but there he is,

979
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:48,999
and he has this thing that
he needs to deal with.

980
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,625
I will say that for Johnson,

981
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:54,834
one of the things that he does
try to do is to articulate

982
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:58,500
both the United States' support
for South Vietnam.

983
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,917
It's important to note
that the United States

984
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:05,000
is going to portray
what will come to be known

985
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,250
as the Vietnam War as again,
not just something

986
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,875
that concerns the Vietnamese
people or Asia more broadly,

987
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,375
but this idea that,
he will make comparisons

988
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,250
talking about that

989
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,999
just as West Berlin
is this symbol in Europe,

990
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,625
Vietnam is this symbol

991
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:24,709
of whether democracy will
prevail or not in Asia.

992
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:26,999
So he makes two tours
to Vietnam,

993
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,999
one in 1966 and one in 1967.

994
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:32,083
We have an image of that here.

995
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:35,875
And he greets U.S. troops
and talks to them

996
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:39,041
and really attempts
to articulate why their mission

997
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,959
is so critical in a Cold War
global consciousness

998
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:47,375
and the role that the United
States will take in the world.

999
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,166
- Sort of the back door

1000
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:54,667
to solving the whole Vietnam
War problem though, is China.

1001
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:55,000
- Yes.

1002
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,208
- And when Richard Nixon
plays the China card,

1003
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:01,999
recognizes China,
he goes to Beijing.

1004
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:06,583
And that in itself has to
have been just a huge symbol.

1005
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:07,041
- Absolutely.

1006
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:10,125
I mean, there's the saying,
only Nixon could go to China.

1007
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,583
And so Nixon,
you have to remember

1008
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,250
as vice president
for Eisenhower,

1009
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,000
he really is quite vocal
about his concern

1010
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,208
over what he will call Red China
or Communist China.

1011
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:27,999
But Nixon will turn around,
he will see, as you noted,

1012
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,125
that not just in thinking about
Vietnam, but more broadly

1013
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,208
the relationship
with the Soviet Union

1014
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:34,999
and how the United States can
really gain the upper hand,

1015
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:36,917
is that if we can
form a relationship

1016
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:38,083
with the
People's Republic of China,

1017
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,000
if we can overlook the things

1018
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,166
that we've been saying
about them for so long,

1019
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:46,792
perhaps maybe we can begin
to exert power and influence.

1020
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:47,834
So when Nixon goes to China,

1021
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:50,458
he makes the announcement
in July of 1971,

1022
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:53,125
and then makes the
actual trip in 1972,

1023
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,458
it sends shockwaves
around the world.

1024
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:58,792
And the Nixon White House is
quite explicit about the images

1025
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:00,834
that they want to show
and portray.

1026
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,834
There's a famous image,
for example,

1027
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:07,250
of Nixon and his wife,
Pat Nixon, at the Great Wall.

1028
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,667
You have images of him
descending from Air Force One

1029
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:14,375
on the plane to the
People's Republic of China.

1030
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:17,667
You have various state banquets,
for example,

1031
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:18,750
and you have the Chinese flag

1032
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,709
and the American flag, which
have never been shown together

1033
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:27,041
simultaneously in a particular
way that evokes friendship

1034
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:31,166
or kinship in this particular
way, but Nixon does it.

1035
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,208
And this is the reason

1036
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,417
that when we think about
Nixon's foreign policy,

1037
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:36,999
we do think about Vietnam.

1038
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:38,999
And we also do
think about China.

1039
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,291
- Well, another place,
we mentioned Berlin,

1040
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:43,583
but another place that has
become one of those go-to places

1041
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,667
for presidents at
certain intervals is Normandy.

1042
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:50,792
- Absolutely, and specifically
thinking about anniversaries

1043
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,458
of D-Day and Normandy.

1044
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,999
So for example, Reagan in 1984

1045
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:58,166
goes and delivers what
many historians consider

1046
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:00,083
one of his best
presidential speeches.

1047
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:01,999
And he'll commemorate
the 40th anniversary

1048
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:05,500
of D-Day at Pointe du Hoc,
and he'll talk directly

1049
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,999
to some of the U.S. Army Rangers

1050
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,625
who scaled the cliffs
that are behind him.

1051
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,999
So in this image, you can see

1052
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,667
the Rangers are on either side
of him

1053
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:17,291
in this horseshoe formation
and the cliffs are behind him.

1054
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,291
And it's really a tradition

1055
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,834
that presidents have
followed since Reagan

1056
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:25,333
and almost is viewed as this
presidential rite of passage.

1057
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,125
- What would you say would be
kind of the most dynamic,

1058
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:34,375
most direct, even blunt speech
of Reagan during the Cold War?

1059
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,999
- Well, I think most people
would agree

1060
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:38,417
that it is Reagan's decision

1061
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:43,125
to call out, "Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall."

1062
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:47,208
It's this moment in 1987 when
Reagan goes back to Berlin,

1063
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:49,999
as many presidents have,
he's going to stand

1064
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:52,999
in front of the Brandenburg
Gate, really the symbol

1065
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,834
of German unification
at one point,

1066
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:56,999
but now this symbol
of German division.

1067
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:59,792
And he's going to call
quite explicitly

1068
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:04,500
for Mr. Gorbachev
to tear down this wall.

1069
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,999
- There is one sign
that the Soviets can make

1070
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:12,625
that would be unmistakable,
that would advance dramatically

1071
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,875
the cause of freedom and peace.

1072
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:21,333
General Secretary Gorbachev,
if you seek peace,

1073
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:22,709
if you seek prosperity

1074
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:25,750
for the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe,

1075
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:31,125
if you seek liberalization,
come here to this gate.

1076
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:35,625
Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

1077
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,333
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1078
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:56,250
Mr. Gorbachev...

1079
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:04,417
Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.

1080
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,250
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1081
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:21,625
- And he did.
- And he did.

1082
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:24,166
- How big a part
of that decision

1083
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:28,542
on Gorbachev's part do you think
was prompted by this speech?

1084
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:32,208
What kind of world reaction
came out of it?

1085
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,792
- Well, you asked me
a question earlier

1086
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:36,458
about the role of speech writers
in writing these speeches.

1087
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,291
And it's fascinating
to look at Peter Robinson,

1088
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:41,792
who was one of the primary
speech writers of this speech,

1089
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,041
who talks about the back
and forth between Reagan

1090
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,999
and the State Department
leading up to this speech.

1091
00:53:46,999 --> 00:53:48,542
Reagan desperately
wanted that line,

1092
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,999
"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down
this wall," in the speech,

1093
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:52,875
and they would send drafts
back and forth

1094
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,125
from the White House
to the State Department.

1095
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,999
And every time, the State
Department would take it out.

1096
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:57,667
- Norman: Why?

1097
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,542
- They thought it was
gonna be too provocative.

1098
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:01,208
They thought it was
gonna be too direct.

1099
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:04,333
They thought it was
going to be an expression

1100
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,041
of an American president

1101
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,333
trying to exert his will
on another country.

1102
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:09,959
- It was, which it was.
- It was, it was,

1103
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:11,333
but Reagan was deliberate.

1104
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,999
And so, you know,
we can't know exactly

1105
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:18,959
how much this speech contributed
to the tearing down of the wall,

1106
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:23,999
but we do know that
Reagan's economic policies

1107
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,583
and Reagan's deliberate attempts
to be quite clear

1108
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,917
about what he saw
as the evils of communism

1109
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:31,999
did lead to a shift
in public opinion

1110
00:54:31,999 --> 00:54:37,792
and did lead to the dissolution
of the Soviet Union.

1111
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:42,417
- Which was already, the
wheels were starting to turn.

1112
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:45,625
I mean, Gorbachev the most,
I'll say liberal.

1113
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:48,917
- Yes.
- Soviet leader by far.

1114
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,041
- Yes, yes.
- And so Reagan

1115
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,999
must have known that he was
talking to the right person

1116
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,000
if it was ever going to happen.

1117
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,583
- Absolutely, and these are
the quandaries of history,

1118
00:54:58,583 --> 00:54:59,417
right, of how do we know

1119
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:02,999
what contributed to what
eventually happened?

1120
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,667
But I can say that
as a president,

1121
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,000
Reagan was able
to articulate clear

1122
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and compelling language arguing
against the Soviet Union

1123
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,166
in ways that presidents
before him had not done.

1124
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,999
- And put a good deal
of his personality,

1125
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:19,750
and I suspect his
professional background

1126
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,792
as an actor into it
also didn't hurt

1127
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:22,999
if you're talking
about rhetoric.

1128
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:25,583
- Absolutely.
- Which we have been doing

1129
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:26,959
for this conversation.

1130
00:55:26,959 --> 00:55:29,125
Allison Prasch,
it's been a great pleasure.

1131
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,041
- Thank you so much
for having me.

1132
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:34,083
- I'm Norman Gilliland; I hope
you'll join me next time around
