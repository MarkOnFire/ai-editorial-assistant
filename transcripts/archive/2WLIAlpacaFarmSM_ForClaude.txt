- Kerri Harting: When people
drive onto the farm,

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,014
there is something magical.

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,717
If I wouldn't have the farm...

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,719
Do you wanna give me a kiss?

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,122
... I know I wouldn't be the
person that I am today.

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,626
I'm Kerri, and I'm the owner
of Eagle Eye Farm.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,728
I was working as a radiologist
in St. Louis, Missouri,

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,464
and Dawn, my wife, had been
working in health care

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,065
for about 32 years.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:36,136
And we just decided that the
monotony was too much for us.

12
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,207
In August of 2018,
we went to an alpaca farm.

13
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:46,113
We had just wanted to go do
something fun with the kids.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,381
It was pretty shortly
after that,

15
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,782
I'm talking like a day or two,

16
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:53,086
that Dawn and I decided
we wanted to get into alpacas.

17
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,389
[bright acoustic music]

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,027
We're right between Hudson,
Prescott, and River Falls

19
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,295
in western Wisconsin.

20
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,030
It's a great area.

21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,770
So we had 20 alpacas,
we had 2 pigs,

22
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:13,106
and we had chickens.
[chicken clucking]

23
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,809
We brought in the
Valais Blacknose sheep.

24
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,011
We also purchased two llamas.

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,179
We added goats,

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,349
and then we added
prehensile-tailed porcupines.

27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,052
And then you have to have
the Highland cattle

28
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,988
because they have
the gorgeous horns.

29
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,325
Dawn had always known that she
had wanted to do agrotourism.

30
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,126
Agrotourism is simply the act

31
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,561
of having people come
to your property

32
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,997
and showing them
about agriculture.

33
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,565
So Dawn was very adamant

34
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,668
that she wanted people to know
where food came from.

35
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,404
We do not eat any of our animals
that we have here,

36
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,039
but she wants kids to know

37
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,041
that you don't just go
to the grocery store

38
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,610
and pick up your food
from there.

39
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:54,815
There's really a whole process
that happens before that.

40
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:58,018
I think everything just kind of,
just fell into our lap.

41
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,221
It was just as if
it was meant to be.

42
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,225
[pig snorting]

43
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,471
In 2023, Dawn was at an
alpaca show in Michigan.

44
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,508
She told me when she was there
that she wasn't feeling well.

45
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,144
The feeling did not go away.

46
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,981
And I just said, "So I'm gonna
meet you at Hudson Physicians,"

47
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,483
and she said, "Okay."

48
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,787
And at that point, I knew that
I was in trouble.

49
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,458
They determined that
she was having a heart problem.

50
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,095
Ended up eventually at the
university on life support.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,398
Was on life support
for three and a half weeks,

52
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,400
and then passed away.

53
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,976
This farm was really hers.

54
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,779
So she was in charge
of all of the animal care,

55
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,415
taking care of the animals
day by day.

56
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,816
I would take care
of the finances,

57
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,218
I would take care
of the website,

58
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,053
I would take care of the store.

59
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,955
And she did everything else.

60
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,092
And so then, we're stuck with,
I've lost my wife,

61
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,761
I've lost my best friend,
I've lost my business partner.

62
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,731
I am like, "What am I going
to do?"

63
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,934
So I have two kids,
I have the farm,

64
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,136
I'm still working full time.

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,206
How am I gonna manage
all of this?

66
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,544
I looked at downsizing,
and really,

67
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,947
the only decision that made
any sense was to stay here.

68
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,315
There you go, bud.

69
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,950
C'mon, let's go get some food.

70
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,553
I knew that my time here
wasn't done.

71
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,655
I still have a purpose here
on the farm,

72
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,091
and I wanted to make it work.

73
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,359
[laughing]

74
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,862
It's the best decision
that I've ever made.

75
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,397
I'm still in the
grieving process.

76
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,966
It's been a year and a half,
almost two years.

77
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,303
It's, I don't like to think
about it a lot,

78
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,672
so I just keep myself busy.

79
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,179
What I do is I wake up somewhere
between 5:30 and 6:00,

80
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,548
and I have two kangaroos
that live in the house,

81
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,249
and so I feed them.

82
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,251
By 7:30, we're out here
doing chores.

83
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,953
So we pick up all of the poop.

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,755
You have to make sure
that they have food,

85
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,757
so we give our alpacas pellets.

86
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,661
They have free choice hay, so
we have to refresh their hay.

87
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,329
And then, of course,
fresh water.

88
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,931
[water splashing]

89
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,465
And so, the chores take anywhere

90
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,435
from two, two and a half
to three hours to do.

91
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,970
We do them as a group.

92
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,272
Hopefully, we start having some
visitors that come

93
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,941
and we start doing tours.

94
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,910
And so yeah,
it stays pretty busy.

95
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,848
I could not do this
without my staff.

96
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,017
So I have really great staff
that work here

97
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,320
that I trust immensely.

98
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,422
I am so appreciative
for the fact

99
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,458
that they're supportive of me.

100
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,427
You know,
I can't see myself moving.

101
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,595
I just honestly can't.

102
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,563
You know, I think I'll probably
be here

103
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,866
until I'm no longer here
on Earth.

104
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,970
I truly enjoy the experience
of having people around me.

105
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,972
I love the animals.

106
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,241
I find this very fulfilling.

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,210
[laughing]
That's good video!

108
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,513
It's all about love.

109
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,850
It's all about caring for each
other and caring for nature,

110
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,519
and really doing the best
that we can

111
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,722
for people and animals
and the Earth.
