1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,137
- We're on the trails
at Interstate Park,

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,572
on the hunt to learn more

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,544
about how the Ice Age shaped
this layered landscape.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,648
To do that,

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,318
Natural Resource Property
Supervisor Matthew Densow

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,088
met me in the Ice Age
Interpretive Center.

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,289
- Matthew Densow:
So, Interstate Park

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,258
is a very, very unique property
in that

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,194
we are the oldest property
in the state of Wisconsin.

10
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,595
We have over 1,300 acres,

11
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,197
and our major feature
that we protect

12
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,732
are the Dalles
at the Saint Croix

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,568
and the glacial potholes
that we have here.

14
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:38,338
We have 82 standard campsites
along with 2 group campsites.

15
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,107
We have a very nice
swimming beach

16
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,508
that's on the
Lake O' the Dalles.

17
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,278
We have over nine miles
of hiking trail within the park.

18
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,779
With the Ice Age
Interpretive Center,

19
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,915
it allows people to kind of
travel back in time

20
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,484
and experience what the area
really kind of looked like,

21
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,719
and then physically going
on the pothole trails,

22
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,856
imagining where the water was
and how the potholes formed

23
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,425
really kind of helps people
transport back in time.

24
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,929
So there's lots to see and do
here at Interstate.

25
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,263
- So, I understand

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,999
there are technically
two Interstate Parks.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,734
- So there is a
Wisconsin Interstate

28
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,503
and then there's a
Minnesota Interstate Park.

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,838
So we're the bigger, better one.

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,173
You know, we have more to offer,
more to see and do.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,508
There are some differences.

32
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,343
They're definitely both
good properties to go and visit,

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,545
but I'm gonna definitely
advocate for our side.

34
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,080
- I'm all
for friendly competition,

35
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,149
so encouraging everyone
to get outdoors,

36
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,252
and they can option
into the Interstate Park

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,486
on the Wisconsin side,

38
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,088
but clarifying
the Interstate State Park

39
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,623
is on the Minnesota side.
- Correct.

40
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,525
- See both, but come here first.

41
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,860
- Exactly.
- Okay. [both laughing]

42
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,295
Thanks, Matthew.
- Thanks.

43
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,530
- Angela: So I understand

44
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,165
there's a unique anniversary
taking place this year,

45
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,200
the 125th year of the park.

46
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,802
Can you tell us about that?
- Definitely.

47
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,137
In September 20 of 1900,

48
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,073
the first parcels of land
were purchased here

49
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,407
for Interstate Park.

50
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,144
So this year is the 125th
anniversary of Interstate Park,

51
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,447
but also the entire
Wisconsin state park system,

52
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,650
which has grown from Interstate
to 50 state parks,

53
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,285
fifteen state forests.

54
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,755
Fourty-four state trails,
nine recreation areas,

55
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,757
eight water resource areas,

56
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,628
over 6,000 campsites,
1,500 buildings.

57
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,697
It's grown
to what you see today.

58
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,333
- Would you mind showing me
some more about the park?

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,501
- Yeah, definitely.

60
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,970
Let's go for a nice little hike.

61
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,673
- Angela: From the center,
we headed to the Pothole Trail

62
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,176
to get a look at the
ancient rock formations

63
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,911
this park offers.

64
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,612
- Matthew: So,
if you can imagine

65
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,248
when everything was melting
with the last glaciation,

66
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,516
there's a whole bunch of water

67
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,019
that was coming
through this area.

68
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,921
Water was coming through
really fast,

69
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,523
and there's lots of things
that got caught in the water.

70
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,426
Some of the ones that we find
are called grinders.

71
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,428
- Oh, wow.
- And this is a small example

72
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,863
of one that we have here.

73
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,432
Well, you get a whirlpool
that forms, and then it drills

74
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,201
into the rock itself.
- Oh!

75
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,469
- And that's how we form
glacial potholes,

76
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,740
which we have very fine examples
here at Interstate Park.

77
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,009
So one thing that
makes potholes special,

78
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,411
and you can tell it's a pothole,

79
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,112
is that the surface inside
is smooth

80
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,548
because you can tell
that it's been worn out.

81
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,017
- I now have a more positive
association with potholes

82
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,053
than what I came into this
conversation with.

83
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,221
- Great.

84
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,823
It's a fun feature, isn't it?
- Absolutely.

85
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,359
Something I never thought
I'd say,

86
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,729
I have a newfound admiration
for potholes.

87
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,564
- So, this is the Dalles.

88
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:21,134
- Angela: And for the majestic
views found at Interstate Park,

89
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,103
on the Wisconsin side.
