[gentle music]

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,440
- Angela Fitzgerald: It's a
sunny fall day

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,742
on this rural Verona farm.

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,914
Juan Gonzalez is
pulling up the papalo.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,518
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,052
- Angela: And picking
the purslane.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,388
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,223
- Angela: These herbs are not
typically grown

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,528
in Wisconsin farms,
making them hard to find.

10
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,796
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,266
- Angela: But for Mexican
immigrants like Juan,

12
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,736
they are a taste of home,
especially for those

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,738
from the state of Puebla.

14
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,806
- [speaking Spanish]

15
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,448
- Angela: To get to the point
where Juan is today,

16
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,119
growing herbs for himself
and others, has been a journey.

17
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,288
From the rancho where
he was raised

18
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,224
to the farm fields of the West.

19
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,528
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

20
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:09,203
- Angela: To a chance encounter
on a Madison city bus

21
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,405
more than 20 years ago.

22
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,675
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

23
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:50,277
- Angela: But to grow from hobby
gardener to full-time farmer

24
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:54,581
would take time, and an
unlikely friendship.

25
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,251
Juan told the community
garden director

26
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,586
he sought larger fields
to grow more.

27
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,222
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

28
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,603
- Linda and Gene Farley
lived on this land.

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,272
They were radically
generous people

30
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,241
who opened up their home
and their property

31
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,411
to farmers who were
looking for space to grow.

32
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,914
- Angela: Gene and Linda Farley
spent their first years

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,583
after med school together
tending to the needs

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,619
of the Navajo in the Southwest.

35
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,922
Then they brought their
spirit of public service

36
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,557
to southern Wisconsin.

37
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,426
Eventually, they met Juan.

38
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,261
- He knew Linda and Gene

39
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,264
before our program
and organization was started,

40
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,434
and he worked with Gene
to develop the incubator farm,

41
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,370
what would become
our collaborative farm.

42
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,073
- Angela: Today, the Farleys'
farm continues

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,644
what was started with Juan,
a path to agriculture production

44
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,080
for dedicated newcomers.

45
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,684
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

46
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,424
- Angela: Like Juan, many of the
aspiring farmers

47
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,825
have been immigrants.

48
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:15,729
- People have come from all
over, many from Latin America,

49
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,833
as well as a lot of people from
Southeast Asia and West Africa.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,169
- Angela: Many more
come on tours.

51
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,404
They learn about
the farmer program

52
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:29,943
and the organic and sustainable
practices the farm employs.

53
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,547
Through a translator, Juan talks
about his specialty crops.

54
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,249
- But then, you also have, like,
purslane...

55
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,918
- Angela: The number
of familiar plants from home

56
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,786
Juan has brought to Wisconsin

57
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,956
has added new flavor
to the community.

58
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,025
- [speaking Spanish]

59
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,073
- Angela: El Sabor de Puebla,
literally "the flavor of Puebla"

60
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,243
is the restaurant
owned by Juan's sister.

61
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,812
She's a big customer
for his produce,

62
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,448
including flowers that
will decorate the ofrenda

63
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,616
in the lobby.

64
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,252
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

65
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,723
- Angela: On Halloween Day

66
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,560
at the Centro Hispano
Farmers' Market,

67
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,763
Juan's vegetable stand
has plenty of marigolds

68
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,600
for use the next day,
the Day of the Dead.

69
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,336
Flowers and other tributes
will fill these

70
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,673
altars of remembrance
to those now gone.

71
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,442
And in the highest perch
of honor at the restaurant

72
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,744
are the Doctors Farley.

73
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,747
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,836
- Angela: No doubt Los Abuelos
Farley would be happy

75
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,173
with all their farm
has provided.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,809
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,288
