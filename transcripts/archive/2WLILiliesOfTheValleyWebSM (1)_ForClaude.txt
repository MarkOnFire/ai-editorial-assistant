00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,210
- Nancy Jorgensen:
It was May 1977

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,712
when my grandmother, Nana,

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,148
led me to her basement,
past the black iron cookstove,

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,218
then the shelves
of home-canned beans and beets.

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,954
I sniffed the stale scent
of Wisconsin wood fires

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,357
and the mustiness of potatoes
in storage,

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,426
odors familiar to me
since childhood.

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,995
"Come see the lilies,"
Nana said,

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,930
as she leaned
the screen door open

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:34,368
and planted one leather shoe
into her shady backyard.

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,236
I was 22 and just married,

13
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:39,039
but Nana's gardens
still felt like home.

14
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,674
"Bring that shovel," she said.

15
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,943
"We'll dig some
for your new house."

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,212
Nana cultivated
other species too.

17
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,981
Phlox, daffodils,
violets, pansies.

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,350
She coaxed each
into a vibrant melody

19
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,986
until her country yard
trilled with color.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,621
Every year a new song,

21
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,825
but her refrain always
lilies of the valley.

22
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,261
Four decades later,

23
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,764
Nana's darlings transform
my spring landscape

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,601
from a dirt and grass hoedown
to a frothy white minuet.

25
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,469
Nana has been gone many years,

26
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,773
but her lilies still sing
and sway.

27
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,109
Nurseries call them
a high-maintenance plant,

28
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,712
but Nana considered
their spreading a virtue.

29
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,950
Their duty in life, like hers,
to place roots, scatter beauty,

30
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,320
and pass gifts on
to a new generation.

31
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,789
Lilies of the valley thrive
in shade.

32
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:32,159
As a woman of the 1920s,
so did Nana.

33
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:36,263
Her list of chores
cast long shadows over each day.

34
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,833
Wife and mother was not
her first choice of vocation.

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,235
Many years earlier,

36
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,972
she dreamed of an education
and a life devoted to healing.

37
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,908
"I always wanted to be a nurse,"
she said.

38
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,677
Instead, she lived,
like neighboring farm wives,

39
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,246
in her husband's shadow,

40
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,116
reflecting warmth and light
toward him.

41
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,553
Like Nana,
lilies of the valley rise early

42
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,855
and bloom in the dawn of summer.

43
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,424
Slender columns strut low
to the ground,

44
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,261
each boasting
up to a dozen tiny flowers.

45
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,497
Pure white,
only millimeters across.

46
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,534
Lilies of the valley
symbolize rebirth, purity,

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,736
youth, and happiness.

48
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,072
But Nana delivered them
to the grave of her son,

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,241
a sailor in the U.S. Navy,

50
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,778
and later her husband,
who died at only 59.

51
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,482
And then another son,
whose heart suddenly gave out.

52
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,120
In life's valleys,
her lilies intoned a requiem.

53
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,022
My 30-something daughters

54
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,357
inherited Nana's love
of gardening.

55
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:41,528
Gwen, a professional athlete,
sows kale, plants parsley,

56
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,931
and nurtures her bed of mint.

57
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,533
Elizabeth buys seedlings
from her high school students,

58
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,702
who grow them in biology.

59
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,138
For my daughters,
planting is play.

60
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,773
The stakes are low.

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,676
If their gardens produce,
they make a caprese salad

62
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,745
or add chives to lettuce
from the farmer's market.

63
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,949
They have none of Nana's worries
about climate's uncontrollables,

64
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,618
like rain, sun, drought,
cold, or heat,

65
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,255
that could result
in hungry children.

66
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,162
Two generations
on either side of me

67
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,498
relishing the wonder of a seed,
the beauty in a bloom,

68
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,435
the gratification of growing.

69
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,804
Nana's gardens became
her vocation.

70
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,039
She buried regrets
and tended her plants

71
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:29,343
as she would have tended
patients.

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,945
My daughters garden
at their leisure,

73
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,881
free to pursue their callings:

74
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,517
teacher and writer,
professional athlete,

75
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,386
or nurse, if they so choose.

76
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,322
