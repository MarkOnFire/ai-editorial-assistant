00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:03,083
- We're at the Northern
Wisconsin State Fair,

3
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,375
checking out
the variety of entertainment,

4
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,333
exhibits, and animals,

5
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,917
highlighting
what's best about our state.

[whimsical circus music]

7
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,208
- So far, Yellow's got it.

8
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,999
- It all starts with
a look back at the rich history

9
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:16,999
of these fairgrounds

10
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,625
with Executive Director
Rusty Volk.

11
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,625
- Rusty Volk: How you doing?

12
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,709
This is the Northern
Wisconsin State Fair

13
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:25,999
and our 126th edition
of the fair.

14
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:26,999
When you go back and calculate,

15
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,750
this was the largest fair
in the state of Wisconsin

16
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,500
at the turn
of the century.

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,750
The Depression was a very
difficult time for everyone.

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,999
In 1932, there was no money
from any of the counties,

19
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,625
so businessmen in the region
got together

20
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,917
and purchased the Northern
Wisconsin State Fairgrounds

21
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:46,917
from the State of Wisconsin.

22
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,917
That's how we became
a privately-owned organization,

23
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,125
which we are still today.

24
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,875
- Okay, and the legacy remains,

25
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:58,083
so now we're, what,
almost 100 years removed.

26
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:58,834
- Correct, exactly.

27
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,542
- And things
are still going strong.
- Rusty: Exactly.

28
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,999
In 2007, the two owners
put it up for sale.

29
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,750
They were starting
to lose money,

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,999
so we saved
the fairgrounds.

31
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,999
That's where
this started.

32
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:12,750
The fair itself

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,999
has almost doubled
over the last three years,

34
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:20,083
where we're bringing in
120,000 people over fair week,

35
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,083
about $12 million worth
of economic impact

36
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,125
for the community.

37
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,959
As a nonprofit, all funds
go back into the facilities,

38
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,458
into the operation.
- Angela: It sounds exciting

39
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,542
and it's connected
to such a rich history

40
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:36,166
so it's great that
the fair and the fairgrounds
were able to be preserved.

41
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:36,875
- Exactly.

42
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:41,458
The tradition is very rich here
and it's very vast.

43
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,999
[all cheering]

44
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:44,875
- What might I expect today,

45
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,917
and are there certain things
that I should not miss?

46
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,250
- Well, what you can't miss
is the food.

47
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,792
- Okay.
- Number one,
you gotta make sure

48
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,834
you get the food 'cause
we have a wonderful variety.

49
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:54,999
And what
you can expect:

50
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,458
you're gonna see and witness
probably

51
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,999
the cleanest fairgrounds
that you're ever gonna be at.

52
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,583
Our carnival that we have,
North American Midway,

53
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:07,083
is the largest mobile carnival
operator in the United States.

54
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,083
- With my must-see list,
it was time for fun at the fair,

55
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:16,709
enjoying food, games, and a ride
to the top of the Ferris wheel,

56
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,792
all celebrating what's great
about Northern Wisconsin.
