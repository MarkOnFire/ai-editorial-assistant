00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,647
We join a group hitting
the trails on Onewheel,

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,784
a writer cruising the lake
for her next story,

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,556
a crocheter crafting
heartfelt messages for others,

8
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:27,127
and a group of teens taking
flight for the first time.

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,429

- Hello and welcome to
<i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,078
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

27
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,746
I'm gearing up
to hit the trails

28
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,116
with the Wisconsin
ATV - UTV Association,

29
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,452
an organization working
with local communities

30
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,890
to educate, support, and expand
this growing sport.

31
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,725
We've started our journey
in Lakewood,

32
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,161
exploring the trails
in Oconto County.

33
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,896
[twangy music]

34
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,668
Joining us for our ride is
the Hidden Bear Trail ATV Club,

35
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,907
a local chapter who maintains
and builds trails in the area...

36
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,276
all to support
this outdoor activity

37
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,412
that's grown exponentially
in recent years,

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,181
partly because
of the introduction

39
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,150
of Utility Task Vehicles
or UTVs.

40
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,389
A recent economic impact study
by the association

41
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,726
shows all terrain
and utility task vehicles

42
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,464
contributed $5.4 billion
to our state's economy.

43
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,901
The Wisconsin
ATV - UTV Association

44
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,037
has assisted in growing
local trail systems,

45
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,139
helping create routes
between towns

46
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,274
where people can stop,

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,009
grab refreshments,

48
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:22,943
or go shopping

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,412
before heading back out.

50
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,881
We'll also learn more
about how volunteers

51
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,018
are working to keep these trails
safe later in the show.

52
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,753
[shimmery music]

53
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,055
But first,
we join
another group

54
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,323
hitting
the trails

55
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,225
as we head
to Minocqua.

56
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,360
But they aren't
riding ATVs;

57
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,996
they're riding
Onewheels.

58
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,233
[mellow music]

59
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,776
- Zak Gruber:
Once you start kinda cruising

60
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,444
and feeling the wind
and everything else,

61
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,846
it's just
one of those things

62
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,381
where, like, your body
gets into it.

63
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,750
Might not be the way
to get into your zen,

64
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,820
but for a lot of people
who try it,

65
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,957
it seems like
it definitely is.

66
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,124
[laughs]

67
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,659
[board rattling]

68
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,394
[gritty music]

69
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,769
? Oh ?

70
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,139
? Oh ?

71
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,975
[crashing]

72
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,710
- Kyle Arn: Nice.

73
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,015
Kyle Arn:
I talked to my wife.

74
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,417
And I was just like, I gotta
get one of these things.

75
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,620
They're really expensive,
but I gotta get one.

76
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,389
And we made a deal that
if I quit smoking cigarettes,

77
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,824
she would get me
a Onewheel.

78
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,894
And four years later,
I'm still not smoking cigs,

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,263
so it worked.
[laughs]

80
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,064
- Brooks McMahon: It's kinda
different for everybody.

81
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,533
Some people, it's like,
instantly, they're natural,

82
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,834
and they'll just take off.

83
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,702
And some people, you need
to, like, help them balance.

84
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,504
For me, it was more like
that natural feeling.

85
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,039
[board clanking]

86
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:03,443
- Zak Gruber:
I've seen these things tumble
down sheer cliff sides

87
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,613
and, like, just roll
for hundreds of yards.

88
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,782
And the guy's freaking out,
like, "Oh, my baby!"

89
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,285
You know, he goes down there,
he's like, "It still works.

90
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,519
There's nothing
wrong with it."

91
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,987
[thud, clatter]

92
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,256
- Brooks McMahon: On the trail,
you're looking for rocks, roots.

93
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,891
You're looking for
different line choices,

94
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,259
what might be
the easiest path,

95
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,129
what might get you off
the ground and get you some air.

96
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,097
- Kyle Arn:
Like, in the fall here,

97
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,532
the trails,
they can get kinda gnarly.

98
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,967
And there's leaves
covering things up

99
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,203
and smash into a rock,
and you don't see it,

100
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,039
and all of a sudden,
you're on the ground.

101
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,842
- Zak Gruber: You're almost
mind-controlling it, you know?

102
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,944
It's like all--
it's all one part of your body.

103
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,545
And I think
once you get going,

104
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,347
all these things come together
at once.

105
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:45,652
And you kinda just are very
focused on what you're doing.

106
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,158
It's funny 'cause
I've asked a lot of people

107
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,459
this same question.

108
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,961
"How does a Onewheel work?"

109
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,430
Honestly,
I don't really know.

110
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,299
[rugged, high-octane music]

111
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,709
- Kyle Arn: You got the wheel,
which is the motor.

112
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,444
You have the battery.

113
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,712
And then, you have
the controller.

114
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,814
And then you have
the rails, right?

115
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,650
- Brooks McMahon: At 20 miles
an hour, 19 miles an hour,

116
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,820
so it gets you around town,
gets you out in the woods.

117
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,221
[clunking]

118
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,224
- Zak Gruber: Whatever this is,
you know, it is the future.

119
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,761
It's a different type
of board sport.

120
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,531
- Brooks McMahon:
It's very freeing.

121
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,132
Like, what we all
kinda relate it to,

122
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,467
it's called 'flow state.'

123
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,202
[soft marimbas]

124
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,841
[echoing vocalizations]

125
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,682
- Zak Gruber:
Flow state is something

126
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,084
that I think is different
for everybody.

127
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,819
? ?

128
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,991
- Kyle Arn: With the Onewheel,

129
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,927
there's just some sort
of connection that happens.

130
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,062
And you kind of just
let go.

131
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,897
Like, for me,
I like to put on music.

132
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:09,636
And just-- it's a good time to
reflect and just have to myself.

133
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,242
- Zak Gruber:
You can just do something

134
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,611
and completely zone out

135
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,713
everything else
that's going on around you.

136
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,648
You're just so focused
on what you're doing

137
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,283
at that point in time,
in that moment.

138
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,586
[soft, echoing music]

139
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,228
- Kyle Arn: I have met so many
good friends in Onewheeling,

140
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,762
just great people.

141
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,964
And it's like everybody--

142
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,632
you're just so passionate
about it, you know?

143
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,034
And everybody has that passion,
and you share that passion.

144
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,903
[heavy rock riffs]

145
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,476
- Brooks McMahon:
It's just that I've always
loved the board sport.

146
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,478
Like, I like the freedom
of being out and about.

147
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,847
For me, getting out
to trails like this

148
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,849
and finding
really beautiful spots--

149
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,018
it's cool just to
bring that community together.

150
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,753
And so it's just
a group of friends,

151
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,256
a group of people that
love to do the same thing.

152
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,992
[boards rattling,
wheels scraping]

153

[wheel whirrs]

154
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,831
- Zak Gruber: It's just
something fun for everybody.

155
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:16,203
It's a vast, wide thing that
someone who's into tech can ride

156
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,307
and someone who's into sending
crazy jumps or whatever

157
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,475
can ride, you know?

158
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,777
It's a-- it's a really cool
group of people

159
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:28,182
that are coming together
around this thing, you know?

160
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,683
It's so crazy.

161
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,418
[laughs]

162
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,921

[shimmery music]

164
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,694
- Angela: Up next,
we dock at Lake Hallie,

165
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,697
where a writer
cruises around
a beloved lake

166
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,333
in search
of her next story.

167
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,636
[upbeat acoustic]

168
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:54,608
- Wisconsin is home
to more than 15,000 lakes,

169
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,443
but one lake
in particular...

170
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,178
[bird cawing]

171
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,949
captivates author and writer,
Patti See.

172
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,385
- Patti See: The first time
I came to Lake Hallie,

173
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,422
I think, was probably
the summer of 1974.

174
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,792
- This lake has a story
for every season,

175
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,261
and Patti has
endless tales to tell.

176
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,263
- Patti: I write about
my quirky neighbors,

177
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,432
but, you know,
truth be told,

178
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,401
Patti See,
also quite quirky,

179
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,537
or I don't think
I would have embraced

180
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,239
living on
Lake Hallie

181
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,007
or living
in this house.

182
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,610
And so, it's a quirky house
on a quirky lake,

183
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,478
surrounded
by quirky people.

184
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,946
- Angela: Lake Hallie
is a place

185
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,083
local newspaper readers
often get to wade through.

186
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,485
- The thing I love most
about lake life

187
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,021
is that
I've just gotten to know

188
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,657
so many
different sorts of people.

189
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,692
And because
I write this monthly column

190
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,760
about Lake Hallie,

191
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,862
my friend Karen
is <i>convinced</i> that

192
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,864
that is why the lake
is getting busier.

193
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,401
- Karen has been Patti's
best friend since childhood.

194
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,503
- This is Karen.
- Karen Sabaska: Hi.

195
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,706
- She's the source, muse,
and co-defendant

196
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,575
for many
of Patti's stories.

197
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,579
- Well, I met Karen at Holy
Ghost Grade School, first grade.

198
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,416
We have been best friends
pretty much ever since then.

199
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:13,220
We are going on
almost 50 years of friendship.

200
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:18,392
- It's a friendship that has
seen plenty of boat rides.

201
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,894
- Patti See: Let's see
what we got for juice.

202
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,763
Ooh, a lot of juice.

203
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,799
- Out on the water,
these lifelong friends

204
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,870
have time to reminisce
with a can of beer, or two,

205
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,505
while cruising
Lake Hallie.

206
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,240
- Patti: Perfect.

207
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,009
Oh, that's good beer.

208
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,978
We've just seen each other

209
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,547
through so, so many things,

210
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,550
boyfriends and husbands
and children,

211
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,019
and she was always
there for me.

212
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,654
- Their memories are long.

213
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,657
However, the ride
will be short.

214
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,660
Well, to take a pontoon boat
ride around Lake Hallie,

215
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,162
you have to
go around twice,

216
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,899
so you feel like
you've been somewhere.

217
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,903
This lake life
is unique in that

218
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,738
it's a very
close-knit community.

219
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,273
It's a small lake.

220
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,776
You can see across,
you can yell across.

221
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,046
So, I talk to my neighbors,
literally from dock to dock.

222
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,781
[water gurgling]

223
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:19,853
My route is always that
I head towards the boat landing.

224
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,689
- Karen Sabasksa:
Osprey.       - Patti: Oh, yeah.

225
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,625
[high-pitched osprey screech]

226
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,760
- Karen: Maybe love
is in the air...

227
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,397
It's like,
"Oh, I think that's a boat."

228
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,934
- Whenever I pontoon,
this is the destination.

229
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,937
- Yeah, this is
- Patti: Yeah, we do.it.

230
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,841
We can see
the little children fishing.
[reel spinning]

231
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,110
The other huge landmark
is Lake Hallie Golf,

232
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,712
which has been here
since the 1920s,

233
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,917
and the lower nine
all are along Lake Hallie.

234
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,287
Just a lot going on
at that end of the lake.

235
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,023
- Angela: It's the end of
the lake where Karen's family

236
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,391
put down roots.

237
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,561
- Patti: This is
the Clark Hughes Boat Landing,

238
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,963
named after
Karen's grandpa.

239
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,133
She is the third generation
on Lake Hallie.

240
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,436
So, there was a time
that Karen probably could name

241
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,238
everybody who lived
on Lake Hallie,

242
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,240
but I don't know
that you could do it now.

243
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,075
- Karen: Oh, no,
not even a chance.

244
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,644
- Patti:                - Karen:
Kim and Ken.        Yeah, Steve.

245
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,181
- Sean from Leinenkugel's.
- Karen: Oh, I don't know him.

246
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,417
- Patti:
I don't know
his last name.

247
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,153
One of the things
that makes Lake Hallie special

248
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,821
is the history

249
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,990
and also
the people who love it.

250
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,459
- Angela: The other thing
that makes it special,

251
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,896
the boatload of stories
Patti fished out of this lake.

252
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,432
- Patti: I've always been
a person magnet,

253
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,467
particularly
strange person magnet,

254
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,669
which is how I got Karen.

255
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,038
- Patti's unique collection
of stories

256
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,709
will take you deep
into the weeds and reel you in.

257
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:52,279
- One of the reasons my stories
resonate with Wisconsinite

258
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,616
is so many people today
crave community.

259
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:59,019
They crave friendship;
they crave family.

260
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,689
And those are the top three
things that I write about.

261
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,994
You know, not just Karen,
though she's a topic

262
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,264
that I come back to
time and again,

263
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,399
can't tell you
the number of times

264
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,101
that people
have called out to me,

265
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,802
"I wanna be your Karen."

266
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,272
Like, "Oh, yeah?"
No, that's sweet.

267
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,341
- Those fans
who have read Patti's essays

268
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,945
fell in love with her
and Lake Hallie from afar.

269
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,380
- Patti:
"I have visited this lake

270
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,781
"since the summer
I turned seven.

271
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:31,118
"51st birthday,
I paddle Lake Hallie.

272
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,687
"The mirror-like water
and the fluidity of time

273
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,990
"conspire to make 30 or 40 years
on this lake

274
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,159
seem to pass
in a few ripples."

275
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,963
- Angela: Her book is called
"Here on Lake Hallie:

276
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,033
"In Praise of Barflies,
Fix-It Guys,

277
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,735
and Other Folks
in Our Hometown."

278
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:53,207
- In Chippewa Falls,
barfly is a really positive...

279
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,342
affectionate word,
term of endearment.

280
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,145
And the essays are really
in praise of barflies

281
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,313
and fix-it guys.

282
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,515
- It's a collection
of short stories

283
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:05,219
about a place
Patti long wanted to escape.

284
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,187
- I really did not expect
to live

285
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,823
in the Village of Lake Hallie
for the rest of my life.

286
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,027
And here I am,
just thriving and loving it.

287
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,762
[upbeat music]

288
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,502
- Living in a quirky house
with quirky neighbors,

289
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:22,870
Patti See

290
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:27,007
sees it all from her perch
above Lake Hallie.

291
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,042
- Patti: Every day
is something different

292
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,410
and fun
in a different way.

293
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,913
My neighbors,
my best friend, Karen,

294
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,884
we just have this bond
over Lake Hallie.

295
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,820
And so that makes it
a special place.

296
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,789
And I realize how blessed I am
to say that.

297

- I'm in Oconto County,

300
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,635
cruising along
the local ATV and UTV trails,

301
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,869
learning about
what it takes

302
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:58,272
to keep these trails
safe for everyone.

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,712
My first stop was
to meet up with Randy Harden,

306
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,750
president of Wisconsin
ATV / UTV Association,

307
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,253
to chat about their work
supporting this growing sport.

308
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,622
- Randy Harden: Wisconsin
ATV / UTV Association

309
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,660
is made up of
individual families, businesses,

310
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,461
clubs,
a lot of clubs,

311
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,264
about 120-plus local chapters
around the state,

312
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:28,135
and advocates that subscribe
to our, you know,

313
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,703
"Let's ride fun,
let's ride safe,

314
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,971
Let's do things
the right way."

315
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,706
And that's really
what we're all about.

316
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:33,974
- And it's important.

317
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,276
- It is.
It's a big sport.

318
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,112
There's close to half a million
machines now registered

319
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,048
both private and public.

320
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,685
Then we have
another 20... 25,000,
what we call non-residents,

321
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,654
where they come in and buy
a pass for five days or a year.

322
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,591
There's over 61,000 miles
of legal road routes

323
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,227
around Wisconsin that hook up
to our trail systems.

324
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,028
And that's what
makes up a network.

325
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,463
[vehicle engine roaring]

326
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,764
- That's impressive.

327
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,766
Can you tell us about
the significance of the work

328
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,934
the association does?

329
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,536
- Yeah, well, one
of our main jobs

330
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:03,904
is to help clubs,
our local clubs.

331
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,139
That's where everything happens
on the ground.

332
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,443
We provide tools, I guess tools
for their toolbox

333
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,512
and our
trail ambassador program.

334
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,681
We've got literally hundreds
of people that we've trained.

335
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,350
They go through
a certification.

336
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,418
Our ambassadors
are safety instructors

337
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,720
out on the trail,

338
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,522
but in a lighthearted way.

339
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,857
99% of the people are
just happy to say,

340
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,192
"Hey, I didn't know."

341
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,462
Or "Thanks for watching,"
so it's really a rewarding job.

342
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,864
- Wonderful, I'm glad to
hear that, it's, in general,

343
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,200
received pretty positively
by people.

344
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,903
- Randy: Our state organization
is functioning well,

345
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,505
but it wouldn't work
without our clubs.

346
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,940
- Angela: People like Jim,

347
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:44,111
president of a local club
here in Oconto County.

348
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,546
So, Jim,
tell us about your club.

349
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,247
- Jim Wisneski:
We have about 200,

350
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,782
I like to say,
"paying members,"

351
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,485
and probably if you count all
the spouses and the children,

352
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,453
there's probably
around 300, 400 people

353
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,821
in our local club here.

354
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,823
- Angela: What should we expect
today on our ride?

355
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,226
- The first part of the ride
is gonna be pretty smooth

356
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,828
'cause we're gonna be
on Nicolet State Trail.

357
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,698
We have a lot of trails
off of the Nicolet Trail

358
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,600
that we're gonna
be going on today.

359
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,236
A lot of nice scenery,
a lot of nice trees,

360
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,371
wildlife, deer, bear.

361
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,241
We'll see
just about anything today.

362
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,475
We don't know.

363
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,910
- Angela: You said
we're gonna see bears, maybe?

364
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,979
- Possibly,
I'm not gonna guarantee it,

365
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,581
but there is bear--
- Okay.

366
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,916
- Up in this area.
- Okay, that's good to know.

367
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,118
Thank you, Jim.
- Sure.

368
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,321
- Angela: It was time
to buckle our seat belts

369
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,989
and hit the trails.

370

371
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,892
[upbeat music]

372
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,496
No bear sightings this time,
but a safe trip,

373
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,099
all thanks to the efforts
of local clubs

374
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,970
and the Wisconsin
ATV / UTV Association.

375

[shimmery music]

377
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,977
For our next story,

378
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,479
we meet a crocheter
in Onalaska,

379
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,781
leaving heartfelt
notes of encouragement

380
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,084
to support mental health.

381
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,855
[gentle, hopeful piano]

382
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:07,127
Angela: In life,
messages are everywhere.

383
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:11,098
Most are broad, bold,
and to the point.

384
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,799
Some messages, however,

385
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,202
are buried, obstructed,

386
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,337
barely hanging on,

387
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:21,041
waiting for someone to come
along and reveal something

388
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,377
that's straight from the heart.

389
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,812
- Kathleen Jensen:
There's a lot of people
hurting in this world,

390
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,381
a lot of people
hurting.

391
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,018
And this is
such a simple, tangible way

392
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,121
to let people know
they matter,

393
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,056
to let them know
they're not alone.

394
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:39,493
And every saying means
something different to everyone.

395
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,262
The heart seems to find
exactly who needs them.

396
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,731
- Kathleen Jensen
knows all too well

397
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,901
what living with
the wrong message can do.

398
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,204
- Please know
that talking about suicide

399
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,506
does not
cause suicide.

400
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:56,009
Hopelessness
causes suicide.

401
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,114
I have struggled
with mental illness.

402
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,050
I have depression,
anxiety,

403
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,085
suicidality,
and PTSD.

404
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:08,722
And I'm so much better now
than I was...

405
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,324
even a year ago.

406
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,059
And I did live
eight years

407
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,528
wanting to kill myself
all day, every day.

408
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,296
It's rough.

409
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,633
- It's through her own
experience with mental health

410
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,202
that the Little Heart Project
was born.

411
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,304
Taking little
handmade crocheted hearts

412
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:28,208
with notes of encouragement
and the national suicide number

413
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,945
and placing them in public
for people to discover.

414
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,147
- Kathleen Jensen: And I think
that's probably also why

415
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,482
people are
so attracted to it

416
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,917
because
it's so simple.

417
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:38,085
It's quick.

418
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,454
It doesn't cost
much money.

419
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:44,191
And anyone can do it
anywhere, anywhere.

420
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:47,394
- In 17 months,
over 31,000 hearts

421
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,163
have left
Kathleen's home.

422
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,032
- It's a lot,

423
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:52,966
it's a lot.

424
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,034
Yeah.

425
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,069
- And with the help
of social media,

426
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,905
the Little Heart Project

427
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,773
has woven
a thread of kindness

428
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,143
that extends well beyond
just Wisconsin.

429
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,144
- They've been found

430
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,547
in Europe,
Delhi, India,

431
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,716
Central America,
Canada.

432
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,819
It's crazy.
[laughs]

433
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,556
It's just remarkable.

434
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:20,160
Just recently, a heart was
found at the Iowa State Fair.

435
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,462
And someone posted
a picture of that.

436
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,498
And I put it
on our social media.

437
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,868
And the next day,
I got a message from a woman

438
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:31,104
said, "My brother
recently died from suicide.

439
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,307
"A friend of the family
just found a heart

440
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,875
"at the Iowa State Fair.

441
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,844
"I live in Arizona.

442
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,579
How can I get involved?"

443
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,447
And so, she has
her own branch down there

444
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,983
where she's making the hearts,
tagging them,
and distributing them.

445
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,353
- Hundreds of others
have contacted Kathleen

446
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,356
and asked how they can
contribute to the project.

447
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:53,026
Like elementary school counselor
Matt Jacobson,

448
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,761
whose Make a Difference Club

449
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:59,333
traded hearts made of yarn
for plastic beads.

450
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,804
- Matt Jacobson: Last year,
we made over 300 hearts.

451
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,105
And the fifth graders

452
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,175
all tied them to every kid's
backpack in our school.

453
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,444
And in addition to that,
we made about another 50.

454
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,778
So, all elementary staff

455
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,081
have them on their backpacks
or their purse.

456
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,415
They become stories.

457
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,651
They're not just pieces
of plastic we hang on our bags.

458
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,886
They become people's stories.

459
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,455
So, yeah,
I get goosebumps as we talk.

460
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:24,191
- The project's reach has
even gotten the attention

461
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,527
of mental health professionals.

462
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,095
- Tim Blumentritt:
The Little Heart Project

463
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:31,798
is something
I've never encountered before.

464
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,035
Early in
my social work career,

465
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:37,104
never would
have imagined that

466
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,540
there would be a tool
like this.

467
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,542
More and more
in our profession,

468
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,444
we are appreciating

469
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,446
individuals
with a lived experience

470
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,982
to be a part of the whole
mental health movement.

471
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,018
And Kathleen's project

472
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,355
is probably one of the single
most impactful projects

473
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,760
that I've experienced in
my 33 years in helping people.

474
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,562
- I just want
to help people.

475
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,630
I want whoever finds that

476
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,832
to know
you're not alone.

477
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,902
You're not
the only one hurting.

478
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,673
And it's okay
to not be okay sometimes.

479
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,975
It's-- people aren't happy
all the time.

480
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,378
And I think sometimes
people think they should be.

481
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,247
And that's not realistic
at all.

482
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,850
And if you think
you should always be happy
and then you're not...

483
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:28,488
well, then your thoughts start
to spiral in a really bad way.

484
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:34,561
- There are good days,
and then, there are bad days.

485
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,330
From the outside,
you might say

486
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:40,267
Kathleen is trying
to string the two together.

487
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,602
- Talking about suicide

488
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,937
takes away
some of its power.

489
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:46,573
Truly, truly takes away
some of its power.

490
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,843
One heartfelt message
at a time.

491
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,846
- It's such an honor
to be a part of this

492
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,048
and to have people
have it resonating

493
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,918
with so many people
of all ages,

494
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,520
of all ages,

495
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,821
because
they're hurting people.

496
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,356
It's not
in your face.

497
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,157
It's not like
the suicide heart.

498
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:06,126
It's just
the Little Heart Project.

And if that's all it is,
that's enough...
that's enough.

For our

00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:20,040
we lift off
to Madison

504
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,209
to join a camp
propelling teens

- Susan Schwaab:
When you're up in the air
and you're flying,

509
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:38,192
you don't think
about anything else.

510
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,459
You're just flying.

511
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,029
It's what you're doing
and right where you are.

512
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,264
And that's
a beautiful feeling.

513
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,099
So, there's
a whole host of things

514
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,303
that make flying
pretty amazing.

- Fareed Guyot: So, you see
the emergency exits?

516
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,844
Camp Willa is a program of the
Willa Brown Aviation Academy.

517
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,681
It is a five-day day camp
during the summer

518
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,416
where we introduce kids,

519
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:06,286
mostly from underserved
and underrepresented
communities,

520
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,921
to aviation,

521
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:10,991
and all the possibilities,
from just being an enthusiast,

522
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:14,328
enjoying aviation, maybe being
a recreational pilot,

523
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,597
all the way up to
making it a career option.

524

[upbeat music]

525
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:22,870
- Right now,
female airline pilots are 6%

526
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,873
of the airline pilot crew.

527
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,075
Pilots of color are 3%.

528
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,577
And it's just
such an awesome job.

529
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:33,247
I never knew about it,
you know, as a girl.

530
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:36,483
I didn't grow up working on cars
and being around airplanes.

531
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,786
Until I met someone
that took me flying,

532
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,221
it never occurred to me.

533
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,589
So, that's what we want.

534
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:44,491
We want them
to just know it's out there.

535
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,226
When you get your flight,

536
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:49,863
you'll see the world from
a totally different perspective.

537
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,000
- We have somewhere
between 18 to 22 campers,

538
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,568
and this is our third year.

539
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,703
So we give 'em presentations
about aerodynamics

540
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,139
and even the lights
they see at the airport.

541
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,909
And then we take 'em on
a one-on-one airplane ride

542
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,211
toward the end of the week,
and they're just like,

543
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,146
"Man, this is awesome!

544
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,481
I never thought of this before."

545
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:09,249
And that's pretty much
the same comment.

546
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:11,084
- Student: I thought
I would never do this,

547
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,653
but as y'all can see,

548
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,489
I'm gonna fly
this little whatever,
plane, jet, whatever this is.

549
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,392
I'm gonna fly it today and we
gonna have a fun time, right?

550
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,660
- Fareed Guyot:
That's right.

551
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,662
When they
come back from that flight,

552
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:25,165
we want to see
that "post-flight grin,"
as I call it.

553
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,901
And a lot of people say
that they just love
that "aviator grin."

554
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,303
They're like,
"Oh, that was great."

555
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:32,973
- Whew, we did it.
[laughs]                  - Yay.

556
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,808
- Susan Schwaab:
I think they have the feeling

557
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,778
that if they can fly an
airplane, what else can they do?

558
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,281
You know,
that's the goal of the camp.

559
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:44,585
To just show them the
opportunities that are out there

560
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,220
to give them confidence

561
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:50,190
and also to talk to 'em
about what it takes,

562
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,659
the discipline
and the schooling.

563
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,863
So, all of that,
it's just a nice package.

564
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,331
And this is called
the pitot tube.

565
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:01,134
If you fall in love with this
and you love it, do it.

566
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,669
It's gonna be a lot of work.

567
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:03,637
It's gonna be hard.

568
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,472
It's gonna take
quite a long time.

569
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,974
Don't do it
for the money.

570
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,042
Don't do it for the glamour.
[chuckles]

571
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,778
But do it because
you have a passion for it.

about flying,

whether they wanna fly

flying and aviation

and how crucial it is
to our economy,

579
