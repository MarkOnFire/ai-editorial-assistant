00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,936
[gentle music]

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,708
- Angela Fitzgerald: Cindy
Bentley has never given up.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,244
As executive director
of People First,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,912
she has dedicated her career

5
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,581
to helping others
with disabilities.

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,351
- Cindy Bentley: You have to
have a purpose to be alive,

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,520
but you also have to have
a purpose

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,989
to helping other people.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,924
I like helping other people.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,026
- Angela: She serves
on several boards

11
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,828
and works with state agencies,

12
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,664
advocating
for equal opportunities.

13
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,267
It's a long way
from where she started.

14
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,337
- I was born with fetal
alcoholic syndrome/cocaine.

15
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,040
I was given 24 hours to live.

16
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,843
I was taken away from my mom
right at birth.

17
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,512
My mother was sent
to the Taycheedah prison

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,981
and I was sent
to the foster care center.

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,084
- Angela: Tragedy followed Cindy
at an early age.

20
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,388
At age eight, Cindy was sent
to an institution

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,723
for people with disabilities.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,325
- Cindy: And it wasn't
the greatest place.

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,295
And I was always having to fight
my way through.

24
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,097
A lot of times,
I thought about giving up.

25
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,832
I really did.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,871
And I didn't think I had a
purpose for a long time.

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,908
It was a coach there to help me.

28
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,111
I started running, but I would
complain a lot about it.

29
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,647
Then I started to like running.

30
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,684
And then I joined
the Special Olympics,

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,020
and that's what really
changed my life.

32
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,556
I just started to be happy.

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,461
- Angela: Cindy also discovered
she was good at winning.

34
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:39,499
Those wins led her to receive a
White House invitation twice.

35
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,903
- Cindy: President Clinton
in 2000.

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,372
President Bush.

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,043
And I gave him a gold medal
that I won in volleyball.

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,245
- Angela: That's right.

39
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,714
She gave her gold medal away.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,150
In fact, she's given many
of her medals away.

41
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,353
- Cindy: And how many medals
can you have?

42
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,421
I have a lot of medals.

43
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,690
- Angela: With a lifetime
of medals...

44
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:04,958
- Two.

45
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,195
- Angela: ...Cindy still finds
reasons to compete.

46
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,365
- Cindy: I started getting
a trainer last year

47
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,901
to get me more motivated.

48
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,769
She's a great trainer.

49
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,072
Nine and ten.
- Trainer: Nice job.

50
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,344
And I work on basketball
and I work on balance,

51
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,413
and then I do the bikes
and that.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,415
I just wanna be involved
with sports.

53
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,851
I'm a Brewer fan,
don't forget that.

54
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,186
- All right!
[hands slap]

55
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,421
- Angela: Sports keeps Cindy
involved in the community,

56
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,058
and community is the heart
of what Cindy does.

57
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,029
Whether on a personal level
or through her work.

58
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,864
- These are from last year
that I printed.

59
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,699
I printed extras
so you'd have them.

60
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,535
- Angela: She keeps an active
schedule at People First,

61
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,938
working closely with her
operations manager

62
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,073
and assistant, Nancy.

63
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,475
- A lot of what we do is
we try to really

64
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,145
keep an eye on what's going on
at the state level,

65
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,013
at the federal level
with different bills

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,915
that might impact people
with disabilities,

67
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,483
so she's pretty active.

68
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,552
Sometimes I feel
like I'm with a celebrity

69
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,588
when I'm out in the community
with her

70
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,257
because everyone's like,
"Oh, hi, Cindy, hi, Cindy.

71
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,226
And it's kinda wild.

72
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,261
- Let's clap it up for Cindy
real quick.

73
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,729
[applause and cheers]

74
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,600
- Angela: In May of 2024, Cindy
was celebrated by People First

75
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,335
and the State of Wisconsin.

76
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,738
- Hereby recognize the legacy.
- Oh, my God.

77
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,141
- Right, the legacy
of Cindy Bentley

78
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:32,045
and celebrates the positive
impact she has had

79
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:36,350
on countless individuals
in our greater community.

80
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,753
So thank you.
[applause and cheers]

81
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,491
- Angela: For Cindy,
it means so much more.

82
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,761
It's a marker of just how far
she has come.

83
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,564
- Cindy: I didn't even think
I'd make it this far to my age

84
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,065
because of what I was told.

85
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,469
You know, they said, "Oh, you're
not gonna amount to anything.

86
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,604
"You're gonna have to work
at a shelter workshop

87
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,107
and live at a group home
all your life."

88
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,508
Well, I don't do any of that.

89
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,243
I have a real job.

90
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,580
I have a real life.

91
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:11,618
- Angela: A life as an athlete,
an executive, a champion.

92
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,288
- Cindy: Trying to change
things, change laws,

93
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,091
change health care and make it
better, affordable housing,

94
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,526
all those things.

95
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,863
Until I can't do it anymore,
I'm gonna do sports

96
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,099
and I'm gonna do everything else
I wanna do with my life.

97
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,669
Done, there you go!
[laughs]

98
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,371
Bye, love you!
