1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:02,569
- Patrick Smith:
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,404
My name is Patrick Smith,

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,907
and I'm here to talk about
my gardening journey

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,642
over the last nine years,

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,812
from complete gardening novice
to someone

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,482
who dares to stand here
and call themselves a gardener.

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,251
You see, I believe the stories

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,652
that we tell
about our gardens,

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,489
our successes,
our failures, our challenges,

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,825
even our happy accidents,

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,895
are more powerful
when they're more personal.

12
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,130
So, thus,
"The Buckthorn Diaries,"

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,065
which is the story of me
and my garden,

14
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,936
which we jokingly call
Buckthorn Acres.

15
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,038
And this chapter,

16
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,774
which I'm calling
"The Improvisational Garden,"

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,543
it was my journey to discovering

18
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,280
sort of my gardening style,
if you will.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,416
And it's really,
when I say gardening style,

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,918
I'm calling it improvisational.

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,321
But what does that really mean,
improvisational?

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,759
Well, think of a trumpeter who
does a riff of a solo in jazz,

23
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,995
or maybe a cook
who goes to their refrigerator,

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,265
finds whatever is there,
and makes a delicious meal,

25
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:10,571
or maybe a speaker who is on
their way to their presentation

26
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,072
and loses their notes.

27
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,808
They give the presentation
and it turns out great,

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,945
even better than the last time
they did it.

29
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,181
These are all examples
of improvisation,

30
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,817
and I think we as gardeners

31
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:27,855
could use a healthy dose
of this kind of thinking.

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,124
It's like doing improv comedy,
which I do,

33
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:36,096
where you step on the stage not
knowing what is gonna happen.

34
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:40,634
And whatever happens, you say
"Yes," and then you add to it.

35
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,971
"Yes, and" is the first rule
of improvisation.

36
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,939
And in a similar way,

37
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,409
you take what
Mother Nature gives you

38
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,245
and you say, "Yes, and."

39
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,981
You say, "Yes, I have clay soil,

40
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,818
and I'm going to plant plants
that thrive in clay soil."

41
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,487
Or, "Yes, I have dry shade,

42
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,658
and I'm gonna find plants
that love those conditions."

43
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,194
It's kind of what happens

44
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:12,499
after you try to control
all the elements of your garden

45
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,369
and realize that it's futile.

46
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,706
And you realize,
no matter how hard you work,

47
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,010
that perfection
is a little boring

48
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,213
and that really staying
in the present moment,

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,982
accepting reality,
saying, "Yes, and,"

50
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,717
is gardening.

51
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,254
Hell, it's, heck, it's living.

52
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,624
Ultimately, it should
all come together in a way

53
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,727
that reflects the time,
the place, the environment,

54
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,930
of course, the plants.

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,334
But more importantly to me,
it includes you

56
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,006
and should be the ultimate
reflection of you.

57
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:57,845
Your strengths, your successes,
your point of view.

58
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:02,049
That, to me,
is the most beautiful garden.

59
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,720
And it's a garden that
no one else can create but you.

60
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:12,392
Now, I begin my improvisational
gardening journey

61
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,829
with very, very humble
beginnings,

62
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,966
with what I call
"what's left in the fridge."

63
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,236
We bought our house
in September of 2015.

64
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,372
We had lived in the city
for decades.

65
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,140
We wanted more space,

66
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,277
we wanted more nature,
and we wanted more dogs.

67
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,812
We were dog people.

68
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,847
And all of that
seemed possible here.

69
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,650
And we just thought,
"Grass, good.

70
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,554
Trees, good,
woods in the back, good."

71
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,422
We thought
we'd plant a vegetable garden,

72
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,858
maybe grow some plants.

73
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:49,062
Other than that,
though, we knew nothing.

74
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,166
The first thing that came
to mind was "mullet house."

75
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,570
We had a big, beige, bland,
boring house in the front

76
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,438
and a bunch of wild in the back,

77
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,942
so business in the front,
party in the back.

78
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,279
And really, for nine years,
I've gone with that theme

79
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,115
rather than a particular style.

80
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,517
Ideas have come and gone,

81
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:16,523
but the very first morning
we woke up in the new house,

82
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,892
got our coffee,
and went to the windows

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,729
to look out at the back
of the property, we saw this.

84
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,233
A 40-foot spruce had
just fallen over on the patio

85
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,836
in the middle of the night,
as if it had just given up

86
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,437
in the middle of the night.
[audience laughing]

87
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:34,975
What should have been a warning,
we took as a wake-up call.

88
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,944
It was time to get to work.

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,681
In hindsight,
we were <i>comically</i> naive.

90
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,617
So cue the tiny violin.

91
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,221
Once we saw that,
we started to see

92
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,525
what we had really purchased:
a whole lot of nothin'.

93
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:56,930
And what was there was old and
tired and worse for the wear.

94
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,333
In fact, if you look
in the upper left-hand corner

95
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,901
of that photo,

96
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,904
those flowers are
plastic lotuses...

97
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,639
[audience laughing]

98
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,742
...floating
in the water feature.

99
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,544
[audience laughing]

100
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:14,948
Ah, the truth is,
I didn't follow that warning.

101
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,886
I immediately started
planting what I thought I knew.

102
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,654
I planted perennials all fall

103
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,957
and into the next year
with no plan.

104
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,694
And it wasn't
until I was in the middle

105
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,364
of reading the latest
coffee table gardening book

106
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,100
that I thought would
really help me

107
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,504
that I realized I was in way,
way over my head.

108
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,206
Luckily, in that same book,

109
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,542
I came across the name
of Roy Diblik

110
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,343
of Northwind Perennial Farm.

111
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,914
Some of you may know him
or know of him.

112
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,516
Thank God I came across
that name.

113
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,318
And, in fact,
I just picked up the phone

114
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,153
and immediately called.

115
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,855
It took a few phone calls,

116
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,823
but Roy Diblik showed up
at my front door

117
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,027
and we took a tour
of our property.

118
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,931
And Roy, as kind and humble
as he is,

119
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,267
looked at me at the end
of the tour and said,

120
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,735
"Patrick, you do know

121
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,439
you bought five acres
of invasive plants, right?"

122
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,842
[chuckling]
I almost burst into tears.

123
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,044
[laughing]
And we had.

124
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,279
Well, it wasn't
quite five acres.

125
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,481
We bought four acres
of invasive plants,

126
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,152
five acres of diseased
and dying trees,

127
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,223
and a whole lot
of turf grass and bark mulch.

128
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:35,262
That began my real journey
towards becoming a gardener.

129
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,797
From that moment--
Oh, sorry.

130
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,634
From that moment,
I knew we had to remove

131
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,804
those groves of buckthorn
and invasive honeysuckle,

132
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:46,840
along with all those diseased
and dying trees.

133
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,977
Out came ash and pine
and spruce,

134
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,879
two beautiful specimen trees

135
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,381
that were splitting
down the middle,

136
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,350
and this arborvitae

137
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:01,255
that looked like it was
slowly eating the house alive.

138
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:06,260
And inside that arborvitae was
the back door to the house

139
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:10,264
that they had just continued
to carve out a hole for.

140
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,431
Yeah.

141
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, all that, you know,
sounds easy,

142
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,803
but it was difficult,
expensive,

143
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,407
and a little traumatic
because many of the trees

144
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,209
were part of the reason
we bought the property

145
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,911
in the first place.

146
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:28,482
And with the trees went
a lot of my excitement.

147
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:33,153
Long term, I was emboldened,
but that took years.

148
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,156
And after that first wave
of tackling

149
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,459
all the invasive trees
and woody invasives,

150
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,062
I mean, the dying trees
and woody invasives,

151
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,230
guess what?

152
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,066
We set the table
for the onslaught

153
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,001
of herbaceous invasives.

154
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,670
You name it, we got it.

155
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,939
Purple nightshade,
garlic mustard,

156
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,341
creeping Charlie.
I could go on.

157
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:58,879
Name a weed or an invasive,
we probably had it.

158
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,647
And I learned
that there wasn't really

159
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,382
gonna be an end to that,

160
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,218
that there would be
subsequent waves

161
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,254
of plant deaths and invasives,

162
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,658
and that I was going to have to
spend time and money and effort

163
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:16,496
to continue to basically
keep them pushed back,

164
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,898
because I think
many of you know,

165
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,701
we never really get rid
of those things.

166
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,937
We're always, again, kind of
trying to find that balance

167
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:29,309
between what we can live with
and how aggressive they can be.

168
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:34,314
Now, during that whole period
of erasing the chalkboard,

169
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,784
I began to really take stock, to
ask myself the harder questions,

170
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,255
like, "You do know you don't
know what you're doing?"

171
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,590
And, "Why am I doing this?

172
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,259
"What do I need to learn?

173
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,194
Who can I get help from?

174
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,529
What inspiration do I have?"

175
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:53,300
And that is really the point
at which I realized

176
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,537
that inspiration is everywhere,

177
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,139
and that the whole rest
of my life

178
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,775
could inform what I was doing
in the garden.

179
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,444
And I had not made
that connection.

180
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,147
And I knew that I could find
mentors and get educated,

181
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,815
'cause up to that point,

182
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,951
I had been doing
internet searches,

183
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,021
which we know everything's
true on the internet,

184
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,757
and buying fancy
coffee table books.

185
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,493
And I just was more confused.

186
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,998
So I started looking
and looking back in the past,

187
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,467
looking at photos
I had taken over the years.

188
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,337
And I suddenly realized, I am,

189
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,074
I'm starting
my improvisational journey.

190
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,475
And that was the birth

191
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,411
of my improvisational
gardening approach.

192
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,346
I started looking at places
that I'd been.

193
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,916
I've been very fortunate
to spend a career

194
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,985
traveling around the world.

195
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,088
And I started going through
old photos and realized

196
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:52,526
I had taken as many pictures
of art and gardens

197
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:56,363
and other things than the actual
work I was supposed to be doing.

198
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,798
[laughing]

199
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,000
And all of a sudden, I'm like,
"Wait, wait a minute.

200
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,169
"I'm surprised I've taken
these pictures

201
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,538
of gardens that, you know..."

202
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,106
I had never connected
to the fact

203
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:09,409
that now suddenly
I want to be a gardener.

204
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,613
And every place has been
a source of inspiration.

205
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,281
And I've also lived
across the country.

206
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,584
And so from Seattle, Washington,
to New York City,

207
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,588
from Kansas City to Nashville,
from Atlanta to Milwaukee,

208
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:25,626
I really started to see that
there was a lot of inspiration

209
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,196
and a lot of things that
could inform what I was doing.

210
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,131
And even to this day,

211
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,534
a lot of the plants
I've chosen are subtle,

212
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,269
well, and not-so-subtle
reminders

213
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,104
of the places I've been.

214
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,107
And I remembered a quote that
I loved from Diana Vreeland,

215
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,142
who was a former editor
of <i>Vogue</i> magazine,

216
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,746
and she said,
"The eye has to travel."

217
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:50,017
And when you think about that,
our eye is our dominant sense.

218
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,553
It's not just the way
we see the world,

219
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,588
it's the way
we perceive the world.

220
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,823
It's the way
we navigate the world.

221
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,627
We are predisposed
to connect the dots.

222
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,331
Now, my work background is
a whole other story.

223
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,868
I spent 32 years
in fashion merchandising,

224
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,204
in product development
and design.

225
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,107
And I, you know, when I retired,
I thought that was the past,

226
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,442
and I was looking forward

227
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,911
to discovering what
my interests were.

228
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,514
I didn't think it had a
connection to gardening at all.

229
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,416
But just one simple example.

230
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,619
You know, in my
fashion merchandising career,

231
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:30,023
you know, we developed an item
that became an outfit

232
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,393
that became a wardrobe
that had seasons,

233
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,363
that balanced style
versus trend.

234
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,531
Hmm.

235
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:41,068
You buy a plant,
you group it with other plants,

236
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,303
becomes a bed, becomes a garden,

237
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,340
is part of a landscape
that has seasonality

238
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,942
that you balance style
versus trends.

239
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:54,081
Wow, maybe I can take the tools
that I thought I couldn't use

240
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,384
and just use them
in a different way in my garden.

241
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,420
I started to show up
in my garden.

242
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,825
And I'm just gonna show you
a few photos.

243
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,495
First, I just made
visual connections.

244
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,899
A photo I had taken of a men's
shirt display in New York,

245
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,235
suddenly I visually connected it
to a display of tulips

246
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,938
I saw in downtown Chicago.

247
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:21,475
Then I started making real
connections to the plants.

248
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:25,445
This women's jacket,
when I saw these Crispa tulips,

249
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,081
I remembered the trim
on that jacket.

250
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,251
I was starting
to connect the dots.

251
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:35,589
This custom motorcycle paint
that I saw at a rally

252
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:39,993
inspired me to use those colors
in this planter.

253
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,363
And this piece of folk art
I saw in Puerto Vallarta

254
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,334
showed up in the color story
we used in our front yard.

255
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:51,071
And lastly,
and kind of sentimentally,

256
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,908
I came across this picture
I'd taken of a custom dress,

257
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:59,346
and the skirt reminded me of
my grandmother's prized tulips

258
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:01,982
that she was obsessed with,

259
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,852
which inspired me
to plant the only tulips--

260
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,288
I mean, the only roses
I have in my garden.

261
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,191
And to me, that was kind of
a full-circle moment

262
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,926
when I realized that,

263
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:17,731
you know, the whole art inspires
us, which inspires the art.

264
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,933
Now it's in the garden.

265
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,371
And finally,
from an education perspective,

266
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:29,943
thank God I finally found
the Master Gardener Program.

267
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,914
UWM Master Gardener Program
was so critical for me

268
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:38,385
because it's based in science
and evidence-based information.

269
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:42,456
And after all that
searching and YouTubing

270
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,259
and buying all these books
and being very confused,

271
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,761
I found I could really have
a framework

272
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,465
to judge what worked
and didn't work,

273
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:55,536
or that I could really learn,
try and learn and apply.

274
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,803
That was really
the critical thing.

275
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,972
But I also loved
the volunteer part.

276
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,175
And I have to say,
I don't know that I would

277
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,676
even be standing up here today

278
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:06,446
if it wasn't for the people
that I volunteer with

279
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,017
at Lynden Sculpture Garden
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

280
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,755
They're a big part of the reason
I'm even here today.

281
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,624
But then I thought,
my earliest memories

282
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,960
of gardens and gardening,
which I felt almost

283
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,462
detached from,
my grandparents.

284
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,131
Talk about differences.

285
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,801
Grandma and Grandpa Smith were,
it was like a Rockwell painting.

286
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,038
The white clapboard house,
the big vegetable garden,

287
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,940
Grandma's prized cherry tree
in the front yard

288
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,876
that we just completely
decimated,

289
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,046
and all of her bachelor buttons
around the root cellar.

290
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,149
Contrasted with Grandma
and Grandpa Schnoebelen,

291
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,284
my German grandparents
who lived in the city,

292
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,920
and everything was perfect
and orderly,

293
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,289
and we were free labor
for that garden.

294
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,024
[all laughing]

295
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,795
But it was beautiful
and aspirational.

296
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,797
And then finally,
I thought of my dad,

297
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,866
who, even though
he'd grown up on a farm,

298
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,701
came late to gardening.

299
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,603
And I think
when I look back on it,

300
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:06,573
that that was probably
because after raising nine kids,

301
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,043
it was probably the one place
where he felt not only at ease,

302
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,113
but a little bit more
in control.

303
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,719
Now, of course, I was inspired
by other gardeners,

304
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,387
and since I loved perennials,

305
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,589
I'm not even sure
why I was so drawn to them,

306
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,760
I was drawn to the people
I call The New Perennialists.

307
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,962
So on the left here,
you see Piet Oudolf,

308
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,665
who is arguably one of the
most famous garden designers

309
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:32,933
in the world right now.

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,935
He did the Lurie Garden
in Chicago,

311
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,371
the High Line in New York.

312
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,107
And I loved the depth
and complexity

313
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:43,110
of his naturalistic plantings,
and that he said

314
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:46,513
a garden is beautiful
in every season,

315
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,583
and that brown,
just like whatever other color

316
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,819
is your favorite color,
is a color, too, in the garden

317
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,355
that can be used to effect.

318
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,358
The center photo
is a garden that was designed

319
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,027
by a firm called
Oehme van Sweden,

320
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,597
and they pioneered the use
of ornamental grasses.

321
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,499
Well, for a kid from Kansas

322
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:09,203
to look at designed garden
like this

323
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,041
that not only didn't rely on
a tremendous amount of flowers,

324
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:18,011
but flowed right into the land
and to the farmland beyond,

325
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,247
it reminded me
of growing up as a kid

326
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:24,618
and driving through the
tallgrass prairie in Kansas.

327
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:29,289
I was really now, you know,
getting going with this idea

328
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,592
that you could find
inspiration everywhere.

329
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,826
And finally,

330
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,329
on the far right,
you see Roy Diblik,

331
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,298
who I call my Yoda of gardening.

332
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,402
He is just literally the most
humble man you'll ever meet,

333
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,839
and you'll learn more from him
in a casual conversation

334
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,809
than any number
of gardening videos.

335
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:52,145
His idea of plant communities,
I'm just beginning

336
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,249
to understand in my own garden,
and the fact that you can

337
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,485
start simply
with three to five plants

338
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:02,456
and learn how plants really grow
and how they live together,

339
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,526
and just keep building
on those three to five plants.

340
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:09,596
And finally,
he calls sedges "living mulch."

341
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,865
And I am now
officially obsessed,

342
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,500
and I hope nobody ever finds out

343
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,703
how many I have put
in my property.

344
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,440
Inevitably, this led me

345
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,977
to the newest sources
of inspiration for me:

346
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,979
a group of gardeners
I call The New Naturalists.

347
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,648
And these are
just three examples.

348
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,982
There are tons more.

349
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,953
I encourage you to go and
find out more about these folks.

350
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,888
I picked these three

351
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:38,625
because they really represent
really such a dynamic

352
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,694
and diverse approach

353
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,164
to what gardening is
all about right now.

354
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,634
And call it
ecological horticulture

355
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,136
for the fancy term,

356
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,772
call it naturalistic,
call it sustainable,

357
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,173
but that's what they're doing.

358
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,742
That's what they're pioneering.

359
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:59,146
Doug Tallamy,
I call him The Professor.

360
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,248
He is a professor of etymology,

361
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:06,119
and he helped create
HomegrownNationalPark.org,

362
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,891
which has a lofty goal
of encouraging all of us

363
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,393
to plant more natives
in our yards,

364
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,697
up to half
of your property in natives.

365
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,766
And if we did that,
not only would it be

366
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,803
the biggest national park
in the United States,

367
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,840
it would actually be the size of
about 10 of them put together.

368
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:29,843
And all they're asking us to do
is invite nature into our,

369
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,113
back into our properties,
where it used to belong.

370
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,349
He also pioneered the idea,
and I love this,

371
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,417
of keystone plants,

372
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,621
plants that punch
above their weight,

373
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,123
plants that interact
with more living things

374
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,791
than most of us could imagine.

375
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,628
And for him, the oak tree
is the perfect example.

376
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,196
One oak tree in your yard

377
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,966
interacts with over 500
different microorganisms:

378
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:56,036
caterpillars, birds, mammals.

379
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:01,308
That's a heck of a lot more
than that green ball

380
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,877
of a burning bush
in the front yard that,

381
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:06,613
for a couple of weeks
in the fall,

382
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,282
kind of turns red
'cause it's ashamed

383
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,184
that's all it can do.

384
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,252
[audience laughing]

385
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,055
Now, I don't mean
to be so mean to--

386
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:18,659
If you have a burning bush,
by all means, keep it.

387
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,494
But maybe add to it

388
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,963
and add something
that really does interact,

389
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,699
you know, that promotes life.

390
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,635
Kelly Norris, this is
his garden in the center

391
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,137
in Des Moines, Iowa.

392
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:33,540
He used to be the director of
the Des Moines Botanical Garden.

393
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:38,078
He is now a private designer for
both public and private gardens.

394
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,714
And I call him The Artist,
because when I look at that,

395
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,483
it looks like
an impressionist painting.

396
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:48,956
And it's deceptively simple, but
really complex in its planting.

397
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,426
And I just think that's amazing
that that's all native plants.

398
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:56,063
And finally, Benjamin Vogt,
I call him The Activist because,

399
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,166
like me, he came to gardening
pretty late.

400
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,834
He was a journalist
and a writer.

401
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:05,138
He lives in a suburb of,
in Nebraska in a subdivision.

402
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,674
And when he discovered
native plants

403
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,744
and sustainability,
he went deep.

404
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:15,649
He doesn't look at just the
history of the lawn in America,

405
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,553
but the sociological impact
and all the other elements

406
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,355
that got us to the place
we are today,

407
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,323
where our lawn is a thing

408
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,193
that takes up so much
of our time and resources,

409
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,830
but doesn't really interact
with much.

410
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:34,768
His quote is, "Prairie up"
and "Un-lawn America."

411
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,538
And, you know,
between the three of them,

412
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:42,009
I really began to learn
and accept the reality

413
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:46,180
that we are living in the era
of environmental gardening.

414
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,848
Many of you may know that,
maybe.

415
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:52,386
I'm sure many of you are farther
along that journey than I am.

416
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,822
And just, you know,
let's just acknowledge

417
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,824
we have a biodiversity crisis.

418
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:59,660
We have a climate crisis.

419
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,495
And not to get into science
or anything,

420
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,130
just, if you're a gardener,

421
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:05,465
surely you know
things have changed.

422
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:09,036
At least I know in nine years,
I've already had a zone change,

423
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,572
and I think there have been
three in my lifetime.

424
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,274
I know my winters
are a little drier.

425
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,543
I know the rest of the year
is unpredictable,

426
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,745
and it's almost always
on the edge of a drought,

427
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,514
if not in one.

428
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,683
That's certainly not the way
it used to be.

429
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:26,486
But I love the way
gardeners in particular

430
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,755
are rising to the challenge.

431
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,291
They're trying new things,
they're talking to each other.

432
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,993
Things that used to be
kind of separate,

433
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,563
horticulture, ecology,
are starting to merge.

434
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,432
And I think we're all starting
to realize

435
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,534
that a lot of what we've learned

436
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:43,537
and a lot of what we do
in our gardens

437
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:49,076
is kind of counterintuitive
to how nature actually works.

438
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:52,179
And that's where I sort of began
to make my connection

439
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,347
to sustainability.

440
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,948
I mean,
I've come late to the party

441
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:58,785
and I've got a lot to learn,
but it really resonated with me,

442
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:02,055
this idea that you show up,
you accept reality,

443
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,958
and you add to it
based on what you've learned.

444
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,294
You observe nature,
you partner with nature,

445
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,763
just like I go on the stage
and partner with the person

446
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,301
across from me,
and create reality together.

447
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:16,603
I looked up the definition
of sustainability,

448
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,573
and you can read it here,
what it entails.

449
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,076
And I thought,
the words may be different,

450
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:26,680
but when I think about
what improvisation means to me,

451
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,249
sustainability,
improvisation both are about

452
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,318
accepting reality,
being in the present,

453
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:34,288
working with and not against,

454
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,691
less control
and more partnership,

455
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,662
and accepting the unexpected.

456
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,967
Now, I also realized that

457
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:50,370
sustainability really entails
all the things

458
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,806
we already are familiar with
as gardeners.

459
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,374
You can read this list.

460
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,076
You know,
we all know soil health,

461
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,477
water efficiency,
plant selection.

462
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,012
I won't read the whole list.

463
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,048
I'll just give you
one example to me

464
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,717
where I think sustainability
is just looking at our gardens

465
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,285
through a different lens,

466
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:09,156
and that resonated with me:
soil health.

467
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,693
I learned very early on
as a master gardener

468
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,428
to get a soil test.

469
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,330
And I think everyone should.

470
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,664
They're really helpful.

471
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:21,101
But what I noticed is that
when you get your soil test,

472
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:23,904
it tells you, you know, what
your soil composition is,

473
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:27,207
but it also has
all sorts of recommendations.

474
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,976
You know,
it might be low in nitrogen,

475
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,143
or you might need phosphorus.

476
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,114
It's very alkaline
or it's very acidic,

477
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:38,785
implying that we should all do
something to make it better.

478
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,454
Through the lens
of sustainability,

479
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,523
I look at it now and go,

480
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,325
"Do I really need to <i>do</i>
anything?"

481
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:49,062
I mean, this is just what
my soil is, right?

482
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:52,566
And when I think about
Mother Nature,

483
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,101
doesn't she have a solution

484
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:57,871
for just about every situation
and condition?

485
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:02,409
So maybe before I put
that shovel in the ground--

486
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:06,446
which, by the way,
gardening is disturbance.

487
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:10,450
Before I disturb,
maybe I should think twice

488
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,754
and not think that I have
to change everything so much.

489
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,257
And I could
kind of get behind that.

490
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,526
I kind of simplify
sustainability

491
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,229
into just nature-driven
decision-making.

492
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,031
And I can get behind that.

493
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,199
Plant more plants?

494
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,366
I'm in.

495
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,801
You know,
I'm literally at probably

496
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:31,638
about the 27th stage
of gardening addiction.

497
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,006
So plant more plants?

498
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:34,174
Good for me.

499
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,342
Plant 'em closer together?

500
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,710
I'm in.

501
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,745
Plants are social,
and they live in community.

502
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:42,482
They literally lean on each
other and support each other.

503
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:47,821
And my favorite, no plant ever
evolved to grow in bark mulch.

504
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,325
It doesn't rain down
from the sky.

505
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,994
There isn't a special season
where it shows up.

506
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:58,832
Plants actually
go through last year's debris.

507
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,534
And I could get behind that
because, again,

508
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:03,470
like I said,
gardening is disturbance.

509
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,138
And guess what?

510
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,174
Mother Nature's response
to disturbance

511
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,109
is what we call weeds.

512
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,613
They're early colonizers,
they're first responders.

513
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,048
And so we have to learn
that if we're gonna disturb,

514
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,518
let's make it
a beautiful disturbance.

515
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:22,289
And let's use some of her tools,
like native annuals,

516
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,025
to get a jump on the "weeds"

517
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:28,228
that we don't want
in our gardens.

518
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:31,632
Essentially, to me,
sustainability is just

519
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,034
conscious stewardship.

520
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,905
And stewardship,
but not ownership.

521
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:41,041
And dynamic, alive,
not static.

522
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:45,646
Integrated, not isolated
like that burning bush.

523
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,948
Responsible beauty,
not just pretty.

524
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,449
Like, what is it contributing?

525
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:52,719
You're beautiful, but what else
can you do for me?

526
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:54,288
And collaboration, finally,

527
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,156
which is the key
to improvisation.

528
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,759
Collaboration, not control.

529
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:02,963
So after all that, it was time
for me to really get to work,

530
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,498
to kind of almost begin again,

531
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:07,000
although I never stopped working
in the garden this whole time,

532
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,170
but to really get clear
about my priorities

533
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,872
and what I wanted to accomplish.

534
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:14,374
It became easy after that.

535
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:17,411
My goals are simple
and straightforward.

536
00:26:17,477 --> 00:26:20,914
I want responsible beauty,
not just pretty.

537
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:22,983
I don't want to just plant
more native plants,

538
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,985
which is where I'm at right now.

539
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:28,455
I don't pretend to be far along
in this sustainable journey,

540
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:31,091
but I really feel good
about getting on board

541
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:33,927
and celebrating native plants.

542
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:38,131
And I've learned the hard way
from so many failures

543
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:40,701
that the more botanically
diverse my garden is,

544
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,837
the more it can withstand
whatever comes my way.

545
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:47,674
Because I've planted those
dozens of ninebark cultivars

546
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:51,745
and watched
powdery mildew destroy them.

547
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:54,948
I've planted a hedge
of viburnums

548
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:59,653
and watched viburnum leaf beetle
eat them alive.

549
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,357
So now, as my garden becomes
more diverse,

550
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,926
even if something bad
does happen,

551
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,995
it's not as dramatic.

552
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:13,700
Everything else can lift
the weight while that recovers,

553
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:19,339
and I can go about the business
of doing more fun things.

554
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,909
I want to be curious,
I'm naturally curious.

555
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:26,880
I love taking chances and being
responsible for my mistakes,

556
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:29,216
but I actually want
to cultivate curiosity.

557
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:32,119
I decided to devote
several beds in my garden

558
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:35,055
to just finding out
what happens.

559
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:38,792
I call one
the Island of Misfit Toys.

560
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,762
And the other one is
literally the nursery,

561
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,797
just to see
how these things grow

562
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:48,202
before I spend a ton of time
and effort and money on them.

563
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:51,004
And finally, I want to leave the
land healthier than I found it,

564
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,840
which, by the way,
is my easiest goal,

565
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:54,341
because as I told you,

566
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:57,377
when you start with five acres
of invasive plants,

567
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,513
you have nowhere to go but up.

568
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,215
[audience laughing]

569
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,785
My gardening style maybe
will always be a hodgepodge.

570
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:08,055
I've used words like
naturalistic and aspirational

571
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,390
and experimental,
but at the end of the day,

572
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:13,260
I landed on improvisational.

573
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:16,630
Accepting what you have,
adding to it,

574
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:21,034
learning and experimenting
based on knowledge.

575
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:24,438
Really, it's 10 pounds of flour
in a 5-pound bag.

576
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,573
But improvisational is
where I kind of landed

577
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,209
and where I feel
most comfortable.

578
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:31,712
My plant,
I love planting themes.

579
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:33,914
These are my planting themes:

580
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:36,016
joy and abundance,
plant communities,

581
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,351
transition to natives,

582
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,753
and you see this connection
to all the things

583
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,223
that I really spent time
sitting with

584
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,360
and figuring out
what kind of resonated with me.

585
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:49,696
Joy and abundance, to me,
say what you will,

586
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:52,566
I look at that
and everything is alive.

587
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,836
The climbers are climbing,
the bloomers are blooming,

588
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,006
the trees are treeing
and the shrubs are shrubbing.

589
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,508
Here is more abundance,
but here it's really,

590
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:04,945
this is a community of plants
that probably has done better

591
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:07,214
than any number of beds
in my garden.

592
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,249
They're really happy together,

593
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:12,286
and they're,
it's about half natives.

594
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:15,055
I'm trying to get to about 70%.

595
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:16,523
Some are from Roy Diblik's

596
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,792
appropriate perennial plant
list,

597
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:23,297
and a few are just because
they mean something to me.

598
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,499
I call this the Granny Garden
because a lot of them

599
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:27,367
are more old-fashioned,

600
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,137
and also because there are
some favorite plants.

601
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:31,905
There are peonies in there
that remind me

602
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:33,540
of one of my grandmothers.

603
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:37,644
There are a few daylilies
that remind me of my mom.

604
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,881
This cultivar,
this photo, pardon me,

605
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:45,185
is of cultivars that are
turning into more native plants.

606
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:47,621
Obviously, the spruce tree is
not a native,

607
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,023
but it has a home 'til it dies.

608
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,292
And we're already starting
to plant other trees

609
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,163
that are native to take up
the mantle when it's gone.

610
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,599
The ironwood tree
in the foreground is native,

611
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:02,169
and those ninebarks you see
are gone

612
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,571
and have been replaced
with more native plants.

613
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,807
And finally, happy accidents.

614
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,943
These orange daylilies
were not my friends.

615
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,445
I thought I got rid of them.

616
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:13,981
I planted a hedge of hydrangea.

617
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:17,050
And, no, they come up
every year stronger than ever,

618
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:20,487
and for about three weeks
in August, they're beautiful.

619
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:24,725
I call it the creamsicle border,
and I had nothing to do with it,

620
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:28,095
but I take full credit.
[audience laughing]

621
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,164
On the right, nothing but green.

622
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:33,500
But every time
I look out the window,

623
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,469
it's just so calming to me,

624
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:37,070
even though
from a design perspective,

625
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:40,007
it really doesn't make
any sense.

626
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:42,809
My planting priorities are
straightforward, too.

627
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:45,946
Now, I plant nothing
but native trees and shrubs,

628
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,315
not just for structure,
it's legacy,

629
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,350
because I know
that there's no way

630
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:54,655
I can handle an entire landscape
of perennials as I get older.

631
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:56,924
Trees and shrubs
are my friends.

632
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,693
And perennials,
I have to plant more natives

633
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,096
because I don't have
the time and effort and budget

634
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,566
to take care of all of that.

635
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,835
And sedges, you know,

636
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:12,506
Roy sent me down this path
and I have not stopped.

637
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:15,876
I have cut, I'm really proud
of the fact that I set a goal

638
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:19,213
of getting rid of half
of my turfgrass in seven years.

639
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,948
I did it in five.

640
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:25,385
And I figure I can probably
get rid of another 10% to 15%

641
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:28,488
and still have room for us,
the dogs,

642
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,791
all the nieces and nephews
who come to visit,

643
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:32,926
and our friends and family
who visit.

644
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:34,895
I didn't really need all that.

645
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:38,198
Once I got started,
it just kept going.

646
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,200
And then, I think all of us
as gardeners

647
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:41,401
have to draw the line somewhere.

648
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,170
For me, it was annuals.

649
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:46,273
It just wasn't,
you know, I had a big garden.

650
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,910
And so the good news was,
is I didn't need a lot of pots

651
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,945
and a lot of, and annuals now,

652
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:55,249
and I'm just on the edge of
learning about native annuals,

653
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:57,885
things like partridge pea,

654
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,322
variations of <i>Coreopsis</i>
and <i>Gaillardia</i> and others

655
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:05,726
that I can use
for solving problems,

656
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:10,531
filling in things,
and they will go away,

657
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,533
but they're serving a purpose.

658
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,402
They're my first responders.

659
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,337
Now, I love tonalities.

660
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:20,340
I learned that in my
fashion merchandising career.

661
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:25,078
But in the garden, I found they
could be a good tool for me,

662
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:28,115
for someone who didn't know
all the rules of gardening,

663
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,217
because they're very forgiving.

664
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:33,587
And tonalities are
just mixes of color,

665
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,656
yellow, orange, red,
white, green, silver,

666
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:37,958
that are easy on your eye.

667
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:41,195
And what I found is while
I'm experimenting and learning,

668
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:43,397
if I limit my color palette,

669
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,732
it almost makes me look
like I'm a better gardener

670
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,634
than I really am.

671
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:51,338
So, for instance, in the front
of the mullet house,

672
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:55,275
one kind of requirement
I came up with was,

673
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:57,411
well, everything
has to bloom white.

674
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,246
Now, it can start yellow
and turn white.

675
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:01,949
It can be white and turn pink,
that's fine.

676
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,818
But by making it mostly white,

677
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,055
no matter
how much craziness is going on

678
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:12,826
in any particular bed, it looks
pulled together, it looks calm.

679
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:14,695
And so when people come
to visit,

680
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,965
it looks like
I know what I'm doing.

681
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:21,001
In the back,
I like bolder colors,

682
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:24,705
but instead of doing really a
lot of bold, contrasting colors,

683
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,140
I kind of stick to yellow,
orange, and red.

684
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:29,610
It kind of is that
same tonality,

685
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:33,680
but it's for full sun
and it holds up to that.

686
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,049
And blue for me,
I don't know why,

687
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,484
has never been a favorite color.

688
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:41,054
Sometimes I think blue flowers
look almost unnatural.

689
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,956
Ha-ha.

690
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,993
I had this problem path that
I didn't know what to do with,

691
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,194
so I challenged myself

692
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:50,364
to use that blue-purple-lavender
palette.

693
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,567
And now when I walk
down that path,

694
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,103
my shoulders actually start
to come down.

695
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,838
It's so calming.

696
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:02,476
Now, the glass of wine in that
photo doesn't hurt, but...

697
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,344
[all laughing]

698
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:07,581
But I've learned to love
the use of tonalities.

699
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:10,017
And then finally,
the ultimate tonality to me

700
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,219
is just the power of green.

701
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:14,254
Not a flower in sight.

702
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:18,759
And green, while it is green,
is everything from almost yellow

703
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:22,896
to almost gray to almost blue
and everything in between.

704
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:26,667
And that's before you even get
to structure

705
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,468
and color and texture.

706
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:31,338
To me,
this is a journey of tonality

707
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,373
I'm gonna be on
for the rest of my life.

708
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,376
I think I'm just scratching
the surface.

709
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:40,180
Now, along the way, I developed
a couple of tools for me.

710
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,016
They may or may not
be helpful for you,

711
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:47,988
but, again, for the first
several years of my garden,

712
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:51,592
the property determined
my priorities,

713
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:54,628
and it was, I couldn't
quite get ahead.

714
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,930
And one day, and I'm not sure.

715
00:34:56,997 --> 00:35:00,234
I'll just chalk it up
to improvisation.

716
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,104
I was sitting there
with a piece of paper,

717
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:07,641
my property lines,
where the house was,

718
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,544
trying to figure out, like,
how do I get ahead of this?

719
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,379
Where I've been,
I was kind of, like,

720
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:15,315
playing whack-a-mole
in the property.

721
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:19,553
And somehow,
an old dartboard got involved.

722
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,424
I pulled off the top of it,
stuck it over my property,

723
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:29,196
and realized this was how
I was gonna prioritize.

724
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:32,699
The bull's-eye
and those first two rings

725
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,535
were where I spent
most of my time,

726
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:38,605
where I had the most resources,
the most access to water,

727
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:41,008
and that would be
where I would prioritize.

728
00:35:41,074 --> 00:35:45,179
And everything else had to,
the further out it got,

729
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:47,748
the more it had
to take care of itself.

730
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,917
Now, that doesn't mean
there isn't a lot of work

731
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,585
getting it to that point.

732
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,354
But now if I want to keep some

733
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:56,256
of those more exotic plants
or things

734
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,625
that don't contribute as much,
they're near the house.

735
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:01,028
And I've done a lot
of transplanting.

736
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:04,331
And natives have
really given me a leg up

737
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:06,466
on those farther-away areas,

738
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:09,369
that as I establish
those communities,

739
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,371
they can take care of themselves

740
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:14,675
a lot better
probably than I could.

741
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,611
I also came up with what I call

742
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,079
my garden building rule
of thirds,

743
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,815
and I don't know about you,
but when I started

744
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,417
planting beds
and reading what to do,

745
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:26,253
I would slavishly go over
these plans

746
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,423
and make pretty big investments
up front

747
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,391
in what I thought
it was supposed to do

748
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,994
and how the balance
between all the things were.

749
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:38,632
And I realized I wasn't
good enough for that to not,

750
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,768
for that to be good even
in a year or two or three,

751
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:46,573
that I really needed to cut back
on the planning by, you know,

752
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,543
and it's, now for me,
it's about a third,

753
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,445
and then a third reacting,

754
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:55,282
and then a third creativity
and improvisation.

755
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:59,686
So what I tend to do now is
overplant the ground cover layer

756
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:02,322
so I can get a leg up on weeds.

757
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,693
And in the focal layer,
what I call the focal layer,

758
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,962
where all the fun,
pretty stuff is,

759
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:13,700
I plant less, but more varieties
so that I have time

760
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:16,904
to see what happens
before I invest,

761
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,806
before I go out and get,
you know,

762
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,175
and make big statements.

763
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,010
But by that third year,

764
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,012
and it usually tends
to be about a third year,

765
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,947
give or take,
I'm ready to improvise.

766
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,116
It's like,
"Oh, I'm finally gardening.

767
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:31,118
"I want some more yellow
over there.

768
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,352
"And that didn't work,

769
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,021
so I'm gonna double
down on this."

770
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:38,225
All the while that that ground
cover layer is working for me,

771
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,160
and the tree and shrub
layer, also,

772
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,796
I spend about
the same amount of time.

773
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:48,001
And for me, that's, I've found
that to be a good balance.

774
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:53,006
Now, I'm gonna go quickly
through this next section,

775
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,776
because I have an obsession
with naming my beds,

776
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,845
as you've heard me say before.

777
00:37:57,911 --> 00:37:59,880
I have the Granny Garden,
the Sunset Landing.

778
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:02,182
I'm a sucker for a theme.

779
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,284
This is the Pollinator Garden.

780
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,820
This is the Golden Meadow.

781
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:11,191
This is what I call
the Transitional Triangle.

782
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:12,659
And it kind of holds together

783
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,862
because when you go
to the left of this bed,

784
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,363
it's a whole different thing,

785
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,165
and to the right
is a whole different thing.

786
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:20,400
And this is kind of
right on the verge

787
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,036
of kind of orderly and wild.

788
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:26,306
And then this is
the Hydrangea Haven.

789
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,842
Now, I always thought
of hydrangeas being

790
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:33,180
kind of old-fashioned and a
little granny and little bosomy.

791
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:36,850
But I've become
obsessed with them.

792
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:40,087
And now the entire front yard
of the mullet house

793
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:43,891
is circled with about
15 varieties of hydrangeas.

794
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:47,594
And I'm experimenting now with
even more native hydrangeas,

795
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,264
more <i>arborescens,</i>
more <i>quercifolias.</i>

796
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,999
I love it.

797
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,369
Quickly on plant selection,

798
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:57,905
I found, and I think all of us
like to save money.

799
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,174
So whether you have
a small garden or a big garden,

800
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,376
one of the things we used to say
in retail was,

801
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:04,778
"NPR: never pay retail."

802
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:07,080
Now, that's not fully true.

803
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:10,484
But we always said,
"As retailers,

804
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,120
"we know everything you want
is on sale somewhere.

805
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,389
You just have to find it."

806
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:17,925
And for me,
that became important.

807
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:20,928
And so I love
a past-season sale.

808
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:24,565
I love a clearance sale,
I love a one-day-only sale.

809
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:27,334
I could probably tell you
the promotional calendar

810
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,237
of every nursery
in a three-county area,

811
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,607
because I needed to buy
more quantity.

812
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:36,844
But the price you pay for that
sometimes

813
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,545
is less-than-healthy plants.

814
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:41,648
So one of my other rules:
don't buy pretty, buy healthy.

815
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,351
And I'm that guy
you'll see at the nursery

816
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:46,119
pulling everything
out of its pot

817
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:48,455
because I've,
and because I usually buy

818
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:49,857
when the plants don't have
flowers,

819
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:52,192
because I think
many of us know,

820
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:55,495
and I know as a retailer
for sure, I promise you this,

821
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:58,866
when that plant is in flower,
they're making the most money

822
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:01,068
they're ever gonna make
on that plant.

823
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:03,470
And most of us,
pretty quickly as gardeners,

824
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,973
learn that we don't
need to see the flower

825
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,742
to know whether
it's a healthy plant or not.

826
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,410
So I'm pulling it out.

827
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:11,945
Do I see the roots even?

828
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:14,615
Are they rotted,
are they root-bound?

829
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:15,949
Are they moldy?

830
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:19,953
And in some cases,
especially with big box stores,

831
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,589
is it a little plug
they put in a big pot,

832
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:26,360
and the root system
hasn't even developed yet?

833
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:30,030
Finally, I had to control myself
'cause I'm an impulse buyer.

834
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:33,600
So I literally keep
a pocket plant list in my pocket

835
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:35,202
all the time
when I go to nurseries

836
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,504
to try to keep myself on track.

837
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:40,407
It doesn't always work,
but I do.

838
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:42,976
And then finally,
learning about keystone natives

839
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:44,845
really helps me to focus
on those,

840
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:48,549
'cause I know I'll get
more bang for my buck with those

841
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,518
than I would with other plants.

842
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,655
I love the turn of a phrase,

843
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,723
so I will try to go quickly
through this, too.

844
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,025
You've heard some of these.

845
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:00,494
I'm a big believer
in the eye has to travel.

846
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:04,131
We love connecting dots,
that's how we see the world.

847
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,299
I love this phrase:

848
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:07,401
"Without a gardener,
there is no garden."

849
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,069
Gardening is disturbance.

850
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,404
Make it a beautiful one.

851
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,439
Take responsibility.

852
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:15,008
This was our Smith family motto
when I was a kid.

853
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,777
And I'll be honest,
I'd forgotten it.

854
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:19,213
"Live with it,
learn from it, build on it."

855
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:21,114
And it so fits nicely to me

856
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:24,952
with my improvisational piece
of live with it, accept reality,

857
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:29,456
learn from it,
add to it, and then build on it.

858
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,558
How you do anything
is how you do everything.

859
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,628
That's a Buddhist phrase
that I heard, and it's so true.

860
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:37,798
If you look at your life,
you know, your hobbies,

861
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:40,067
what you do for a living,
everything,

862
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,735
it's kind of how you do
everything

863
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:43,203
is how you do anything.

864
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,605
And what I didn't want to do

865
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:48,675
was spend so much time trying to
fix everything that was wrong.

866
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:52,613
I wanted to spend more time
doing what I was good at.

867
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,182
And I think that's true
in the garden too.

868
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:57,417
And finally,
and this is mine,

869
00:41:57,484 --> 00:42:00,954
the future is a place
we are making right now.

870
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,424
Every plant you plant,
every seed you sow,

871
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:08,562
you are creating
your own future in the present.

872
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:11,498
And I think that's so important
because I know

873
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:13,066
that I have had those days

874
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:15,202
where I just don't
want to think about it.

875
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,971
I don't want to deny,
I just don't want to deal.

876
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,473
But that means then,

877
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,076
that the future will show up
and smack me upside the head.

878
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:27,247
And I love knowing that
I get to decide every day

879
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,783
the future I'm planting.

880
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:36,089
Now, these last few slides
are just some tips that I use

881
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:38,592
that may be helpful for you,
and I, there are three.

882
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:41,562
One, I'm gonna go over
some improvisation tips,

883
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,463
some sustainability tips,

884
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,333
and a little about
good neighbor gardening.

885
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,036
So these are the slides,
I'll kind of read more

886
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:51,438
than I have up to this point.

887
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:54,241
The first rule of improv,
always say "Yes, and."

888
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:55,642
And what that means
in the garden

889
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:58,679
is work with what
Mother Nature gives you.

890
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,848
Add new information.

891
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,617
That's the other,
the next rule of improv.

892
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:07,888
And that really means make sure
your garden reflects you.

893
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:11,391
Then there is,
then you're beyond judgment.

894
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,493
Doesn't matter what
anybody says.

895
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,230
What's the one phrase I love?

896
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:20,234
"What you think about me
is none of my damn business."

897
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,470
I love that.
[audience laughing]

898
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,672
And it's kind of like,
what you think about my garden

899
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,040
is none of my damn business.

900
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,442
I love my garden.

901
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:30,644
And every garden I visit,

902
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:36,383
you can tell when it reflects
the person that has created it.

903
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,151
And when,
like in my early years,

904
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:42,022
when it looks like
somebody else's idea.

905
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,057
Be present.

906
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,359
Don't block or deny.

907
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,995
Embrace the reality
of what you're working with,

908
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:50,197
whether it's a large
or small garden,

909
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:53,400
whatever your budget is,
whatever your plants are,

910
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,904
it will be beautiful
the more you show up in it.

911
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,640
Understand the location
and relationship.

912
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:03,143
In improv, it's like,
who have I been identified as?

913
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,945
Where are we,
what are we doing?

914
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:08,282
In the garden, it's not just
that I live on this street

915
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:09,883
or in this neighborhood,
but, like,

916
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,221
I found out that my subdivision
had been a pig farm.

917
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,256
Well, what does that mean
about my soil?

918
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,492
And, you know, and then I was,
I found out

919
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,664
what my ecoregion was and
what plants used to grow there,

920
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,832
and maybe they still could.

921
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:28,535
And then finally,
you look good

922
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:31,104
if you make
your partner look good on stage.

923
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,273
Much the same way
that you look good

924
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,677
if you make
Mother Nature look good.

925
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:39,780
From a sustainability
perspective,

926
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,381
these are just five.

927
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:43,517
And I promise you,
there's dozens.

928
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,886
But these tips really
resonated with me.

929
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:48,989
And to me, they're
very straightforward and simple.

930
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,924
Reduce your lawn if you can.

931
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:54,261
Think area rug,
not wall-to-wall carpeting.

932
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:56,797
Remove invasive plant species.

933
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,165
Learn what they are.

934
00:44:58,232 --> 00:45:00,367
Now when I say remove, it sounds
like they're gone forever.

935
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:01,568
We all know better than that.

936
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:03,103
But do your best.

937
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,872
That's what I do.

938
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:07,708
Rethink pretty,
I've said it a few times.

939
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:09,309
Expect more from your plants.

940
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:12,212
Look for responsible beauty.

941
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:13,780
Plant for pollinators.

942
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,450
Really, just plant
for living things

943
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:19,286
and really identify
and plant keystone plants.

944
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:21,388
And finally, and my favorite,

945
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:25,993
start planting, even if it's
one native plant or one new.

946
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,662
And then if it works,
just keep planting more.

947
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:31,632
And if it doesn't,
just keep planting anyway.

948
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:35,202
Plant generously because plants
love to live in community.

949
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,370
Oops.

950
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:37,871
And then finally,

951
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:40,007
what I've noticed
in my own garden

952
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:42,843
and kind of as I've driven
through other areas

953
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,180
to seek inspiration
is that when I started

954
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:47,481
down this native journey,

955
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:50,951
it could look like
a hot mess really fast.

956
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:56,690
And if you live in an urban area
or a subdivision or the suburbs

957
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,993
and you're dealing with HOAs
or neighbors

958
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,330
who love to have an opinion
about everything,

959
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:05,999
these are just a few tips
to keep your garden

960
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:09,870
from being perceived as weedy
or unruly.

961
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:14,007
Limit your plant palette
by square footage.

962
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:16,176
The smaller the space
you have to work with,

963
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:18,178
limit the varieties of plants.

964
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:20,214
It will look more orderly.

965
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,882
Use borders and ground covers.

966
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,419
And I use borders
more now than ever.

967
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:28,422
I can take those sedges and not
just use them as a ground cover,

968
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:29,690
but use them as a border.

969
00:46:29,756 --> 00:46:33,760
And suddenly, the same person
can look at this bed

970
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,729
without a border
and this bed with a border

971
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,331
and think,
"Wow, that really looks like

972
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:39,366
he knew what he's doing."

973
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:41,935
You know, I love the phrase
Kelly Norris uses

974
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,704
called "orderly frames."

975
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,574
The minute you have borders
or pathways

976
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:53,213
or a good ground cover layer,
people perceive it as orderly.

977
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,416
Also, maybe stick with only
one to three plants

978
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,252
that are in bloom
at any given time,

979
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,721
because that's, again,
easy on the eye.

980
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:04,124
And then, you know, another one
to three each season.

981
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,593
And really think
in the front yard

982
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,862
if you're, especially
if you're in a smaller area,

983
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,031
about keeping those plants
no more than maybe

984
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:14,668
three to four feet high
and in the middle or the back.

985
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:16,637
And it seems simple,

986
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:22,943
but really, your eye does travel
and it goes until it's stopped.

987
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,414
And if it stopped in the front,
you're like, "What's wrong?"

988
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:31,652
If it doesn't stop
and it goes up to the house

989
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,620
and keeps going, it's at ease.

990
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:37,624
The eye just signals the brain
that everything's okay.

991
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,226
And these, I think,
and then, of course,

992
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:41,328
repeat, repeat, repeat.

993
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:45,232
Using fewer varieties
and fewer colors,

994
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,634
or fewer plants in bloom,

995
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:53,207
just creates a sense of ease
and not so much masses,

996
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:56,844
but drifts and ways that
your eye can connect those dots.

997
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,278
The neighbors will lean in

998
00:47:58,345 --> 00:47:59,980
instead of wondering
what you've done

999
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,015
or calling the HOA.

1000
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,186
Now, I'm near the end
of the presentation,

1001
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:08,188
and I wanted to leave
you guys with this

1002
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:11,158
because I know, over the years,

1003
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,928
one of my old goals was sort of,
like, keeping things alive.

1004
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,897
You know, I remember
one quote that's like,

1005
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:22,236
"Maybe it's not so much how
many plants die in your garden,

1006
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:25,372
but the fact
that so many actually live."

1007
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,674
And another quote I love,
and I'll share this with you,

1008
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,977
is 'cause I've been always
kind of more obsessed with,

1009
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:33,113
"Will it live and how long
will it live," and all that.

1010
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,049
Well, I love this quote
and I'm gonna read it.

1011
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:39,419
"Perhaps the gardener
is not someone

1012
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:44,691
"who makes forms last over time,
but over time, if possible,

1013
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:47,828
ensures that enchantment
survives."

1014
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:52,566
And what I love about that
is <i>you're</i> the enchantment.

1015
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:55,569
That <i>that's</i> what we bring
to the garden.

1016
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:58,772
Not so much that we got more
to live than die.

1017
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:01,842
Not so much anything other than,

1018
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:07,247
"It couldn't have been
anybody else's garden but ours."

1019
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,716
That is the end
of my presentation.

1020
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,351
My name is Patrick Smith again.

1021
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:13,887
Stay curious and have fun.

1022
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:15,389
Questions?

1023
