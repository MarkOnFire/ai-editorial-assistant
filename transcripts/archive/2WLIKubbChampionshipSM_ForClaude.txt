Kubb's an old Nordic game.

It comes from Sweden.

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,291
You throw these wooden batons
or sticks,

24
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,458
and you try to knock over
these wooden blocks.

There's a king
in the middle.

As soon as you knock over
the opponent's kubb,

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,250
then you can hit the king,
knock him over,

you win the game.
