00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:03,920
So how did Gilbert Stuart's
portrait of Washington 
become so popular?

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,548
Part of the reason
started with Stuart himself.

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,551
He made dozens of copies 
of this painting
during his lifetime.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,970
But it wasn't just Stuart 
who made copies.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,140
Lots of artists, both in America 
and around the world,

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,435
make copies of this painting
and a variety of different media.

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,354
All of this helped
spread the popularity of this image.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,357
While there are other paintings
and sculptures made of Washington,

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,361
Stuart's portrait is by far
the most widespread and recognizable.

10
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:32,115
Today, the painting is jointly owned
by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,160
and the National Portrait
Gallery in Washington, D.C..
