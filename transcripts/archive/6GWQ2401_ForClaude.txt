00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,375
I'm with the Houston

00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,853
And this is my tenth year.

21

25
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,732
Hanging over there.

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,669
Every year, I visit
all the quilt display.

27
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,272
I cry because every
single quilt is so pretty.

28
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,441
And this American tradition.

29
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:18,178
And plus I am--
myself, I'm a pharmacist.

30
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,280
I taught in the medical school.

31
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,183
But my hobby become
my business today.

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,253
Was my hobby since I was little.

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,455
I love every single thing's
beauty.

34
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,591
The beauty
is very important for me.

35
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,527
Everything in my eyes pretty,
include everybody--

36
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,362
I have a capability.

37
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,464
Anybody,
I meet you, over 10 minutes,

38
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,800
I can find a beauty
of inner you.

39
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:40,968
That's me.

40
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,837
So my hobby become my business

41
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,341
because Houston International
Quilt Show.

42
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,543
And I'm a mixed media person.

43
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,846
So today's--
Actually today's subject,

44
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,717
you see on your note,
is Fabric Mania.

45
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,820
Okay, I think not everybody
crazy like me,

46
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,355
but we have a lot of people.

47
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,856
We love fabric.

48
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,993
We love,
you know, all the fabric.

49
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,428
And then this year
I present here,

50
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,098
I will show you
all the possibility.

51
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,599
Use my stencil.

52
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,934
There's my-- Oh, next?

53
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,435
Okay, sorry.

54
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,571
Next subject
you will see here.

55
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,973
I say everything,
all the fabric you see,

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,742
every single pattern, quilt,

57
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,212
your apparel,
and your craft project.

58
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,947
There are two elements.

59
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,950
Construction,
construct your fabric.

60
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,486
First one is pattern or design.

61
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,188
You can see real thing here.

62
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,790
I try to bring
as many sample I could.

63
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,660
You see all the sample here,
including yourself.

64
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,029
Look at your T-shirt,
your apparel.

65
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,499
Everything has two construction,
two elements in there.

66
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,635
First one
is a pattern or design.

67
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,537
Second one is color.

68
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:54,241
So you can see I have
a sample here, a pattern.

69
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,611
And about pattern,
I will show...

70
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,514
use my stencil
because TSC Designs.

71
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,015
I'm a stencil company.

72
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,884
So I bring my stencil.

73
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:08,222
Every single patterned
quilt sample here or apparel

74
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,190
done with my template.

75
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,160
Only 2% is not from my template.

76
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,295
One is this one.

77
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,433
Did you see the first one
on the most left there?

78
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,236
See the tree,
birch tree, feather?

79
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,738
Those done by the art brush.

80
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,608
So this was not
from my template.

81
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:32,012
Directly you're drawing,
painting with art brush, okay?

82
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,148
And those brush, you can--
I just heard last week.

83
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,918
One lady talked to me,
say, "I'm not an artist.

84
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,120
I'm just, you know, in between."

85
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,657
Bring a decorate painter
to quilting

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,460
and bring quilter
to decorate painting.

87
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,596
I'm ambassador in between
those two groups.

88
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,798
So the lady last week told me

89
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,302
the brush is better use
acrylic paint.

90
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,871
So that sample
done with my ink.

91
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,774
But I will tell you,
last week, she showed,

92
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,578
"Joyce, better use acrylic paint
for those kind of brush."

93
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,714
So those brush,
if you use on the fabric.

94
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,449
If you don't mind,
you don't wash out.

95
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,218
You don't want
to wash your art quilt.

96
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,288
You can use an acrylic pen,
okay?

97
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,991
Next one,
you see the middle one.

98
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,693
There's another technique.

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,962
This my new technique.

100
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,031
This year, year 2024,

101
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,700
is my tenth year
with fiber arts.

102
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,101
And I'm so blessed.

103
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,972
This year's my most achievement,
most exciting year.

104
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,641
I have a couple,
my follower over here.

105
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,777
If you follow me,
you know every year

106
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:40,781
I will release one new project,
one new technique.

107
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:44,084
But start last year,
because my health--

108
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,452
I'm closer 80 year old.

109
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,421
Three more years,
I be 80 year old.

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,857
And I feel my physical,
my memory,

111
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,660
especially my memory
I feel from last year.

112
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:57,231
I decide I release
as much as I could.

113
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,968
So today you will see,
I put on a note.

114
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,169
I don't know you have note.

115
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,737
I see the PowerPoint.

116
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,139
I released about 12 to 13,

117
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,477
which include my number 10,
my new technique.

118
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,480
My new technique here this year,
I promise you.

119
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,982
Because you're my follower.

120
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,017
You know,
we are stencil company.

121
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,053
We do dabbing for stencil,
right, create a pattern.

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,023
This year, I have a new
invention I call collage.

123
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,859
And that will be my last one
I share with you.

124
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,462
My newest collage
stencil technique.

125
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,397
And another technique here.

126
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,466
Did you see this birch tree?

127
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,168
By the way, I love tree.

128
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,936
If you see my stencil design,

129
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,339
I love tree, love flower,
love leaf.

130
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,842
Because I can stay
in front of the tree.

131
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,778
I can enjoy the beauty
of tree for 30 minutes.

132
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,681
I can see the light, the shade,
everything.

133
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,517
I can stand 30 minutes,
enjoy the beauty of a tree.

134
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,352
So look at this birch tree.

135
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,520
I love birch tree.

136
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,688
Do you like this color?

137
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,856
See the color?

138
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,125
This now created
from my stencil.

139
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,161
This created with my
shaving cream technique.

140
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,963
Collage, okay.

141
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,334
So, by the way, I come here,
I will share with you.

142
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,138
Today's lecture's not really
detail about technique.

143
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,607
Technique, later,
you can take my class.

144
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,043
I play a video next year, okay?

145
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,711
You will learn that.

146
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,213
Today, release all light.

147
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,881
Open your mind.

148
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,283
This morning, when I wake up,
you know what?

149
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,119
I will change my subtitle
for this lecture.

150
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,856
We have <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

151
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:35,596
Now I change my title to
"Joyce in the Tsukineko Land."

152
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,965
Okay, my name is Joyce.

153
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,300
Now, next one,
we talk about color.

154
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,036
Color, we use Tsukineko ink.

155
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,839
This is my major present today.

156
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,975
Because I use Tsukineko ink.

157
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:52,546
And when you use Tsukineko ink,
do all your painting project.

158
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,215
You ask yourself,
you need to ask yourself.

159
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,451
There's two elements for you.

160
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,520
First one, I will say.

161
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,589
First part, medium.

162
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,727
Because so far, I bring
five medium here, okay?

163
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,997
So, when you use Tsukineko ink,
this water based,

164
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,267
so you can mix with all kinds
of different mediums.

165
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,670
At this moment, I will have
four additional medium.

166
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:20,207
So what kind of medium you are
use mixed with your ink?

167
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,877
Next question, ask yourself,
what applicator?

168
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,581
What's the tool
you apply your ink with medium?

169
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:31,518
So those two questions before
you start with your use of ink

170
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,920
and which technique.

171
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,355
Ask yourself
those two basic questions.

172
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,523
So you understand.

173
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,760
So today's lecture,
I give very brief outline,

174
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,397
very brief outline to learn
all those basic concepts.

175
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,634
Later, have your inner artist,
inner of you.

176
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:52,172
Release your inner artist in you
to create your own project.

177
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,907
Okay, so, next.

178
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,376
Here, medium and my tool, okay.

179
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,345
The tool,
I bring more than that.

180
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,913
So I have two tools here.

181
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,882
I just show you here.

182
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,651
This is our marbling tool.

183
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,421
This is my husband's invention.

184
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,292
So, everything, you can detach,
you can take apart.

185
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,529
This multiple tool, see here?

186
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,331
Have a nice different tip there.

187
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:21,101
You can unscrew, change the tip,
change the, you know, change...

188
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,436
Put it inside there.

189
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,971
So this is nice tip.

190
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,773
And I do all my marbling
with this tool.

191
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,977
And let me show you next one,
okay.

192
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,547
And water brush I show next,
okay.

193
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:37,584
See, now, before I show you
my technique,

194
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:41,221
ask yourself why we use
Tsukineko ink.

195
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,091
Everybody come here today

196
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,261
for coloring the fabric,
for craft your fabric.

197
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,663
So I use Tsukineko ink.

198
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,299
Before we start it,
you need to ask ourselves,

199
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,301
why there are so many
fabric ink,

200
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,203
fabric pen in the market?

201
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,372
Why we use Tsukineko ink.

202
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,341
At this moment,
I finally have a nice reason.

203
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,976
Okay, I organize.

204
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,112
First, most important one.

205
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,081
Because we are--
My book first.

206
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:13,754
I teach TSC Design, which
means Teacher Stamps Company.

207
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,456
So we major dealing
with the schools.

208
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,726
Special with the--
I mean, handicapped kids.

209
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,363
My sense of business
with a special ed teacher.

210
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,000
You see those handicapped kids,
they have no arm,

211
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,569
sometime no hand, no finger.

212
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,903
They use their foot.

213
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,138
They do dabbing.

214
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,774
Who invent this tool in Japan?

215
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,509
I have this tool.

216
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,111
Everybody know
about dabber, right?

217
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,881
If you get...
Jumbo dabber, small dabber.

218
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,916
Who invent this in Japan?

219
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,319
For me is Nobel Prize winner.

220
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,156
Before these two sponge, you
apply the ink to the stencil.

221
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:50,490
We use makeup tip.

222
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,593
We try use all kind of tool.

223
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,229
But it is very firm, no tilt.

224
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,231
So this is the best.

225
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,834
After invented, all the
handicapped kids can enjoy that.

226
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,237
Because I have
handicapped kids in my family.

227
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,572
So this is a wonderful tool.

228
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,877
And next one, child-safe
and very important.

229
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:16,617
You can see Tsukineko ink
called all-purpose ink.

230
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,685
What all-purpose ink means?

231
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:24,358
It means every single ink here
can work on any porous surface.

232
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,093
P-O-R-O-U-S.

233
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,530
Sorry, I have a stroke,
2014, in Paducah AQS show.

234
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,366
So it damage my language area.

235
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,268
I cannot pronounce "R" sound.

236
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,671
So if I say anything you don't
understand, raise your hand.

237
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,839
I can repeat.

238
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,341
But I'm so happy at PBS, Tina.

239
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,043
Thank you
for producer Tina.

240
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,814
She told me later this video
have captioning on it.

241
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,783
So they will do editing
at that time,

242
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,818
anything
I don't pronounce right.

243
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,021
I'm Chinese,
if I have a accent.

244
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,156
But later you see
the real video.

245
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,758
You will understand what I mean.

246
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,426
So all-purpose ink,

247
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,130
which means you work on
any kind of porous--

248
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:05,098
See, porous surface.

249
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,266
Can you pronounce that?

250
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,001
[laughs]
Porous surface.

251
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,169
So what does that mean?

252
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,337
From paper.

253
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,673
I have all the sample
in my booth here.

254
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,310
From paper to wood
to leather to gourd.

255
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,480
Last month, I was in Arizona.

256
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,518
There's a national
gourd convention there.

257
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:27,588
And I have group, gourd lady,
man come to my booth.

258
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,356
I say, "Oh, you make a gourd."

259
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,658
I know I have customer
make the gourd.

260
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,728
I say,
"Try this metallic color."

261
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,231
I told them,
"Try this metallic color."

262
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,498
You know what?

263
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,668
They go home, use this metallic,
try on their gourd.

264
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,470
Their gourd for $100,

265
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:47,174
after decorate with metallic,
become $300 apiece.

266
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,844
So gorgeous,
just another part of art.

267
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,179
Sorry, I don't have much time.

268
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:55,816
Otherwise, I will make
some gourd to show you, okay.

269
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,118
Okay, so this is porous.

270
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,021
And we didn't talk about fabric.

271
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:05,826
Quilters here, you know,
we are fiber artists here.

272
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:10,330
So everything-- You ask me,
what kind of fabric you can use.

273
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,366
So far,
I have all the challenge.

274
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,701
Everybody bring
the fabric to me.

275
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,503
None of them it doesn't work.

276
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,909
Every single fabric, Tsukineko
ink can work on top, okay?

277
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,745
You can see
my silk sample here.

278
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,246
See, from silk.

279
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,248
Actually, if you can...

280
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,885
I'd be glad to pass this out
to all the students here.

281
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,655
The reason, you feel that.

282
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,724
This silk's made from 100% silk.

283
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,695
It's 15 momme weight.

284
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,363
And this plain white on white.

285
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,731
See, white on white.

286
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,567
And I use my spray formula

287
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,569
create all the silk,
all the color.

288
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:52,506
Today you see every single--
my sample here.

289
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,275
Most of them,
I do color spray first.

290
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,710
And I will release.

291
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:01,148
This is my newest medium,
rubbing alcohol, okay?

292
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,516
So this a sample.

293
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,852
How about you, Marla,
you pass to everybody?

294
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,286
Touch the fabric.

295
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,688
This 100% silk.

296
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,523
It doesn't change texture.

297
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,493
So this very, very important
reason for us pick up this ink.

298
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,729
You don't want to change
your texture, right?

299
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,632
In the market, there's a lot
of wonderful fabric pen.

300
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,467
But the problem, you see,

301
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,836
the texture cannot compare this,
okay?

302
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,505
This second reason.

303
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,640
And soft touch, third reason.

304
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:27,808
Number four, washable.

305
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,009
Yes, very important.

306
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:32,513
When we use any ink,
any dye, any fabric thing,

307
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,781
ask yourself how many times

308
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:38,018
you can wash your quilt,
your fabric, okay?

309
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,419
Two times, ten times.

310
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,389
Tsukineko ink,
you can wash 100 times.

311
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,891
Colors still there.

312
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,994
And even you don't think about
you can bleach that.

313
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,564
End of January, my husband
will try bleach some of our ink.

314
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:51,732
It doesn't work.

315
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:52,933
But only one request.

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,401
Please write a note.

317
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,869
This note, number one.

318
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:58,138
When you play
with the Tsukineko ink,

319
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,774
I always ask you to heat set.

320
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,546
The reason because Tsukineko ink
is a pigment, right?

321
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,481
It's very fine, molecular.

322
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:11,118
So they use a polymer,
chemical polymer combined.

323
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:15,422
So after a polymer
binding with your pigment,

324
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:19,393
and they will interweaving
after it heat set.

325
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,163
Will interweave with your fiber,
which cause permanent.

326
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,666
It's not just on the top
of your fabric.

327
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,435
You're interweaving
with your fiber.

328
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,737
So which cause permanent, okay?

329
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,239
So do heat set.

330
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:36,443
Myself, at every single layer
I color or spray, I use--

331
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,111
I don't use iron.

332
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,113
Quilter has so much patience.

333
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,917
You put iron, put a protection
cloth on the top iron.

334
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,155
I just use my best tool,
best buddy: blow dryer.

335
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,924
So I always have
a blow dryer there, I blow-dry.

336
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,094
About less than a minute,
it heat set, okay?

337
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,496
But you can tell I speak fast,

338
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,099
I think fast,
everything fast, fast, fast.

339
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,169
So even I do my shaving cream
project in my class,

340
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,637
all the quilter.

341
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,405
I say, "Flatten shaving cream."

342
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,407
For me, 30 seconds, done.

343
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,077
For them,
two minutes to three minutes.

344
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,212
Everybody like doing
cement work.

345
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,848
Squeeze,
like perfect cement work.

346
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,416
Perfect, smooth.

347
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,454
So you can make
much more pretty pattern,

348
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,256
anything better than I do.

349
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,458
I have another confession
to you.

350
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:28,662
Every single sample here,
I don't make by myself.

351
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,131
I'm most clumsy person
in the world.

352
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,734
So today I can stand
in front of you,

353
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,402
present this technique.

354
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,838
It's kind of really
encouragement for you.

355
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,439
Because I was adopted,

356
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,610
all my brother, sister--
we have a choir in our family.

357
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,778
So I can sing, okay?

358
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,147
But rest of them,
they can play ping-pong,

359
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,483
play tennis, and play piano,

360
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,952
and they can do
all kinds of drawing.

361
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,687
I'm the only one sit over there.

362
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,189
I cannot do anything!
[audience chuckles]

363
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,456
So frustrated.

364
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,394
But, fortunately, I have
such wonderful creative idea.

365
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,297
So I'm here,
really encourage you.

366
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,232
The most clumsy person.

367
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,868
All my sewing skills is 606.

368
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,337
You know 404, 505, right?

369
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:14,408
404 for my adhesive
for my template to the fabric.

370
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,044
505 for your quilt sandwich.

371
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,679
And 606 for me.

372
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,414
I spray 606 spray.

373
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,583
High-temperature iron that.

374
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,184
And they were permanent stitch.

375
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,552
That's my sewing skill.

376
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,488
So every single sample here,
I designed the color

377
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,291
and from my stencil,
ideas from me.

378
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,393
And how somebody,
a lot of my friend

379
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,331
and a professional longarm
quilter making all my sample.

380
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,966
No matter who did that,

381
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,669
it never lost my most
important thing, the beauty.

382
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,138
So you see,
every single of my sample,

383
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,408
I never sacrificed
the beauty of my sample, okay?

384
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,177
So I share with you.

385
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,346
So now, what's washable?

386
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,516
Oh, heat set, or they say
permanent.

387
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,884
And, by the way, very good.

388
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,153
Everybody ask me, "Do I need
to pre-wash your fabric

389
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,022
before you jump to do this?"

390
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,557
You don't have pre-wash.

391
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:07,227
And you don't have buy the PTF,
pre-treated fabric, either.

392
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:10,364
Okay, number seven, oh, great.

393
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,966
A lot of scrapbooker here.

394
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,436
By the way, if you go to
New York Metropolitan Museum,

395
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,040
see, there's a big king-size
kimono present over there.

396
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,409
That piece over there,
over a thousand years.

397
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:26,146
So today, this Tsukineko ink
from Japan

398
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,649
has been in Japan--

399
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,219
You know, kimono market
over a thousand years.

400
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,288
So this is acid-free.

401
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,891
And color-fast and water-based.

402
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,726
So it's water-based.

403
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,263
So give you a wonderful,
wonderful opportunity.

404
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,665
It's water-based.

405
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,303
So any watercolor technique,
you can apply this ink, right?

406
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,974
So this is very fundamentally
very good ink for us to play.

407
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,709
And color, oh.

408
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,813
This last one
is my personal reason.

409
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,481
I enjoy color.

410
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,750
Everything in my eye,
the first thing is color.

411
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,321
So Tsukineko
is color-focused ink.

412
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,557
They have 39 non-metallic color.

413
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,093
They have six metallic color.

414
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,028
And I will suggest anybody--

415
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,298
If you don't use any ink
do any project,

416
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:22,336
at least buy one jar ink,
which is Champagne Mist.

417
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:26,673
This ink, shimmery ink, can make
every single color shimmery.

418
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,344
Oh, I don't wear my--
You can see my sample.

419
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,812
Okay, I'll go to my booth.

420
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,814
I didn't wear my apron.

421
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:37,951
So this ink, just need
add water and you do spray.

422
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:41,922
See, that piece
is my embroidery, harder.

423
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,492
You can see frosty white
on the top.

424
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,163
By the way, I welcome you
to take a picture of my sample.

425
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,067
I want you to learn every
possibility how to use this ink.

426
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,969
Okay,
so this is the last reason.

427
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:57,704
Color-focused.

428
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:01,708
So here, you can see
all workstation color fabric.

429
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:06,446
By the way, there's
two products for this project.

430
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,050
One's ink, one's marker.

431
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,188
Have you heard about
Fabrico marker?

432
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,523
Just treat it
like a Sharpie marker.

433
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,358
Any Sharpie marker can play.

434
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,093
Use the Fabrico marker.

435
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,828
And this is my color chart.

436
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,465
So here there's
six Fabrico marker set

437
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,402
from lightest color,

438
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,740
Victorian lady color,
and primary color,

439
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,743
and bold color,
and landscaping dark color.

440
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,580
Any color doesn't belong
to those five groups.

441
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,648
I will say weird color
is number six.

442
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:45,619
So you can use every single
color, coordinate with your ink.

443
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,788
And this year,
I bring new technique.

444
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,989
But I think-- I don't know.

445
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,591
I don't want to tell
manufacturer.

446
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,758
You know what?

447
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,126
There's no white marker.

448
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,528
Did you see Tsukineko ink?

449
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,530
Doesn't have a white marker.

450
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:59,533
Doesn't have metallic marker,
right?

451
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,535
So we will create one.

452
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:02,703
How?

453
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,571
I think I just
show you right now.

454
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,306
Very easy, okay.

455
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,543
See, this is the
Tsukineko applicator.

456
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,612
I just say the second meeting.

457
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,214
You need to ask yourself,
what's applicator?

458
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,083
So every single sample here,

459
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,019
you need to know what's
the medium for that

460
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,154
and what's applicator, okay?

461
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,223
So later, you have any
questions, you can ask me.

462
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,393
Basic from these two elements
for all my sample.

463
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,262
So these are Tsukineko ink.

464
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,265
They come out
with three packets.

465
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,767
Different size, the same theory.

466
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,470
When Tsukineko
design their tool

467
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:40,374
exactly like what they design
their Fabrico marker.

468
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,276
Each marker have two end.

469
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:46,013
One is a brush tip,
like brush tip, okay.

470
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,515
One is the bullet tip,
round tip.

471
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,585
So brush tip,
you treat like a brush.

472
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,353
Like blending the color, brush.

473
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,324
A bullet tip, you can sign your
name, right, with bullet tip,

474
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:00,060
or you do the color
in the middle, okay.

475
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,696
Later, every single tool--

476
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,133
I have individual package.

477
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,968
Show you how to do in a sample,
okay?

478
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,637
Right now, I give you
a very brief idea.

479
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,306
So use is fantastic.

480
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,408
And you dip your ink.

481
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,911
So you can dip in the white ink,
create a white marker, right?

482
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:21,014
You can dip this
in the metallic ink.

483
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:23,584
You can create
a metallic color, you know?

484
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,721
So this will open your world
for use marker.

485
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:31,425
And with my marker,
with all the color.

486
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,061
And that's what--
Later, I'll show you.

487
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:38,599
I think I have three
big breakthrough this year.

488
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:45,339
One is how to use Fantastic,
color your fabric.

489
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:49,343
Before, I have a dream
for Houston show.

490
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,011
Ten year ago, I have a dream.

491
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,480
I say, my creator, I say,
"Is it possible

492
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,849
give Joyce a piece
of white fabric?"

493
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,852
At that time, I didn't think
of any colored fabric.

494
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,822
I just want a piece
of white fabric.

495
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,524
Can I make a pattern?

496
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,225
Can I make a color?

497
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,894
Sure, a pattern from what?

498
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,896
From my stencil, right?

499
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,130
And color from what?

500
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,398
From Tsukineko ink.

501
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,367
So that time, it was a dream.

502
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,702
Give Joyce
a piece of white fabric.

503
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,006
Now, 10 years later,
this year's special.

504
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,942
This year is my big--
I'm so happy this year

505
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,813
because this year, I can
do color from white fabric,

506
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,448
white-on-white fabric.

507
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,184
I have all the sample here.

508
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,154
And this year, I colored
the color fabric.

509
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,323
You know, all the color fabric.

510
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,825
So who will take my next--

511
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,360
Today, I have three classes.

512
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,662
Every day, I have one class.

513
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,163
I told all my students,

514
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,899
"Bring a piece
of challenging fabric,"

515
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:48,268
which means ugly fabric

516
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:52,005
or which fabric you bring
from your UFO project.

517
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:55,542
Or some quilter designer,
I saw her video.

518
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,212
She called
"husband bin fabric."

519
00:22:58,278 --> 00:22:59,446
You know what I mean?

520
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:02,416
So any fabric you have,
old or ugly.

521
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,584
You don't know.

522
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,253
You have lots, lots
scrap fabric, I know.

523
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,256
By the way, all the lady here,
I will say,

524
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,258
American lady,
you are so blessed.

525
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:13,160
We're sitting here,
enjoy this lecture,

526
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,561
enjoy the quilting.

527
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,797
Everybody before,
I don't know.

528
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:17,965
Later, I know why.

529
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,499
They have one longarm machine.

530
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,934
Next day, they have two.

531
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,269
The other one say three.

532
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,038
Oh, like husband collect car.

533
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,774
[audience laughs]
So how blessed we are, you know?

534
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:28,942
There's one thing.

535
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,611
In the meantime,
I give you a challenge.

536
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,614
People come here
not just for present.

537
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,617
I'm Chinese,
but I'm an American citizen now.

538
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:39,653
I love beauty, I enjoy quilting.

539
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,057
I think American quilting is the
most beautiful as our heritage.

540
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:46,793
But I really worry
about something, one thing.

541
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,563
Look our age, you know,
on the floor.

542
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,199
Wisconsin show, a lot
of young people here, okay?

543
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,569
It's different, a lot of
young fiber artists here.

544
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,071
But regular show,
you're on the floor,

545
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,007
you see all gray hair.

546
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:01,175
You can tell our age.

547
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,342
We will go.

548
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,011
One day,
we'll be bye-bye, right?

549
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,746
Who will take care,

550
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,917
take over this beautiful
American heritage, quilt, right?

551
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:13,153
So that's why
I have two challenge for you.

552
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,722
First one, my personal,
my company,

553
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,926
we sponsor a lot of
young people, young generation,

554
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:21,628
including the lady
make my PowerPoint.

555
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:22,996
I really worry to death.

556
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:25,566
I don't know anything
about PowerPoint.

557
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,835
In three weeks, I present here.

558
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,204
You know, God sent me an angel.

559
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,508
A week before Madison show,
I met a young girl.

560
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,677
She finished purchasing.

561
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:37,845
She say, "Xie xie."

562
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,047
I said, "Oh,
how you know your Chinese?"

563
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:42,349
She said Chinese "thank you,"
you know?

564
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,818
And so make my attention,
and we have a chat.

565
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:47,754
Oh, she's a wonderful,
young generation.

566
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,723
Do all the funky things

567
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,593
that even you don't know
what's going on on the Internet

568
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,762
and what, even,
I don't know, TikTok.

569
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,531
She showed me
what they are doing,

570
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,499
what convention
they're going, da-da-da.

571
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,602
I said,
"Wow, this is my market."

572
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,004
Okay, anyway, so she's computer.

573
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,406
She helped me do this here
last night.

574
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:10,277
See how beautiful present here
from this young generation?

575
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:13,680
So, after I taking care
of everybody here on the floor,

576
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:17,684
I will start making funky things
for our next generation.

577
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,353
We do need new blood, right?

578
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,089
Next challenge for you is--

579
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:24,124
This year,
I will see revolution.

580
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,694
After I finish all my lecture,
you can see.

581
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:31,164
You can use any fabric,
the one existing.

582
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,133
But don't tell my store friend.

583
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,335
Or my fabric store friend
will kill me.

584
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,604
"Joyce, [laughs]
all the fabric."

585
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,774
But if you use large pieces,
you're go ahead to buy, okay?

586
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:43,043
Mine's for art quilt,
for something fun.

587
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,711
I will show you later.

588
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:47,247
So I called it revolution.

589
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:51,818
After this class,
think about, you know,

590
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:55,656
from inner side of you,
understand the concept.

591
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:59,693
Create your own fabric,
go with your quilting.

592
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,029
Because I'm no quilter.

593
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,497
Last year, I was here.

594
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:04,965
I sit in the lunchroom.

595
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:09,002
The lady showed me
her winning piece-- Bargello.

596
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,737
I love Bargello pattern.

597
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:13,640
And she showed me
the back of the quilt.

598
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:16,143
It opened the door for me.

599
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,312
And that's what I like
present here.

600
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:23,784
So, you know, Bargello have
about 10 to 12 or 13, 14 or 36.

601
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:27,287
I see some people use 36
different fabric, make pattern.

602
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:28,989
And their pattern--
She showed me the back.

603
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:30,157
I understand.

604
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,425
Have all the number.

605
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,927
Number one, number two,
fabric, all different.

606
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,230
And finally make a Bargello.

607
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:38,999
So last week,
I talked to one of my friends.

608
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,502
She make AQS winner's quilt.

609
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:42,970
It's a Bargello.

610
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,137
I was so excited.

611
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,806
I said,
"Oh, we can work together.

612
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,175
"You show me
how many fabric you want.

613
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:51,912
I will take care of those fabric
and you make a quilt yourself."

614
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:55,949
So this the same challenge,
same revolution for you.

615
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:58,785
I think next year,
I will make more--

616
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:01,688
See, all my stuff,
no quilt block.

617
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,557
I don't like traditional block.

618
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,492
But now I changed my mind.

619
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,430
But even older, you know,
a log cabin or Ohio star.

620
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:11,832
Those are very basic.

621
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,700
For me, too mechanic;
I don't like.

622
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,769
But now, I give it new life

623
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:18,338
because I will create
their fabric.

624
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,675
So use the fabric you create,
do your quilt pattern.

625
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:22,976
Is that wonderful?

626
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,278
Give yourself applause.

627
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,480
I think it's wonderful,
wonderful idea, okay.

628
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:29,983
So, next, let me go to next,
this product, okay.

629
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,186
Now we talk about
ten techniques, okay?

630
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:33,353
I just make quick.

631
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,988
Use shaving cream background.

632
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:38,525
By the way,
if anybody haven't seen

633
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:41,061
my husband demo
for shaving cream,

634
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:42,863
raise your hand.
- Attendee 1: I have.

635
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,598
- Oh, only, oh.

636
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,034
80% haven't, okay, oh.

637
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,902
Please go to my booth.

638
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:52,639
I'm the 100 aisle, the
first aisle, the first booth.

639
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,409
Please go there,
see the basic, basic,

640
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:58,345
basic shaving cream marble
with the ink, okay?

641
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,080
There's much to see.

642
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:03,150
Otherwise, you have no idea
what I build up on top of that.

643
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,653
So this shaving-cream
background, look at there.

644
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,488
See the giraffe, see the flower?

645
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:11,158
Those I use my mushroom tip.

646
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:14,027
I use my mushroom tip creator.

647
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:16,230
See here?

648
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:18,999
Those are all created
with mushroom tip.

649
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,301
I create a border, okay?

650
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,338
So see how many possibilities
you can use my tool.

651
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,006
So this is
shaving cream background.

652
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,775
With shaving cream,
create a border or sashing.

653
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,344
So, technique one.

654
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,512
Technique two.

655
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,247
Look at my marble pattern.

656
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,116
This book,
I will publish next year.

657
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:41,121
I have Turkish, Chinese,
Japanese, French, Russian.

658
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,589
I have all different country.

659
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:46,193
The marble pattern
with my marbling tool.

660
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,695
I just show you,
I use this tool.

661
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:51,965
I have nine different tip,
create all the marble pattern.

662
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,567
And here only one color.

663
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,636
By the way, I like bold color.

664
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,504
You can see all this
very bright color.

665
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,739
Think about yourself.

666
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:00,707
You have your color preference,

667
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:03,243
the pastel color
or landscaping color.

668
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,113
See how many patterns
you create for your fabric,

669
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,048
for your quilting later.

670
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,349
Good idea.

671
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,352
This is my marble, okay,
marble background.

672
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,222
Number three,
applying color to dark fabric.

673
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,390
Okay, simple.

674
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,392
Here, you can look at here.

675
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,660
Dark-colored fabric.

676
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:22,796
And this is my new fabric
I call patina fabric.

677
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:26,066
When I was in COVID,
I created a whole fabric.

678
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:29,269
Okay, see,
I use a metallic color.

679
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,106
Applicator is a sponge.

680
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,875
I have a wonderful...

681
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,043
Anyway, sorry.

682
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,079
I have a art sponge
in my booth, okay?

683
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:43,951
I use sponge, create all this
very organic pattern.

684
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:48,856
Okay, and this one,
I especially need...

685
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:50,824
Show you this piece.

686
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:54,328
This piece is in memory
of Nancy Zieman.

687
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:56,864
Nancy interview me
before she passed away.

688
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,866
Two years before she passed.

689
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,235
She interviewed me in her booth
on the TV show

690
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:05,239
only for five minutes,
but every viewer call me.

691
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,673
This beautiful piece.

692
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,242
She cannot believe it.

693
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:12,913
Even myself, when I first make
this border, the sashing,

694
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,248
did you see that part?

695
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,083
I cannot it believe myself,
either.

696
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,752
You can make such
a beautiful fabric out.

697
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,621
How?

698
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:23,090
By the way,
when you use the ink,

699
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:26,426
try to make your own color
library and write it down.

700
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,096
Otherwise, you will forget
the formula yourself.

701
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:33,600
So here I use a frosty white
with the lightest pink color.

702
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:37,070
Using sponge,
create that border color.

703
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:41,241
Later, I will donate this in
memory of Nancy in her library.

704
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:44,511
Okay, she is a wonderful
mentor for me.

705
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:46,313
Oh, this is one piece.

706
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,448
Okay, dark-colored fabric.

707
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:52,486
All the detail I will mention
in my class or later in my video

708
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:54,721
because the color--
when you want color

709
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,390
on top of metallic color,

710
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:59,159
you need use number 14,
mint green.

711
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,727
Create a green color.

712
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:04,131
You need to use
number 33, rose pink.

713
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,233
Create a pink color.

714
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,268
Red color, okay,
there's a formula.

715
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,671
So next one, spray color.

716
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:14,408
Oh, this is most easy project.

717
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:17,144
I wish everybody
go home to try.

718
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,546
2014 is my big year for me.

719
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,115
I have a stroke in April,

720
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:25,152
but November, I have
two big breakthrough.

721
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,721
One is,
before, I mix my ink.

722
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:30,057
Always mix with what,
water, right?

723
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:32,326
So now, I don't know
what's the reason.

724
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:36,530
I mix with either 70%
or 91% rubbing alcohol.

725
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:42,803
I personally love 91%
because it evaporate faster.

726
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,938
And that's me-- fast.

727
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,074
So you can use 70%, okay?

728
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,944
70% rubbing alcohol
mixed with your ink.

729
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:54,815
The portion is in my book, okay?

730
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:56,683
The formula is in my book.

731
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,820
And anyway, if you like it,
you come to my booth.

732
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:02,322
I probably let you take
a picture, okay.

733
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:03,757
What's the formula there?

734
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:06,493
In my class,
you will practice there.

735
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,662
Oh, by the way, very important,
write the note.

736
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:12,266
For you, metallic ink,
you don't mix with alcohol.

737
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,567
Will deposit.

738
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:17,604
Metallic ink, you need to mix
with water only, okay?

739
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,873
Note second,
write a second note.

740
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,375
Okay, this spray, oh, spray.

741
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,443
I just showed the sample.

742
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,546
Where is--
I think I have that piece.

743
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,981
Can you pass that,
my silk scarf here?

744
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,950
See the sample here?

745
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:34,288
The beauty of spray,
why I love this formula,

746
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:36,256
nothing that easy.

747
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,892
You can create ombr color.

748
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,227
Do you see color?

749
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,296
You over-layer
about two or three inches.

750
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,597
So nature.

751
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:46,266
You don't need to hang out
in the yard, do all color.

752
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,102
This very nature,
ombr color.

753
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,404
Gradient color come out.

754
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,706
So this is the beauty
of spray, okay?

755
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,242
And then next one,
I just mentioned.

756
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,411
I don't know
you can see that clear or not.

757
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:01,215
I showed this particular sample
because after I spray--

758
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,017
Did you see the
white-on-white pattern?

759
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,520
Can you see the silver part?

760
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,856
I wish you can see
the silver part.

761
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:12,292
Add the beauty of your
touch-up of your design.

762
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,961
Use Fantastic.

763
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:18,599
That's what this year--
I have a lot of technique.

764
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:20,901
Use Fantastic.

765
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:23,537
I dip with the silver ink,

766
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:26,507
platinum ink, and outline
of your pattern.

767
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,774
See how pretty.

768
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,810
Later, I wish you can take
a detailed look.

769
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:33,614
So use this idea, you can
highlighting your pattern.

770
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,351
Okay, so make a prettier quilt
or pattern come out.

771
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,087
And this one is interesting.

772
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,422
I think I bring over here.

773
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,458
I like to share with you.

774
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,227
See, this whole bundle
cost me $70 or $80.

775
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,930
I just buy the white, you know?

776
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:53,267
Past two year
in the fabric market,

777
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:57,504
a lot of patterned fabric come
out with white with texture.

778
00:33:57,571 --> 00:34:00,107
Oh, they bring a big world
for us.

779
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:01,542
See this white?

780
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:02,709
And then I spray.

781
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:03,877
See how pretty?

782
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:05,145
So I use all my ink.

783
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,247
By the way, you know the ink
is water-based, right?

784
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:08,415
Watercolor.

785
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,117
You can mix, create a new color.

786
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,319
Think about how many color
you can custom-make

787
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:13,654
for your quilt pattern.

788
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,821
So all here.

789
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,590
See all the color like a candy?

790
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,692
I created
with my spray technique.

791
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:21,528
Okay, so these two things
are special.

792
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:23,363
I want to share with you.

793
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,098
Okay, next.

794
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,501
Okay, stenciling.

795
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:30,504
Oh, stencils are my business,
our stencil company.

796
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,906
So look at all this
from my stencil,

797
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:34,741
from my pattern, all here,

798
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:39,413
from my stencil plus my inking
technique, okay?

799
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:42,549
Number six,
color white-on-white.

800
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:45,052
White-on-white fabric,
I have a challenge.

801
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:48,021
Because somebody told me,
"Quilter don't use

802
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,424
white-on-white
on their quilting."

803
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,658
I don't know.

804
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:54,528
I need you help me to prove
or tell me it's good.

805
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,296
Because white-on-white--

806
00:34:56,363 --> 00:35:00,434
You can see all
my white-on-white pattern.

807
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,768
See this piece?

808
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,771
I have so many things
of white-on-white.

809
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:06,607
Let me see...

810
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:07,875
Here, see.

811
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:10,744
The fabric, all the sample,
all is white-on-white.

812
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:14,948
After spray, you see the color,
the pattern stand out.

813
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:17,518
And very interesting,
I show later.

814
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:20,754
Number seven, discharging
on dark-colored fabric.

815
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:24,791
Okay, see, this quilt,
when I do the discharging--

816
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:27,127
I didn't bring with me
because I flew in.

817
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,196
So I bring the medium.

818
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,799
Use Clorox, Soft Scrub
with bleach.

819
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:35,302
Clorox with bleach, okay?

820
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,837
With a sea sponge.

821
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:39,306
The medium is Clorox
with bleach.

822
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:42,242
Like, cleaning the bathroom,
with a sea sponge.

823
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,645
I use Kona cotton fabric.

824
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,181
It's heavyweight fabric.

825
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:48,849
So that create a whole thing.

826
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:51,685
This is my butterfly
and all my design.

827
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:53,453
One stencil
create all the pattern.

828
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,289
And by the way,

829
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,859
after you take color out,
can you add color back?

830
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:02,129
Okay, if you my student,
you listen to my lecture.

831
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:04,998
Later I see your quilt work,
I see your work.

832
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,534
If you just say one color
there, I walk by.

833
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:08,702
I don't know you.

834
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:10,370
I will pretend I don't know you.

835
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,172
Because after you take
all the note,

836
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,875
all classes,
you at least enjoy color.

837
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,977
At least put two color there,
right?

838
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,913
Like this one, I take color out.

839
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,883
Okay, I have a real simple here.

840
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:25,152
I use Kona cotton fabric.

841
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:28,055
See the brown color
from black fabric

842
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:29,823
and with a discharge.

843
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,525
My butterfly, look at.

844
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:32,726
Do I add color back?

845
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:35,729
I add number 66, thyme green,

846
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,898
which is my favorite one
of my favorite ink.

847
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,366
Create a whole piece.

848
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:43,103
Okay, so this is
for discharge project.

849
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,239
Next one.

850
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,576
Number eight,
oh, coloring lace.

851
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:50,911
Is that fun?

852
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,312
This all from my class.

853
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,348
Before, if you read my book,

854
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:56,583
first couple page,
I colored the lace,

855
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,385
took me about an hour.

856
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:01,388
Use a brush,
use color hue to color.

857
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:03,423
Took me one hour do that.

858
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,093
Now, three minutes by spray.

859
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,262
And the beauty of spray,

860
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:11,565
if you don't like color,
you can respray.

861
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:14,968
So always have a square fabric
or lace with you.

862
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:16,403
Try the color.

863
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,805
Until a color come out pretty,
write it down.

864
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:20,507
Make your own color library,
okay?

865
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,675
Go home and try that.

866
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:23,410
See, this is my lace classes.

867
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:24,811
I think it's beautiful.

868
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,547
And you can spray the front.

869
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,315
You can spray the back.

870
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:30,717
So you can-- So many try
with a piece of lace.

871
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:32,519
This is my number eight.

872
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,221
Number nine.

873
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:36,023
This really amazing.

874
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,191
Look at this.

875
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,860
Did you see the black
and white fabric there?

876
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:43,230
There's so many black
and white fabric in the market.

877
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,232
Look after I colored.

878
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:46,834
Isn't it amazing?

879
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,001
Look at the color.

880
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,469
That's my favorite.

881
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:53,540
I-- This year's a couple
of my favorite one.

882
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:55,576
See the color?

883
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,411
This is a real thing.

884
00:37:57,477 --> 00:38:00,914
It's original, it's just
a black and white.

885
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,884
So, if you take my class,
you'll enjoy.

886
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,919
It's an unbelievable color
come out.

887
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:07,588
Total change your fabric.

888
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:11,558
So that's why I say use your
UFO project or husband bin

889
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,926
or your scrap fabric.

890
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:14,995
Modify, make it prettier.

891
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:17,331
Okay, next one is number nine.

892
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:18,966
Coloring fabric
with Fabrico marker

893
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,501
or Fantastic Foam Tip
by applying ink.

894
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:23,303
Yeah, see this have
that beautiful set

895
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,138
of white T-shirt there.

896
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:26,907
See how many color there.

897
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:28,375
It's very hard, so detailed.

898
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,843
Hard to do the color.

899
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,145
So I use
Fantastic fill-in color.

900
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:36,884
Especially if you--
Before my quilt start this year,

901
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,218
before any of my sample,

902
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:41,722
you can tell I don't do
outline of the pattern.

903
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:43,590
When you finish your outline,

904
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,826
your pattern make
a darker shade.

905
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,228
Use marker,
darker color outline there.

906
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,297
Make whole thing pop out, okay?

907
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:51,732
Try to use that idea,

908
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,401
but don't do every single one
with dark color shade.

909
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:56,303
Okay, just add the beauty.

910
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,938
And this is my embroidery.

911
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,106
See the embroidery?

912
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,641
I color everything.

913
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:03,043
This from BERNINA
machine.

914
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,912
Number nine.

915
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,680
Coloring fabric--
The same thing.

916
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,815
Oh, can you see this one?

917
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:12,019
This is my top favorite
this year.

918
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:18,725
It's unbelievable because
there's so many fabric come out.

919
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,494
I can show the one piece.

920
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:22,529
You know,
how many have this fabric?

921
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:24,431
Did you see
those fabric pattern?

922
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:25,599
Right?

923
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,901
And you see big quilt made
from this fabric.

924
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:29,837
And made by the color fabric.

925
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:31,705
Now you know what.

926
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,240
Spray.

927
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,108
White on white, right?

928
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:37,044
Hello, wake up.
[laughs]

929
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,680
White on white and the spray.

930
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,782
See the total color.

931
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,917
So you can make your color now.

932
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,753
Okay, that's the basic idea
how to spray.

933
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,223
And another thing I like.

934
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,092
I love ocean, I'm very excited.

935
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,263
I was in Miami Airport
one bookstore three years ago.

936
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,467
I look at a book,
had ocean, swimming pool color.

937
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:02,369
I want make the color.

938
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:05,005
And this year, I made it
because my spray.

939
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,941
Look at this piece
of fabric I spray.

940
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,710
See how pretty color?

941
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:11,845
Even you want do painting,
drawing,

942
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,914
it hard for you to create color
like that.

943
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:16,550
Use your spray
or use a shaving cream.

944
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,452
Okay, so look at this.

945
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,021
This a little piece of my
sample, but I show you.

946
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,191
Is it a pretty--
This is a ocean color.

947
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,527
There's no way
I can do painting, drawing

948
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:27,895
in the two color like that.

949
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:31,365
I use this texture fabric
and I spray.

950
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,735
So think about you
can create landscaping color.

951
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:37,037
You can create a sunset color.

952
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,272
Get idea?

953
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:40,607
So from this spray
from the shaving cream,

954
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:42,676
you can create
any background landscape

955
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,478
in your fabric,
making your quilt.

956
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:47,314
So this is my--
Okay, another favorite

957
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,116
I wish you can all--
the left one.

958
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:50,317
Did you see the left one?

959
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,619
The little bitty thing?

960
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:55,389
That's from piece
of the same thing,

961
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,724
from piece of white fabric.

962
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,494
Did you see the background
is white-on-white like that?

963
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,996
And after I spray,
see the same thing.

964
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:05,399
I spray the color,
create a color.

965
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,267
Do you see the little flower
there?

966
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,336
Use Fantastic color.

967
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,105
Think about
how many beautiful fabric

968
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:14,408
you'll create your
own pattern.

969
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,543
Highlighting, totally make
a difference.

970
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,846
Do you see
the two piece different there?

971
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:22,182
That's what the purpose for
this class, for this lecture.

972
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:26,386
I want you modify your
own fabric with all my--

973
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:28,956
The pattern,
you do your quilt pattern

974
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:31,792
with my sense of color
with Tsukineko ink.

975
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,862
Okay, one of my customer,
my student,

976
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:36,897
bought this from JOANN Fabric.

977
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:39,099
Did you see the most right
one?

978
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,902
JOANN Fabric--
Before, it's nothing.

979
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,971
But after we color...

980
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:48,275
Especially if you can take
detailed look at all line.

981
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,944
Did you see the petal
on the left?

982
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:53,247
I used the frosty white.

983
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:56,750
Use a frosty white,
outline the leaf,

984
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,853
and then, in the middle part,
I use a copper.

985
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,623
Use round tip Fantastic,
do it in the middle.

986
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:06,293
And then blend the color
with orange, with apple green.

987
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,495
Okay, so this one idea.

988
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,430
And then, this is simple.

989
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:12,866
I don't know, I have probably
not on my screen.

990
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,968
I just--
Actually, I'll show you.

991
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:19,473
When you talk about tool,
I have one called aqua brush.

992
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,542
You use my--
Oh, here.

993
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,912
This one special,
not just a brush.

994
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:26,380
I would call aqua brush.

995
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:32,119
But this one you can take apart,
put water inside this reservoir.

996
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:33,787
And here it say push.

997
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:36,823
You push, continuous water's
coming out

998
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,026
so you can do watercolor.

999
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:43,163
Instead of dip the ink-- dip
a brush, the water continues.

1000
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,499
Very smooth, cool water,
so that's my--

1001
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,735
Look at here, my ocean--
ocean odyssey.

1002
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:50,237
Did you see those--

1003
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:52,139
the ocean wave
from this technique?

1004
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:54,208
Okay, and by the way,

1005
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:57,211
I'm the person, I don't like
a very rigid pattern.

1006
00:42:57,277 --> 00:43:00,480
I like everything
have free spirits, free mood.

1007
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:03,016
I like watercolor,
like my T-shirt here.

1008
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,818
This, I can make it, okay.

1009
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:08,388
In the future, I will teach you
how to make the pattern color

1010
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:11,024
like my T-shirt or my dress.

1011
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:14,228
Here, the watercolor,
you can draw in

1012
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:15,796
or you can use my stencil,

1013
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:19,199
and then use aqua brush,
create blending, bleeding.

1014
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,534
Make it like a watercolor.

1015
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,070
So this is another tool
I share with you.

1016
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:24,705
And what other goody?

1017
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:25,873
Okay, one--

1018
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,842
Oh, here, my new technique,
okay.

1019
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,577
Number 10.

1020
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:33,413
10A, new technique.

1021
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:37,718
This what I promised you
at the end of the presentation.

1022
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,554
I will show you my
new collage stencil.

1023
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:43,056
See, this is my
four season tree.

1024
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,493
And those tree, traditional way,

1025
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,030
we use my jumbo dabber dab ink
to stencil, right.

1026
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:52,432
Like my tree of life here.

1027
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,501
Look at the tree.

1028
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:57,838
This is traditional one
with my dabber.

1029
00:43:57,905 --> 00:43:59,706
I put all the color.

1030
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:03,143
By the way, four cat there.

1031
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,412
Four cat here, I give you
another idea.

1032
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,647
Interrupt a minute.

1033
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:07,981
When you do the stencil,

1034
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:11,852
when you place my stencil,
look at the whole template.

1035
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:13,620
Don't just look,
use the whole template,

1036
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:14,988
make it one pattern.

1037
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,858
Take different portion
of the design, okay?

1038
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:21,061
Like this cat,
you make a cat like that.

1039
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:24,298
So look at it
over this stencil.

1040
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:25,933
Can you tell?

1041
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,602
And there'll be fur--
It's not here.

1042
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:30,604
My other symbol, anyway.

1043
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,339
Oh, I have--
Here.

1044
00:44:36,276 --> 00:44:38,011
Look at this set.

1045
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:40,380
See the cat
from one cat template.

1046
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,316
But look at color,
look at pattern.

1047
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:43,517
Different--
How?

1048
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,052
The color from inking, right?

1049
00:44:45,118 --> 00:44:46,553
But pattern from what?

1050
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,690
From that stencil
overlayer different stencil.

1051
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:51,959
You do first cat stencil color

1052
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,162
and take second piece,
overlayer, do the color.

1053
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:56,663
So I call overlayer.

1054
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,298
So that's very important.

1055
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,568
Where you place my template,
don't just use one pattern.

1056
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:04,438
You create your own,
either by overlayer

1057
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:07,174
or either by pick up part
of the design.

1058
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:08,575
Create your own pattern.

1059
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:12,646
Okay, so this is
how to use my template, okay.

1060
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,948
Look at these four tree.

1061
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:18,752
Look at the winter tree
on the top right on the top.

1062
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:20,354
This is my winter tree.

1063
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,890
You can see I used stencil.

1064
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:26,460
And you just create like
a winter background.

1065
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:29,429
I use a white
and number 38, a blue.

1066
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:30,797
Create a background.

1067
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,466
And then, that's my tree.

1068
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,769
Unfortunately, because my class,
because of my new technique,

1069
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:37,704
all the tree are totally
sold out.

1070
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:40,240
Even myself don't have
any copy of that.

1071
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:43,710
And that's by collage with
the shaving cream with squeegee.

1072
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:46,680
Okay, so this basic technique.

1073
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,082
See, this is my collage tree.

1074
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:50,851
See the pattern, okay.

1075
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,352
This is my new technique.

1076
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:55,889
And then we move to number 10A
and 10B.

1077
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:58,125
10B is very interesting.

1078
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:01,528
Before, I never color
my stencil.

1079
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:05,399
I always use my stencil, do
the dabbing, you know, dabbing.

1080
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:08,302
And this year,
look at all the sample here.

1081
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:09,603
Is over there, too.

1082
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,004
Look all this sample.

1083
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,574
I never sell this template
before,

1084
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,311
but after this technique come
out, every single of my stencil,

1085
00:46:17,377 --> 00:46:21,648
you do color with Fantastic,
you know, outline with color.

1086
00:46:21,715 --> 00:46:23,150
You create like art piece.

1087
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:25,118
Look at my gecko,
isn't that fun?

1088
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:28,121
So totally change the way
I use my stencil.

1089
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:30,691
Now, you can do dabbing stencil,
right.

1090
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:35,128
And then you can color, use that
piece like your coloring book,

1091
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,064
you color my stencil.

1092
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,969
You can color your fabric
and do trees, use collage.

1093
00:46:42,035 --> 00:46:44,238
And then I outline the edge.

1094
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:47,074
Okay, the new technique
I just show you,

1095
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,377
my patina fabric
with a sea sponge.

1096
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:54,181
10D, new technique,
okay, look at here.

1097
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:56,250
Look at all my jacket.

1098
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,353
This piece very interest.

1099
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:01,555
Look at the first one, left.

1100
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:04,491
That one created
from my every single piece

1101
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:06,059
of my shaving cream.

1102
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:08,662
But we bought the
cheapest muslin from JOANN.

1103
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:13,500
They have 20% discount, so about
a dollar a piece in our yard.

1104
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:16,403
So I make that-- Every single
we do shaving cream.

1105
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,305
If you see my husband demo.

1106
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:22,876
So every single piece later--
the lady make jacket.

1107
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:24,411
See, this from my shaving cream

1108
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:28,248
and from my stencil maple leaf
and flower with my ink.

1109
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:31,218
Creates such a beautiful jacket,
and next one in the middle,

1110
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:32,386
very classic.

1111
00:47:32,452 --> 00:47:33,720
I love classic thing.

1112
00:47:33,787 --> 00:47:36,690
Look at that very classic jacket
with stencil.

1113
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:38,425
Look, my blue jean.

1114
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,127
This not--
This no funky one.

1115
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:41,595
This just okay.

1116
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:44,097
Not very funky for young kids,
okay.

1117
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:45,933
One day, I will wear
the short blue jean,

1118
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:49,503
show you how the funky style
with my head

1119
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,773
or stencil with my inking,
with my template.

1120
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,609
Okay, 10D, I think probably this
is the last one.

1121
00:47:55,676 --> 00:47:58,278
Before I finish,
I have a couple of minutes.

1122
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,514
First, I want you come here.

1123
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:02,916
You can forget what
I present here,

1124
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:06,420
but at least you need to learn
two Japanese word,

1125
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:10,657
because I call this Joyce
Tsukineko world-- word.

1126
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:14,094
Today we come here exploring
the beauty adventure for that.

1127
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:16,096
So everybody follow me.

1128
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,898
We learn two Japanese word.

1129
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:19,633
Tsuki neko.

1130
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:22,936
Okay, Tsuki, like a vegetable,
zucchini.

1131
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,671
Change Z to T.

1132
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,908
Neko, like girl's name Nicole.

1133
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:29,543
Neko, not Nicole.

1134
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,078
You accent-- neko.

1135
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,446
So everybody follow me.

1136
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:34,982
Tsu-ki-ne-ko.
- Audience: Tsu-ki-ne-ko.

1137
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,149
- One more time.

1138
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:37,484
Tsu-ki-ne-ko.
- Audience: Tsu-ki-ne-ko.

1139
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:38,652
- One more time.

1140
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,820
Tsu-ki-ne-ko.
- Audience: Tsu-ki-ne-ko.

1141
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:42,256
Good, you can speak
two Japanese word.

1142
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:44,057
What that means, okay.

1143
00:48:44,124 --> 00:48:45,792
Tsuki means moon.

1144
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:49,596
Tsuki means moon,
neko means cat.

1145
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,098
Cat in the moon.

1146
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:53,767
For the States--
Our country,

1147
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:55,969
we have a cow in the moon.

1148
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,604
My name is Joyce.

1149
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,940
I'm not Japanese, I'm Chinese.

1150
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,442
If you ask me what
tsukineko means,

1151
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:06,847
I say pig in the moon because
I was born the Year of Pig.

1152
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:10,551
So you can make up yourself,
but you be careful.

1153
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:13,620
A lot of Japanese lady
came to Houston

1154
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:16,323
or came to Paducah
for the quilt show.

1155
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,692
They are winner,
beautiful quilt work.

1156
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:20,761
If you have
a real Japanese in front of you,

1157
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:22,963
what tsukineko means?

1158
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,599
What tsukineko means?

1159
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,101
- Audience: Cat.
- Cat in the moon, good.

1160
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:30,003
You are not over 80 year old.

1161
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,639
Two months I was in
New England presentation there.

1162
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:35,709
I asked all the lady,
"Tsuki neko is cat in--

1163
00:49:35,776 --> 00:49:37,144
So happy, cat in the moon."

1164
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,046
Two minutes later,
I say, "What that means?"

1165
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,214
They look at each other.

1166
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,381
"Hey, what that means?"

1167
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:43,116
So that is proof.

1168
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,520
Wisconsin, this show here,

1169
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:48,722
I say it is the most
young generation

1170
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,457
I ever seen for the show.

1171
00:49:50,524 --> 00:49:54,194
So I'm so happy have
presentation here and join me.

1172
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:56,330
And by the way,
I recruit you

1173
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:59,666
because I introduce you
to Joyce Tsukineko Lane.

1174
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,768
So you contribute yourself.

1175
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:04,338
If you have any quilt thing,
anything you want,

1176
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:06,173
make a thing, share with me.

1177
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,409
I really want all-- I wish
all the quilter on the floor

1178
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,278
can have one of my kit.

1179
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,713
Okay, by the way,

1180
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:17,251
appreciate your patience here
to listen my hour presentation.

1181
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:20,220
I have a little free gift
share with you.

1182
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:24,691
My booth is booth 100 and
definitely see my husband demo.

1183
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:27,761
Okay, here's a demo
for the shaving cream.

1184
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:30,030
Oh, by the way,
I still have one minute.

1185
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:35,402
Okay, I am not the one
inventing shaving cream marble.

1186
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:38,906
Trish Stuart,
she is from Dallas area.

1187
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:40,073
She invented.

1188
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,009
I met her about 11 years ago

1189
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:44,311
in Chicago International
Quilt Show.

1190
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:46,480
When she played that project
in her booth,

1191
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,416
I walked by, I said,
"Trish, who will play that,

1192
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:51,185
a messy project?"

1193
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:54,221
I walked by
without any minutes' attention.

1194
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:55,722
But you never know.

1195
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:59,059
Ten year later,
I'm queen of shaving cream.

1196
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:01,929
[audience laughs]
'Til today, 'til today,

1197
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:05,732
I'm still playing with amazing
Barbasol shaving cream.

1198
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:07,334
By the way, get Barbasol.

1199
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,403
Don't get any dollar store
cheaper brand.

1200
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:10,637
It's flat, okay.

1201
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:12,239
So you just--

1202
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:14,775
So I think--
Any question?

1203
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:16,610
Yes.

1204
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:18,212
- Attendee 2: I'm still not
quite clear

1205
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:20,581
how you use
the shaving cream.

1206
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:24,151
- Okay, so shaving, I told you
this presentation here

1207
00:51:24,218 --> 00:51:26,520
give you the idea,
the technique part.

1208
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:28,222
Please go to my booth.

1209
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:30,557
Especially you never see
any shaving cream,

1210
00:51:30,624 --> 00:51:32,159
ever heard anything about it.

1211
00:51:32,226 --> 00:51:33,460
Go to my booth.

1212
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:36,930
You will understand what
amazing shaving cream can do.

1213
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:39,933
My husband will demo show you
the marble pattern

1214
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,236
and the leftover shaving cream
so you have an ink.

1215
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:43,403
Don't throw it away.

1216
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,272
Still use second part.

1217
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:48,976
Your squeegee pick up and you
can create tie-dye pattern.

1218
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,477
Okay, and the last part,

1219
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:53,347
still use leftover shaving cream
with the ink over there.

1220
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,616
Create a whole
background fabric color.

1221
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:58,819
So go to my booth,
take a look at the real sample.

1222
00:51:58,886 --> 00:52:01,021
I will say thank you to Tina.

1223
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:03,624
Thank you for Lynn
for all the--

1224
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,959
You know, Zack and Tommy
helped make this one.

1225
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:07,828
And I will say thank you
to my friend,

1226
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,898
make all my video,
and thank you all my student.

1227
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,065
Look at-- Marilyn's here.

1228
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,233
Stand up.

1229
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,402
She used shaving cream,
create her T-shirt.

1230
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,404
I say I don't know if she
will wear T-shirt.

1231
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,807
I will otherwise ask her to make
a lighter color, see?

1232
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:22,309
- Marilyn: I had to do it.

1233
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:24,278
- 'Cause she's from Missouri,
yeah.

1234
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,480
- And do three at a time.

1235
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,915
- Do three at a time?

1236
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,417
Great.
- Lay 'em down after--

1237
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:32,052
- Yeah, we have a technique.

1238
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:34,321
By the way, I have
book available, too.

1239
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:35,722
Okay, thank you.

1240
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:38,792
Okay, let me mention
the tool, the medium, water.

1241
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:42,696
Right, like watercolor and the
shaving cream and the alcohol.

1242
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:45,532
By the way, 404, why I use 404.

1243
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,534
We have-- When we work
with the kids, right,

1244
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:49,269
with special kid.

1245
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:52,573
So use-- You have a lot
of intricate designs

1246
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,042
for your pattern
or you work with a kid.

1247
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:58,178
So when we do dabbing
before 2014,

1248
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:00,113
I always big challenge.

1249
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,616
When we do stencil
on the fabric,

1250
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:05,419
bleeding, running, right?

1251
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:08,155
Because this liquid--
water-based liquid ink.

1252
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:12,693
So now, we use--
I suggest use this adhesive 404.

1253
00:53:15,162 --> 00:53:17,631
This is adhesive, not 505.

1254
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:22,669
This will adhesive from
plastic stencil to your fabric.

1255
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,705
I will use this for my class,
okay.

1256
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:26,707
I will spray it on the back
of your template.

1257
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:30,577
One spray, you can repeat it,
use about over 10 times.

1258
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:32,579
Don't wash away right away,
okay?

1259
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,114
You will use for 10 times.

1260
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:35,983
So this 404.

1261
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,285
This not media,
but it saves you.

1262
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:40,921
Okay, aloe vera gel, okay.

1263
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:45,459
Aloe, before 2014, I just
told you we have big challenge,

1264
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,995
how to prevent bleeding
on the fabric, right?

1265
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:50,130
At that time,
we have no other choice.

1266
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:53,333
We use a clear aloe vera gel,
okay?

1267
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:57,905
Before I use
my dabber, pick out ink,

1268
00:53:57,971 --> 00:54:01,074
I use little-- pick out
a little bit of clear aloe

1269
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:02,242
and then do stencil.

1270
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:05,979
But after 2014 November,
I have another

1271
00:54:06,046 --> 00:54:08,215
wonderful tip share with you,
okay?

1272
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:10,317
When you use dabber,
you do stencil,

1273
00:54:10,384 --> 00:54:12,119
before you pick up ink,

1274
00:54:12,186 --> 00:54:17,024
please pick up clean,
clean shaving cream, okay?

1275
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,394
Pick up clean shaving cream
and then dab-dab it, smooth it,

1276
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,229
get rid of excess shaving cream.

1277
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:24,665
From here, pick up your ink.

1278
00:54:24,731 --> 00:54:27,000
Still dab, dab,
cover the whole dabber.

1279
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:30,871
So the shaving cream
will act as a carrier.

1280
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:34,708
Let your printing job smooth,
easy, and pretty.

1281
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Okay, not the runny.

1282
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,112
Another tip, I don't know
how much time I have.

1283
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:42,716
When I work on my studio,
I go to dollar store,

1284
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:45,018
buy the big poster board

1285
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,789
and go to OfficeMax,
laminate it.

1286
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:51,225
So after you laminate
your poster board,

1287
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,227
that will be
like your art palette.

1288
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:57,798
Be this coating like, you know,
same theory like a thermometer.

1289
00:54:57,865 --> 00:54:59,433
The mercury, right?

1290
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:02,603
Mercury always come out
the whole drop, no spread out.

1291
00:55:02,669 --> 00:55:03,971
The same theory.

1292
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:06,540
So you drop an ink
on that laminate board,

1293
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:08,876
will be totally one
or not spread out,

1294
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:10,777
not bleed, runny, okay.

1295
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:13,113
And always,
when you play any of my project,

1296
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,518
always put a piece of white
napkin or baby wiper

1297
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,620
or spray Windex.

1298
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:22,556
By the way, 91% rubbing alcohol

1299
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,158
is a very good
cleaning agent for ink.

1300
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:28,262
So put aside where you do
dabbing, do any project,

1301
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:31,431
dab, dab, clean,
and go to dry piece of napkin.

1302
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,867
Dry, dry, and then use
next color.

1303
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,702
Okay, thank you so much.

1304
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,705
Thank you for your coming
and sharing this.

1305
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:40,274
Thank you.
