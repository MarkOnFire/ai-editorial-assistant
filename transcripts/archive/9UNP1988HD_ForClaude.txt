00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,036
[gentle music]

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,272
- Allen Pyle: Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,874
It is a real pleasure
to be here.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,977
I am always happy
to talk about plants

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,112
and kind of the subtitle,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,214
or the real title
of this plant talk

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,383
is "I get paid to go
to trial gardens

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,151
"and take pictures
of cool stuff,

9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,953
and now I get to share it
with you,"

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,823
so I'm really happy to do that.

11
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,426
Professional plant trials
are a little different

12
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,395
than some of the gardens
that you see.

13
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,431
We have a number of
really wonderful botanic gardens

14
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,799
and public gardens in the state,

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,202
and I really encourage you
to get out to see what's growing

16
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,805
and see how people are using
plants in those situations.

17
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,309
Typically, professional
plant trials include varieties

18
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,011
that are not on the market yet,

19
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,812
so that the professional
industry can take a look

20
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,281
a year early and say,

21
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,350
"Ooh, we need to add that
to our program."

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,954
So that is a real advantage
on the professional side.

23
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:58,425
Now, just because something's
new on the market doesn't mean,

24
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:02,563
"A," that it is going to be
attractive to you personally.

25
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,132
"B," that it is going to
be really needed on the market

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,401
and different
from other varieties

27
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,636
and, you know, a good variety.

28
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,471
And sometimes
new varieties are designed

29
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,440
to be helpful
to the production side

30
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,509
of professional horticulture.

31
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,679
So they're easier to produce,
shorter production window.

32
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,582
So they're more economical
for the professional side

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,551
even though they might
not look super different.

34
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,522
So with that said,
we're gonna proceed on.

35
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,326
These are the variety trials
that I got to check out

36
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,662
in both Wisconsin
and in Michigan.

37
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,665
Michigan has a coordinated
garden plant tour

38
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,834
of professional
propagation nurseries,

39
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,570
one of which I used to work at,
C. Raker & Sons,

40
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,606
which was that overhead picture
you saw at the beginning.

41
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,842
They've got about seven acres
of trial gardens now.

42
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,646
So we're gonna start off with
one of my favorite classes,

43
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,381
edible plants.

44
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,118
New for 2025,
Basil Everleaf Lemon.

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,321
This is what's called
a columnar basil.

46
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,056
It grows upright.

47
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,393
And the advantage
of columnar basils

48
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,561
is they're great to harvest.

49
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,030
You can cut 'em off
four inches up.

50
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,432
So you have sprouts,
new sprouts can come out.

51
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,168
And then you just strip
the leaves off.

52
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,869
It's not all this branch stuff

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,671
where you're trying
to use one of the cutters

54
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,606
and end up with stem bits.

55
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,774
The other thing,

56
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,344
the Everleaf varieties
have delayed flowering.

57
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,346
So you're gonna get
a longer harvest window

58
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,616
'cause typically
once basil goes to bud,

59
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,585
the culinary value goes down.

60
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,420
So there are three
other varieties in the series

61
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,256
Everleaf Genovese,
Everleaf Thai Towers,

62
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,792
which is a Thai basil with
kind of that licorice flavor,

63
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,395
and Everleaf Emerald Towers.

64
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,896
Really good varieties.

65
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,567
Normally, columnar basils were
only vegetatively propagated,

66
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,768
so you did 'em from cuttings.

67
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,102
These are all from seed.

68
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,871
These will be widely available.

69
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:54,508
And Everleaf Lemon did get
the Green Thumb Award

70
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:59,079
from the National Garden Bureau
this year for 2025.

71
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,948
Okay, hot peppers.

72
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,419
Habaneros typically
are really hot.

73
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,154
Too hot for most people.

74
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,390
This is an F1 hybrid,
early productive variety

75
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,059
that's lower in heat.

76
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,029
It's only about a third of the
heat of a typical habanero.

77
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,667
So it's like 70,000 Scoville
instead of 300,000.

78
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,337
So if you are not

79
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,005
a super hot-head,
this is a great variety.

80
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:29,076
I personally have picked
100 ripe peppers off one plant

81
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,144
in one big pot of this variety.

82
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,746
It's a great variety.

83
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,982
Most habaneros,
the OP varieties,

84
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,117
mature late in the season here,

85
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,319
and this one will mature
earlier.

86
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,890
It's a great variety,
highly, highly recommend it.

87
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,658
Another habanero.

88
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,393
I am a hot-head

89
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,129
in terms of what I like to eat,
spice-wise.

90
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,331
This is a heatless variety.

91
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,867
You can literally eat this
off the plant,

92
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,803
and you can experience
the really interesting citrusy,

93
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,839
sweet flavors of a habanero

94
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:03,443
that are normally masked by
a lot of capsaicin spice heat.

95
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,481
It is an F1 hybrid,
it's reasonably early.

96
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,851
This was a 2018
All-America Selections winner.

97
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,153
So it is gonna be
pretty widely available.

98
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,821
And this one was bred
by a company

99
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,490
that used to be called Seminis,

100
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:20,661
and now it is
under the Vegetables by Bayer.

101
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,163
Americans call it Bay-er,
Germans call it Bai-er.

102
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,265
Okay, so another good habanero.

103
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,669
Tomatoes, most popular
garden vegetable.

104
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,105
Normally we think
determinate, shorter ones.

105
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,141
Indeterminate, taller ones.

106
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,876
Micro-dwarf.

107
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,312
Interesting, huh?

108
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,380
These normally get to be
8 to 12 inches,

109
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,682
depending on the variety.

110
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,951
This particular one is
about 10 to 12 inches.

111
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,620
Small cherry fruit,
great for window boxes,

112
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,622
and it is an F1 hybrid,

113
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,192
so it is vigorous and productive
and really, really good

114
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,261
if you've got
a limited, small space.

115
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,896
And it's also pretty early.

116
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,798
A lot of times,
tomato varieties will say,

117
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,033
"Well, it's 70 days
from transplant,"

118
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,169
and your transplant is
four to six weeks old.

119
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,439
This is 70 days from sowing,
so it's pretty quick.

120
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,041
And this is a very small
window box on my patio.

121
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,477
So highly recommended,
PanAmerican Seed.

122
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,679
You'll hear that name again.

123
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,214
Okay.

124
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:18,619
If anyone has brought anything
to throw or wants to storm out

125
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,088
when I mention a
genetically-modified variety,

126
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,389
now is your chance.

127
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,592
But give me a second first,
please.

128
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,827
The Purple Tomato.

129
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,364
This is UK breeding
from Norfolk Healthy Produce.

130
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,599
It is an
indeterminate cherry tomato,

131
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,002
70 days from transplant.

132
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,939
It's got a gene from snapdragon

133
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,509
that is used
as basically a volume knob.

134
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,612
We call it a transcription
factor in science,

135
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,914
but it's a volume knob.

136
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,218
It turns up to 11 the purple
that's already in tomato,

137
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,854
so that you can have purple
all the way through.

138
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,790
Previously, it was
only the skin in sunlight

139
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,327
that would develop
that purple color.

140
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,762
This is an interesting variety.

141
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,898
You can buy it online
from Norfolk Healthy Produce.

142
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,834
It's 20 bucks for a packet.

143
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,102
It's been very expensive
for them to develop

144
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,437
and they need to recoup.

145
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,774
It is starting to show up
in markets,

146
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,678
and different greenhouses
will hopefully have it for sale

147
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,080
in 2025 at a premium price

148
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,516
because they need to recoup
their investment.

149
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,653
So, the fruit is solid purple
all the way throughout.

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,425
It's very sweet, it's delicious,
it dehydrates well.

151
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,628
The purple color
is high in antioxidants.

152
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,730
It's also got
an extended shelf life.

153
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,365
So after you harvest it,

154
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,033
the fruit lasts
for a pretty good time.

155
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,837
It's just a natural thing
not related to the GMO.

156
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,206
The breeder is working
on expanding the line,

157
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,908
adding disease resistance,

158
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,211
and I'm really excited to see
what happens with this one.

159
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:55,415
So not all GMOs
are throwing-things worthy,

160
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,718
which is good to know.

161
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,886
All right, perennials.

162
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,053
Let's talk about perennials.

163
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,788
My favorite.

164
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,158
Buddleias,
compact Buddleias.

165
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,229
This is a new class of Buddleia.

166
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,933
Typically, Buddleias are
herbaceous to woody,

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,070
and they will normally get,
you know, four to six feet.

168
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,139
Depending on
how severe the winter is,

169
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,342
they may die back to the ground
or die back partially.

170
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,012
These guys are short,
they're like two feet.

171
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,747
They're zone 5a.

172
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,249
Potentially good in containers.

173
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,919
Is this something
the market needs?

174
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,787
I don't know.

175
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,956
Especially if you're
growing these in containers

176
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,224
in Wisconsin,

177
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,861
you probably best thinking
of them as a woody annual

178
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,596
and not a perennial.

179
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,598
So there's other series
out there.

180
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,802
The Little Rockstars
is from D?mmen Orange.

181
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,205
This one,

182
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,575
the flowers are a little
stubby compared to a Buddleia.

183
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,844
There are varieties typically
that have kind of a curving,

184
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,812
almost gooseneck-like flower.

185
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,049
I don't particularly like
the stubby flowers, personally,

186
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,650
but you may.

187
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,953
All of these are
very fragrant as well.

188
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,287
So if you're into fragrance.

189
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,922
And there's other colors
in the series.

190
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,927
Another National Garden Bureau
Green Thumb Award.

191
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,762
Digitalis.

192
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,399
So the foxgloves,
the commonly grown foxglove

193
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,901
is a biennial big flower.

194
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,803
So it grows as a rosette
one year

195
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,372
and then flowers the next year
and dies.

196
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,376
These are hardy perennials,
5a, zone 5a.

197
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,711
18 to 24 inches.

198
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,246
And they're
interspecific hybrids

199
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,315
between <i>Digitalis purpurea,</i>
the one I just mentioned,

200
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:40,020
and the strawberry foxglove,
<i>Digitalis mertonensis.</i>

201
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,188
Neat plants.

202
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:45,158
Do note, all parts
of <i>Digitalis</i> are toxic.

203
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,362
They're a source
of some interesting heart drugs.

204
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,098
But you need to do science
to work with that.

205
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,966
So, not for eating.

206
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,770
And there's
a companion variety.

207
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,705
Lemon Cream Arctic Fox.

208
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,308
Very similar characteristics.

209
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,310
It's a different
interspecific hybrid.

210
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,813
This is <i>Digitalis purpurea</i>
times <i>Digitalis grandiflora.</i>

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,715
I like <i>Digitalis grandiflora</i>
alone.

212
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,985
It's a little bit
more yellow flower color

213
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,955
and about the same height,
sometimes a little shorter.

214
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,723
Again poisonous,
so be cautious

215
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,959
if you've got kids
or pets or whatever.

216
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,360
Echinacea.

217
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,129
This is Kieft Seed Breeding,

218
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,464
which is one of the
Ball Horticultural

219
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,866
umbrella companies.

220
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,234
Zone 4 hardy.

221
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,636
This guy is fairly compact,

222
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:33,507
like two to three feet,
by up to about two feet wide.

223
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,242
This is from seed.

224
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:40,714
So historically, most
of the extra colorful Echinaceas

225
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,116
which are interspecific hybrids,

226
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,118
are from vegetative propagation
only.

227
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,787
So they don't come true
from seed.

228
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:49,423
There are a few mixed color
varieties out there from seed,

229
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,327
but this is the first series
that is a F1 hybrid

230
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,128
and it has individual colors.

231
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,164
So this is a real breakthrough.

232
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,433
Floriferous, drought tolerant.

233
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,602
Pollinators will be happy
if you plant it.

234
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,670
There's also a yellow.

235
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,405
Yellow Ombre.

236
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,175
Similar characteristics.

237
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:12,513
This guy was a 2023 Regional
All-America Selections winner

238
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,681
in the southeast
and the northwest.

239
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:15,849
Good varieties.

240
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,084
These should be
widely available.

241
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,752
They are significantly easier

242
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,320
for the wholesale growers
to produce

243
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,822
because they can do them
from seed

244
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,825
instead of having to get in
tissue culture plantlets,

245
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:29,563
which is a very high-tech
process of propagation.

246
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,866
But these guys are from seed.

247
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:37,371
Another echinacea,
the Sombrero series from Darwin.

248
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,875
These are not quite zoned 4a,
better in zone 4b.

249
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,911
Orange flowers
with an orange cone.

250
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,412
Kind of a nice color.

251
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,815
About 20 inches tall
by 24 inches wide.

252
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,218
And they are a little bit
compact.

253
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,021
Again, a good pollinator plant,
drought tolerant,

254
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,089
really nice variety.

255
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,560
Danziger,
an Israeli breeding company.

256
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:03,230
We call it Dan-ziger over here.
[audience laughing]

257
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,299
Has a series called Panama.

258
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,334
And this is Panama Rose.

259
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,535
There's also a red.

260
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,371
Very compact, 12 inches tall.

261
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,806
Zone 5a.

262
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,575
This is cutting propagated.

263
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,110
And Danziger has cutting farms

264
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,713
throughout different parts
of the world,

265
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,448
where they grow stock plants

266
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,651
and then ship the growers
unrooted cuttings.

267
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,254
Really cool variety,
nice, compact.

268
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,223
Good in a container.

269
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,526
<i>Phlox paniculata</i> Jeana.

270
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,230
This is a zone 3 hardy phlox.

271
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,266
It is taller, like,
four to five feet.

272
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:43,136
Unlike most garden phlox,
it's got small flowers.

273
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,507
In these clusters, the
individual flowers are small.

274
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,642
Kind of a lavender pink color.

275
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,712
This has good
powdery mildew resistance,

276
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,681
which is a common problem
on the garden phloxes.

277
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,051
And this is highly, highly
attractive to butterflies.

278
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,521
In the Mt. Cuba Center trials,

279
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,856
where they're now looking
at pollinator attractiveness

280
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,092
of the different varieties
they trial.

281
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,862
This was the most attractive
garden phlox in the trials.

282
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:14,201
So, it is a Perennial Plant
Association Plant of the Year

283
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,836
for 2024.

284
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,540
So this is one that you should
see available on the market.

285
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,677
And it's a good variety if you
have the space for a tall one.

286
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,512
<i>Pycnanthemum.</i>

287
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,551
<i>Pycnanthemum muticum</i> is the 2025
Perennial Plant of the Year.

288
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,886
It's a native--
it is not a Wisconsin native.

289
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,155
It's a fantastic
pollinator plant.

290
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,492
All the <i>Pycnanthemum</i> are,
I highly, highly recommend them.

291
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,627
They are a mint family plant,

292
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,963
but they're not an aggressive,
spreading mint.

293
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,433
They're clumping, so they're not
gonna take over the world.

294
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,369
This one is also,
you can grow it from seed,

295
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,605
and it will flower
the first year from seed.

296
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,074
The seed doesn't need you to
jump through all kinds of hoops

297
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,276
and do stratification
and scarification.

298
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,011
It's easy to do,

299
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,480
as is the other <i>Pycnanthemum</i>
that I've done,

300
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:05,185
<i>Pycnanthemum virginicum,</i>
which is a Wisconsin native.

301
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,353
Okay.

302
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,355
This is the last perennial.

303
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,425
<i>Rudbeckia,</i> which is one
of my favorite genera.

304
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,595
This is a variety called
American Gold Rush,

305
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:18,031
and this was the 2023
Perennial Plant Association

306
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,766
Plant of the Year.

307
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,237
It was developed to be resistant
to a leaf spot disease

308
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,240
that <i>Rudbeckia</i> Goldsturm
commonly gets.

309
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,042
<i>Rudbeckia</i> Goldsturm
has probably been overplanted,

310
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,613
which is why it so commonly
has septoria leaf spot,

311
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,281
which doesn't really hurt
the plant,

312
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:35,983
it just makes
the leaves look ugly.

313
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,051
This is a compact habit
about 22 inches,

314
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,488
it's vegetative, and it's
also an interspecific hybrid.

315
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,156
So it's got
a little bit narrower,

316
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,059
fuzzier leaves than a typical
orange coneflower,

317
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,328
which is wider
and more dark colored.

318
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,197
All right.

319
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,266
Deep breath, annuals.

320
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,803
Once upon a time,
I was just a perennial guy,

321
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,873
and now I have to learn
about other stuff.

322
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,742
But I have learned
to embrace petunias.

323
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,678
There's a lot of petunias
coming up.

324
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:08,315
So that said,
Ageratum MONARCH MAGIC.

325
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,852
It's not just a marketing name.

326
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,054
The first time I saw
this plant in a trial garden,

327
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,123
look what I had,
a monarch hanging out on it.

328
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,091
They really do like this.

329
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,128
I think they have an affinity
for this color purple,

330
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,864
because a lot of the <i>Liatris</i>
that they really love

331
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,699
are very similar.

332
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,069
So this is
a more compact variety,

333
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:33,273
up to a foot tall and
almost a foot and a half wide.

334
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,943
Good in containers and baskets,

335
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,379
and it also does well
in the landscape.

336
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,349
Highly attractive
to butterflies.

337
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,218
And this is
Ball Flora plant breeding.

338
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,486
So it's a sister company
of PanAm,

339
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,888
but it's the vegetative side.

340
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:50,524
So this is a vegetative variety.

341
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,626
Okay, <i>Calibrachoas.</i>

342
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,696
So once upon a time in the '90s,

343
00:14:55,762 --> 00:15:00,033
this weird little small-flowered
petunia relative came to market.

344
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,235
And it was kind of cool,

345
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,836
but they were kind of hard
to grow,

346
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,238
and they were prone
to getting chlorotic

347
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,573
because they like
acidic soil conditions,

348
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,576
and they're kind of finicky,
and I was not very sold on them.

349
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:13,213
But now, the breeders have
worked on these quite a bit.

350
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,582
And they are good plants.

351
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,020
They've adjusted their tolerance
to suboptimal conditions

352
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,789
so that they are much,
much easier to grow.

353
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,592
Now, why would you want a
small-flowered petunia relative?

354
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:29,429
Because the color range
is much bigger.

355
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,633
This is a series called
Caliloco.

356
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,302
Crazy <i>calibrachoas.</i>

357
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,604
From Westhoff,
which is a German breeder,

358
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,842
and they have kind of carved
a niche for themselves

359
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,144
in doing some unusual
funky colors,

360
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,847
both in petunias,
which you'll see coming up

361
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,582
and in the <i>calibrachoas.</i>

362
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,651
So this series is new.

363
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,653
It was new last year,

364
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,756
and this is one
of the more compact,

365
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,225
kind of spreading
trailing varieties.

366
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,428
So it's good in hanging baskets,
mixed containers.

367
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:04,131
It can be your spiller
and, you know,

368
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,333
some pretty unusual colors
compared to what

369
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,236
you typically see
in a petunia.

370
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,238
They also have Frankenberry,

371
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,474
which, if you used to be a kid
that loved sugary cereal,

372
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,076
you should appreciate.

373
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,713
Similar habit
in terms of size and use.

374
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:25,485
LIA Abstract Lemon Cherry
from Danziger.

375
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,955
Another National Garden Bureau

376
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,591
Green Thumb Award winner
for 2025.

377
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,292
There's 14 colors in the series.

378
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,229
Not all of them
have this cool bicolor.

379
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,830
But this is really
an interesting one.

380
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,632
It's got kind of
an irregular pattern,

381
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,702
about 12 to 14 inches tall,
kind of semi-trailing.

382
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,605
So it's mounds,
but it spills over.

383
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,375
This one was a top-10 pick
in Plantpeddler Trials.

384
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,910
That's a propagator in Iowa

385
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,845
that I did not get to visit
this year,

386
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,848
but I'm hoping I'll get
there next year.

387
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,850
All right, MiniFamous.

388
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:02,923
Now, all these capitalized words
with the trademark symbol

389
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,727
sometimes gets more confusing
than helpful to the consumer.

390
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,263
So this is MiniFamous Uno,

391
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,634
which is contrasted
with MiniFamous Neo

392
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:18,438
and also contrasted
with MiniFamous Evo.

393
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,507
[audience laughing]

394
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,409
The Evos are all
double-flowered.

395
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:23,577
That's easy.

396
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,212
You can tell by seeing.

397
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,615
The other ones,
it's habit differences.

398
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,617
And breeders have
this marketing name.

399
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,019
They're trying to get traction.

400
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,188
They're trying to get traction
down at the consumer level,

401
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,355
thanks to the wave petunias.

402
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,025
The wave petunias
started it all

403
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,593
in terms of marketing.

404
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,728
Okay, so this is
a MiniFamous Uno.

405
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:47,000
It's compact, 8 to 10 inches
by about 10 to 12 inches.

406
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,069
It's a double flower.

407
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,806
It's, if you like that.
[audience laughing]

408
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:56,510
I don't particularly like double
flowers in <i>calibrachoa</i> much,

409
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,712
but you do sometimes get
some interesting color effects,

410
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,781
like this one has the bicolor.

411
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,184
Okay, <i>Catharanthus,</i>
annual vinca.

412
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:09,089
This is one
that is more popular south.

413
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,491
But as we are getting
to experience

414
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,327
lovely 90-plus-degree summers,

415
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,362
it should be on your list
to think about.

416
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,499
These are very heat
and drought tolerant.

417
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:24,438
This particular variety,
Nirvana XDR Blackberry.

418
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:28,408
XDR stands for
extreme disease resistance

419
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,812
because there's a disease
called aerial <i>Phytophthora,</i>

420
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,481
which is a big problem
in some parts of the world.

421
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,550
We don't have it yet.

422
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,285
Yet.

423
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,387
As we are warming

424
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,022
and our average temperature
is going up,

425
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,291
we are going to be getting
to experience some

426
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,693
of these diseases that
historically,

427
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,497
40 below keeping out the
riffraff has kept out.

428
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:51,665
But that is changing.

429
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:54,201
So the Nirvana XDR series,

430
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,304
well-branched floriferous,
nice bicolor

431
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,339
with a really nice purple,

432
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,742
typically about 14
to 18 inches tall

433
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,544
and a foot or so wide.

434
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,947
There are some other colors
that are pretty nice.

435
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:10,717
We've got Cranberry Halo
and Blue Halo.

436
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:13,220
Again, these are something
to keep in mind

437
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,088
as you look for plants

438
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,991
that are gonna be
more adapted to the hot,

439
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:21,728
dry conditions that we are
experiencing more frequently.

440
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,530
Okay.

441
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,233
And this is all vegetative
material propagated by cuttings.

442
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,203
So let's jump to a seed variety.

443
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,805
This is a nice red.

444
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:36,243
There used to be a series called
Titan from PanAmerican Seed.

445
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,981
Apparently, this is called
Titan-ium Really Red.

446
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:45,719
I refuse to call it titanium
if you put a hyphen in there.

447
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,120
This is from seed.

448
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,791
So it's got
that <i>Phytophthora</i> resistance,

449
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,794
but it's going to be
more widely available and easier

450
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,030
for you to get access to
because you can do it from seed.

451
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,765
There's seven total colors.

452
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,634
This is brand-new for this year.

453
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,004
It's about 14 to 16 inches
and 10 to 12 inches wide.

454
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,739
Cool.

455
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:10,544
Probably not historically on
the radar of Wisconsin growers,

456
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:11,879
but definitely should be.

457
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,180
Great for hot, dry sites.

458
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,983
Good in containers,
baskets, in the garden.

459
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,187
Okay, Dahlia
Black Forest Ruby from Takii,

460
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,289
which is a Japanese breeder.

461
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,891
I know their American seed rep,

462
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,692
and I've known him
for a long, long time.

463
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,860
Good guy.

464
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,028
This is the first

465
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:31,231
seed-propagated purple leaf
variety, okay?

466
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,800
Historically,
the purple-leaf types

467
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,103
were always propagated
vegetatively.

468
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,338
So this is a big,
big breakthrough.

469
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:42,709
And it got an All-America
Selections award for 2025.

470
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:45,546
One of the nice things about the
All-America Selections awards

471
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,650
is to get the award given to you
for your variety,

472
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,652
you have to have
enough propagation material,

473
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,221
whether it's seed or cuttings
or tissue culture,

474
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,590
to actually supply
the market well

475
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,292
so that gardeners
can actually get it

476
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,027
and won't be disappointed
looking for it.

477
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,397
So it's a good program,
this is a good variety.

478
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,666
Definitely should be
on your radar.

479
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:10,304
About 20 to 28 inches tall
and 10 to 14 inches wide.

480
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:12,706
Okay, sunflowers.

481
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,709
This little guy,
Sunfinity Double Yellow,

482
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,780
has been the star of a number
of professional trials.

483
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:22,049
It was a top pick
by the professionals

484
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,952
out at the California Spring
Trials last year.

485
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,653
It has been highly rated

486
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,488
in basically every trial
it's been in.

487
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,325
It's vegetative variety,
it's powdery mildew resistant.

488
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,628
It's a little bit taller,
3.5 feet,

489
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:36,864
and it's got
these double blooms.

490
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,665
It's long, blooms all season.

491
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:42,503
It's pretty cool, but it's
a sunflower, you know.

492
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,937
I was kind of surprised
that everybody

493
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,407
was so excited about it,
but, you know, there you go.

494
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,010
There's other vegetative types,
and typically sunflowers,

495
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,411
you know, you can do from seed.

496
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,280
They're super easy,
these are vegetative.

497
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,116
So they're gonna be
potentially more premium price.

498
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:59,486
This guy is from Danziger,
Sol Seeker Golden Nectar

499
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,355
with a nice bicolor flower.

500
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,924
Unlike the last one
that has a fully double flower,

501
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,893
this will be attractive
to pollinators.

502
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,463
You can hopefully see the
little pollinator up on the top.

503
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,697
Bicolor.

504
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,966
I like bicolor flowers
in the garden a lot.

505
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,401
24 to 36 inches tall.

506
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:19,373
And there's three other colors
in the series as well.

507
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,774
All right.

508
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,277
<i>Osteospermum</i> has come
a long way,

509
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,279
like calibrachoas.

510
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,848
This is the 4D series, Blue Ice.

511
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:31,151
It's got kind of
a double, doubled center,

512
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:33,820
which, you know, you like
or you don't.

513
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:37,457
These historically were
very much cool-season plants.

514
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,726
They hated hot summers
and they would die out.

515
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,929
But breeders have
really improved that

516
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:43,797
so that these can perform well

517
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,166
from a spring planting
throughout the season.

518
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,302
But it does prefer
cool temperatures,

519
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,971
so it is something that
you can get out a little earlier

520
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,673
and enjoy a little earlier
in the season.

521
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,408
There's seven other colors,

522
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,143
solids and bicolors
in the series.

523
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,145
This is from Selecta.

524
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,880
And next up...

525
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,050
Petchoa.

526
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,519
Petchoa,
what the heck is that?

527
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:10,057
Well, it's a hybrid
of petunia and <i>calibrachoa.</i>

528
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,226
Who knew?

529
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,528
Historically,

530
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:18,165
this has been a vegetative
series, a vegetative crop.

531
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,933
So you do the cross,

532
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,201
you grow
out the individual seedlings,

533
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,769
you go, "That one's cool,"

534
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,371
and you put it
into a tissue-culture lab,

535
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:26,974
or create stock plants
and take cuttings.

536
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,242
This is from seed.

537
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,643
This is the first one from seed.

538
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,145
And again, it's
a PanAmerican variety,

539
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,815
which is a really good breeder

540
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:38,952
that does a lot of work
bringing things into seed form

541
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,256
from vegetative
so that it's easier to grow

542
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:45,325
for the commercial growers
as well as the home gardeners.

543
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:48,161
So this is a compact one
in terms of height,

544
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:52,566
but it does spread, so great
for baskets, ground covers.

545
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,835
And this received
an industry publication,

546
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,303
<i>Greenhouse Grower</i> magazine

547
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,040
Medal of Excellence Industry
Choice Award in '23.

548
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,410
It is a real breakthrough,
and it does make

549
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:07,581
this particular crop, the
Petchoas, much more available.

550
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,217
But we also have
some vegetative types.

551
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,053
Sakata,
another Japanese breeder.

552
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,455
SuperCal Shocking Pink.

553
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:21,361
Trailing, a little bit taller
in the terms of,

554
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,699
you know, two feet or so,
but spreading habit, trailing.

555
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:28,235
This was voted number two

556
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,338
at the Commercial Growers
of Wisconsin Trial Garden,

557
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:35,909
which is at the Verona
research facility that UW runs.

558
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,312
Now, this is new for 2025,

559
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:43,016
so you should probably be
seeing this one on the market.

560
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,619
And because the Commercial
Growers of Wisconsin

561
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,487
sponsor these trials,

562
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,556
the growers that are involved
with those trials

563
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:52,292
then will offer these varieties
and market them.

564
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,495
So that should be something
that you have

565
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:56,663
pretty good access to.

566
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,799
There's also a Royal Red
in this series,

567
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:02,936
very similar, kind of a nice red
with a dark throat.

568
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,138
Okay, here we go
with the marketing again.

569
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,007
SuperCal Premium.

570
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:09,610
Well, why is it premium?

571
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,411
Well, the flowers are
a little larger.

572
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:14,581
The habit is more mounding
than trailing.

573
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:17,351
There's about 13 colors
in the series.

574
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:20,053
It's about 14 to 20 inches tall
and wide.

575
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,022
Some interesting colors.

576
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,858
You get a petunia-sized flower,

577
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,693
a larger flower
than a <i>calibrachoa</i> with some

578
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,363
of the color range
of the <i>calibrachoas.</i>

579
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:31,999
But even within the series,

580
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:35,769
there can be some variances
in how vigorous these guys are.

581
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:38,138
This is the same trial garden

582
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,175
that the last two shots
were from, the last three.

583
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:44,311
These particular colors, the
sunset orange, the light yellow,

584
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:49,249
and the French vanilla,
are a little bit less vigorous.

585
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,285
And in this particular
trial garden,

586
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:53,320
they do not baby
these plants at all.

587
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,622
No fertilization,
supplemental irrigation.

588
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,057
Throw 'em out
and let 'em survive.

589
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,725
Kind of like a lot of you guys

590
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,428
probably do at your own homes,
right?

591
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,964
So that's not to say that these
colors are particularly bad,

592
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:07,134
but they may be
better spaced closer together.

593
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:08,535
And this is the kind of thing

594
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:09,703
that industry professionals
learn.

595
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,038
Okay.

596
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:14,174
So remember when I said
you might not like every color

597
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,577
that comes on the market?

598
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,381
I call this a love it
or hate it color.

599
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,183
Some people are, "Ooh."

600
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,219
And I'm going, "Ugh."

601
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,223
AMAZONAS Plum Cockatoo.

602
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,193
It's a unique kind
of ruffled-edged flower

603
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,931
with the tricolor,
attractive tricolor flowers.

604
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,735
[audience laughing]

605
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:44,171
It's unique and different.

606
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,573
This was a National
Garden Bureau People's Choice

607
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,377
Green Thumb Award for last year
when it was introduced.

608
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,112
Danziger Breeding.

609
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,414
You know,
you can probably work with it

610
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,217
in a mixed container
with the right companions.

611
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,387
But, yeah,
this is not one of my favorites.

612
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:03,056
Danziger also has
the CASCADIAS series.

613
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,192
This is Arizona Sky.

614
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,927
New for last year.

615
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,630
Semi-trailing,
about 12 to 14 inches tall

616
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,932
and 14 to 18 inches wide.

617
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,800
Interesting color.

618
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,235
You kind of get that
two-tone effect.

619
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,271
In a lot of newer varieties,

620
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:20,174
you kind of have a change
of color as the flowers age,

621
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,342
which can be interesting.

622
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,079
There's 20 colors
totally in the CASCADIA series.

623
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,583
So we'll show
a couple more of 'em.

624
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,853
Lilac Frost,
this is kind of neat.

625
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,222
Semi-trailing habit,
new for this year.

626
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,824
It's got that full edge
around the flower.

627
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,861
So you really get
a strong bicolor effect,

628
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,729
which is kind of cool

629
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:46,600
in that sort of lilac,
light lavender color.

630
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,937
There's also Fuchsia Gem,
or as they say in Europe,

631
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,707
"Fook-sia Gem,"
which is new for 2025.

632
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,977
Very similar
to the previous one.

633
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,712
Interesting option.

634
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:01,114
Could potentially be good
in combination

635
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,083
with the Lilac Frost.

636
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,254
And then we get back to Westhoff
and their Crazytunias.

637
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:10,791
This has been a mainstay
for them for a while.

638
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:14,127
There's lots of red and blue
and white petunias

639
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,362
and even yellows now.

640
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,764
They're coming up
with some funky stuff.

641
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:20,901
This whole collection,
it's not really a series.

642
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:23,337
It's a collection
of unusual colors and patterns.

643
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:27,441
So just because
Crazytunia Sacred Star grows

644
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,209
a certain habit
doesn't necessarily mean

645
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:31,879
that any other Crazytunia
is gonna grow similarly.

646
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,981
They can be fairly different.

647
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,182
Okay.

648
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:39,253
There's 50 colors
in the Crazytunia collection.

649
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,890
This particular one has
a nice red and white bicolor,

650
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:45,526
a little bit irregular red.

651
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:49,930
And this is more upright
and kind of cool.

652
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:52,699
I'm gonna bang through these
pretty quick.

653
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,434
Frisky Orange.

654
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,471
You know,
you've got very irregular...

655
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,474
Not all the patterns are
quite as well formed

656
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:02,176
as with the previous one.

657
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,510
We've got Terracotta,

658
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:07,447
which has that sort of
pink and yellow,

659
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:10,017
which may or may not be
attractive

660
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,019
to your personal taste.

661
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,689
Again, this is an upright habit,
but more of a mounded habit.

662
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:19,459
We've got Cherries Jubilee,
which has the white tips on red,

663
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:21,361
which is kind of nice.

664
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,765
Then we get into these
cosmic varieties

665
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,968
that have the irregular,
lighter-colored edge,

666
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,170
which are kind of cool.

667
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:34,608
And then we move on
to a Danziger variety

668
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:36,376
called Hippy Chick.

669
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,578
Not sure I like the name.

670
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:40,113
Oops,
Hippy Chick Violet.

671
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,984
Unique color
with that edge of white

672
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:47,788
and kind of a nice shape
with the lobed flowers.

673
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:50,724
If you saw this, you might
not think it was a petunia

674
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:51,892
initially.

675
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,093
So kind of cool.

676
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,294
It's a vigorous one.

677
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,562
It is spreading.

678
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,498
Gets to be about two feet wide,
about a foot tall.

679
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,501
Okay, so we talked
about <i>calibrachoa.</i>

680
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,169
We talked about petchoas.

681
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:03,737
Well, what if you took petunias

682
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,173
and you bred them
to be small flowered?

683
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,442
You get the Itsy series.

684
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,744
It's kind of a cute name.

685
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,413
Spreading habit.

686
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,216
Four to six inches tall by one
and a half to two feet wide.

687
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,417
So it's like, well,

688
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,186
"What if a petunia wanted
to grow up

689
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:20,387
to be a <i>calibrachoa</i> ?"

690
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:21,955
Syngenta's Itsy series.

691
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:23,123
This is vegetative.

692
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,858
Okay, here we go.

693
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,828
Get ready to go
"Ooh!" or "Ugh."

694
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,966
RAY Pistachio Cream.

695
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,502
To a professional plants person,

696
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:39,706
this looks like it needs
some nutrition treatment

697
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:42,242
and a pH check of the media.

698
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,679
It is definitely unique.

699
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:48,782
12 to 14 inches tall
by about 12 to 16 inches wide.

700
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,419
Mounded habit,
pretty large flowers.

701
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:56,256
It's not particularly one
I would want to grow personally.

702
00:30:56,323 --> 00:31:01,795
However, in the same series,
RAY Shadow, new for 2025,

703
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:06,033
grows very similar
in terms of size and habit.

704
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,503
The flowers, open yellow
with the dark throat

705
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,440
and then they gradually age
to this rose purple.

706
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,943
Kind of interesting
changing effect

707
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,779
so that every time
you go out in the garden,

708
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,647
that plant is gonna look
a little bit different,

709
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,716
which is pretty cool.

710
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:26,620
We also have the Tea series
of petunias.

711
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:28,622
This is Pink Flamingo,

712
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:31,925
which is a vegetative variety
bred by Kerley & Co

713
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:35,495
out of the UK
and distributed by Beekenkamp,

714
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:39,433
18 to 24 inches tall
and 20 to 28 inches wide.

715
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,168
Kind of an interesting,

716
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,804
antiquey flower color
with the pink

717
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:46,206
and little hints of yellow.

718
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:50,777
We also have other varieties
in the Tea series.

719
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:52,813
Purple Green Edge.

720
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,017
There's been a few different
green edge petunia varieties.

721
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:00,854
This one to me looks
particularly sickly and weak,

722
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:05,492
with the irregular
purple veining in the throat.

723
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:09,530
There's a Supertunia Picasso
in Purple from Proven Winners.

724
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,400
There's a couple of varieties
in the Crazytunia series,

725
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:16,103
the Kermit Rose
and the Kermit Purple.

726
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,938
Again, if you like 'em, great.

727
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,673
Go to town.

728
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:23,177
Probably not gonna see 'em
in my garden.

729
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,546
Petunia Painted Love,

730
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,348
which you'd think
that '80s music fans

731
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,683
might appreciate the name,

732
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,086
and there could be
a marketing plan.

733
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:36,323
So purple
with white throat and edge.

734
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,692
So you get,
we saw some varieties

735
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,494
with the white edge and purple,

736
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:43,297
but this one adds the throat,
so it's kind of nice.

737
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:47,367
This one's a little bit of
a mounded semi-spreading habit.

738
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:50,537
Now we're gonna talk
GMO again.

739
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:52,272
Try to calm down.

740
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:54,775
Petunia Firefly.

741
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:59,713
This has genes from fungi
that glow in the dark,

742
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,383
so it glows in the dark.

743
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:07,487
It's definitely different
and unique.

744
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:10,424
It was awarded by <i>Time</i> magazine

745
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,727
one of the best inventions
of 2024.

746
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,464
It's not the kind of thing
that, you know,

747
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:19,299
you're gonna turn out
the lights,

748
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,101
and it's gonna be,
like, lighting up the room.

749
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,337
It's the kind of thing
where it's in a dark room

750
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,038
and you go into the dark room

751
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:30,110
and your eyes slowly adjust,
and it slowly shows up.

752
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,845
It's kind of cool.

753
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,182
It's pretty expensive.

754
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:39,319
It's actually, the company,
the trial garden photo of Raker,

755
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:42,856
they are the exclusive
propagator for North America,

756
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,458
and they will happily sell you

757
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,860
and ship you a plant
directly to your door.

758
00:33:46,927 --> 00:33:50,430
It's 30 bucks for a 4-inch pot
and 30 bucks for shipping.

759
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,499
[audience laughing]

760
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,941
We're all gonna run out
and order those now, right?

761
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:02,142
Yes.

762
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,878
So, <i>Portulaca,</i> another crop

763
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,549
that maybe hasn't been
on people's radar.

764
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:10,217
In the old days, there was,
like,

765
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:13,353
what I used to call the
cow patty, mounded habit.

766
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,322
Double-flowered ones from seed.

767
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,291
Kind of an old lady plant.

768
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,026
No offense.

769
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:23,997
These guys are
vegetative selections

770
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:27,367
that are more spreading
or trailing habits.

771
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,970
Most of them, but not all
of them, have single flowers.

772
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:31,305
The flowers are larger.

773
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:34,541
These are really good heat,
drought-tolerant plants.

774
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:37,211
And they're
good pollinator plants as well,

775
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:39,313
at least
the single-flowered ones.

776
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:43,150
This one,
the MEGA PAZZAZ from Danziger.

777
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:45,152
You know they got
a regular PAZZAZ, right,

778
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,588
if they got a MEGA PAZZAZ?

779
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:50,591
And they'll probably
come up with GIGA PAZZAZ

780
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,559
in a couple of years.

781
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:57,798
This particular variety was
the Best of Trials winner

782
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,567
at the Commercial Growers
of Wisconsin trial in Verona.

783
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:02,936
So really good variety
in a trial

784
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,739
where it got no care whatsoever.

785
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:10,410
Looked great, spread well,
pollinators loved it.

786
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:14,581
Definitely want to keep
your eye out for <i>Portulacas.</i>

787
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:18,652
The MEGA PAZZAZ Papaya Twist
is new for 2025,

788
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,521
has a nice bicolor.

789
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:23,190
Pretty cool,
again, single flower.

790
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:26,126
Should make
the pollinators happy.

791
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:27,461
A good spreading habit.

792
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:29,062
You can use it
as a ground cover.

793
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,431
It's also great in containers.

794
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:36,336
We've also got the MEGA PAZZAZ
Tropical Twist new for 2025.

795
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:38,939
A little bit more
of a subtle bicolor.

796
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,741
Similar habit.

797
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,409
Are we tired
of MEGA PAZZAZ yet?

798
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,444
We have Mango Twist.

799
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,414
This one's a couple years old.

800
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,350
Again, a pretty nice bicolor.

801
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:53,754
Similar habit and size
to the other varieties.

802
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,491
Could work well in combination
with them

803
00:35:57,558 --> 00:36:00,327
or with MEGA PAZZAZ
Pink Twist.

804
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:02,062
New in 2023.

805
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:04,498
There are other breeders

806
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:07,334
that are doing these <i>Portulacas</i>
vegetatively.

807
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:10,437
The SeaGlass series
from Westhoff.

808
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:11,605
Vivid bicolors.

809
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:13,106
This one performed really well

810
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:16,076
at the Plantpeddler Trials
in Iowa.

811
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:20,047
There's also
some double-flowered ones,

812
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:25,886
which I don't particularly think
are attractive.

813
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,356
The color clash is
kind of shocking,

814
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:32,192
and the flower form
is kind of funky.

815
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:35,896
They're a little better when
they're single color, I think,

816
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:38,131
but that's my opinion.

817
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,400
Again, these are gonna be
heat and drought tolerant,

818
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:45,105
very similar to the habit of the
other colors in the series.

819
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:47,641
Proven Winners also has
the Mojave series.

820
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,276
This is a shot
from the Verona trial,

821
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,911
so you can see
they're out there.

822
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,813
They're looking good,
we got fuchsia.

823
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,948
We got mango, we got pink,
we got red tangerine.

824
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,683
We got yellow.

825
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,388
And those fonts look like
they scooched over a little bit.

826
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:05,993
So tangerine should go
a little towards yellow.

827
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,160
So these were all good.

828
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:10,364
Performed quite well overall
in the trials.

829
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,299
Not as wide a color range

830
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:14,434
as the other two series
I just mentioned.

831
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:18,572
There's also a Cupcake series
from D?mmen,

832
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,075
which did not appreciate
the trial's conditions as much

833
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:23,410
as some of the other varieties,

834
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:25,846
but this is a
much smaller habit.

835
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,881
This is a compact habit.

836
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:29,383
Would be better in a container,

837
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:31,318
or if you wanted
a massed effect,

838
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:34,321
plant more of them
closer together.

839
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,323
Okay, <i>Rudbeckia hirta.</i>

840
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,225
I told you I loved <i>Rudbeckias.</i>

841
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:41,428
These are vegetatively
propagated <i>Rudbeckias,</i>

842
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,464
which, when the vegetatively
propagated <i>Rudbeckias</i> first came

843
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:47,134
to the market,
I was like, "Really?

844
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,769
Do we need this?"

845
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,271
The answer is these are
really good.

846
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,907
They flower all season long.

847
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:55,142
They have large flowers.

848
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:57,911
There's a series
with fairly uniform habits.

849
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:00,113
Pollinators love 'em.

850
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,816
This one is produced
from tissue culture.

851
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,319
The Bull Plant Genetics.

852
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:06,653
The Sunbeckia series.

853
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,722
These are about
14 to 16 inches tall

854
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:12,226
and there are
13 total varieties.

855
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,495
I'll run through a few
of the more unusual colors.

856
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:18,699
This is Graffiti Peach,
which is a semi-double flower.

857
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:21,668
Sometimes semi-double flowers
in the trade

858
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,270
will be called double flowers,

859
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:25,305
and we're told, don't plant
double-flowered varieties

860
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,140
if you want pollinators.

861
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,308
These are semi-double,

862
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,143
so they still have
pollen-producing

863
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,612
and nectar-producing structures.

864
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:34,648
So they are okay
for pollinators.

865
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:37,985
We have Graffiti Caramel,

866
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,354
which is a nice red
and yellow bicolor.

867
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,222
We've got Graffiti Cherry,

868
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:45,692
which is kind of
that subtle light yellow

869
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,996
or dark cream with red,
which is pretty cool

870
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:51,665
and a pretty unique color
in <i>Rudbeckia hirtas.</i>

871
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:54,234
We also have
some breeding from a company

872
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:57,171
out of Pennsylvania
called Garden Genetics.

873
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,339
Rising Sun Chestnut Gold.

874
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:01,275
The previous, the Sunbeckias
were produced

875
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,476
from tissue culture.

876
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:04,545
So that's a high-tech
laboratory propagation

877
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,880
under sterile techniques
and growing on agar.

878
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:09,283
It's fascinating, and I could
talk for a long time about it,

879
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,817
but I will spare you that.

880
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:12,853
This is produced
from unrooted cuttings,

881
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,856
so it's much easier
to grow a stock plant in a way

882
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,357
that keeps it from flowering.

883
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,560
And then you take cuttings
and you ship them to growers

884
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:20,727
and they root them.

885
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:21,929
Boom.

886
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:24,631
This one has particularly
long-lasting flowers.

887
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:28,268
Individual flowers will last on
a plant for five to six weeks,

888
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:30,204
which is pretty cool.

889
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,306
Potentially, this could be
a really good cut-flower variety

890
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:33,974
for a shorter cut as well.

891
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,977
It's only about
18 to 24 inches tall.

892
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:39,046
And it is day neutral,

893
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:41,548
which is important
to the professional crowd.

894
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:43,717
If you want to have
a <i>Rudbeckia</i> in bloom

895
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:46,787
in the garden center in mid-May,

896
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:49,489
a day-neutral variety
is gonna be helpful

897
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,991
because you don't need
to mess around

898
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,560
with extending the photoperiod
in your greenhouse

899
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,062
to get it to flower,

900
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:59,266
so that's helpful
to the professional market.

901
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:04,271
I want to talk about some <i>Salvia</i>
<i>farinaceas</i> for a little bit.

902
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:07,508
Historically, these were
seed propagated

903
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,109
and there were a number
of good varieties.

904
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:10,644
But now a number of breeders

905
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:12,846
have come up
with vegetative types

906
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,349
that expand the color range.

907
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,484
These are all
good pollinator plants.

908
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:20,888
The species itself
is native to North America,

909
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:24,758
but it's a Southwestern
and Texas native.

910
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:27,995
Heat and drought tolerant,
deer resistant,

911
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,329
good pollinator plants.

912
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:31,365
Even the vegetative selections
are.

913
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,967
The Icon Violet is from D?mmen.

914
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:35,936
And this guy is about

915
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:40,007
18 to 22 inches
by 12 to 16 inches wide,

916
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:42,242
so it's gonna be more
of an upright.

917
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,913
These individual flowers
can make, or individual stems,

918
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,781
can make decent cut flowers.

919
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:50,217
And I've noticed
in the trial gardens this year

920
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:53,020
that a lot of the bicolor
varieties were really,

921
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:56,390
really attractive to bumblebees,
which is cool to see.

922
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,458
So Icon Blue Bicolor.

923
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:03,197
Cathedral from Green Fuse,
similar.

924
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:07,467
It would probably be hard
to tell some of these apart

925
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:09,036
if they were planted
side by side

926
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:12,706
unless they were labeled,
even for a professional.

927
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:14,675
Sometimes you get--

928
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:18,545
This is Sky Blue, a nice light,

929
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:21,281
and then we get
Cathedral Shining Sea.

930
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,483
Is that different enough
to justify developing

931
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,352
a new variety for market?

932
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,087
They thought so.

933
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,490
So these are, these are nice.

934
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:31,825
There's lots of different types.

935
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:35,362
I wouldn't be too uptight
about whose breeding it is.

936
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,130
If you like the color, get it.

937
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:39,666
They're gonna perform very,
very similarly.

938
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:42,703
And then I want to talk
a little bit about one

939
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:47,641
of my favorite monarch
butterfly plants, <i>Tithonia.</i>

940
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:51,378
How many monarch butterflies
can you get in one picture?

941
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:52,546
My record is five.

942
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,114
Not on this plant;
that's on Zinnia,

943
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,484
which we'll talk a bit
in a little bit.

944
00:41:57,551 --> 00:42:00,153
The straight species is
a great plant.

945
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,422
It grows, like,
four to six feet tall.

946
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,157
It's, uh...

947
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:06,093
It's a monarch food plant

948
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,762
when they've migrated back
to where they go, right?

949
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,297
So they're really used to it.

950
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,634
It's a very attractive,
daisy-like flower.

951
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,270
There is a variety from 2000

952
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:19,940
which was an All-America
Selection winner called

953
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:22,943
Fiesta del Sol that grows
only two to three feet tall.

954
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,444
So it's much more manageable.

955
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:26,346
Now, the tall ones,
when they're growing

956
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:30,317
in, say, mid-June, you can
shear 'em back about a third

957
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,120
and that'll promote branching
and keep 'em down a little bit.

958
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:34,888
But they're still tall.

959
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,624
Fiesta del Sol
had some production problems

960
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,926
and it went away.

961
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:40,861
It was not available.

962
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,396
It is now back on the market,

963
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,831
and it's a good variety
and you should check it out.

964
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,367
Monarchs love this plant.

965
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,405
Okay, <i>Verbena bonariensis.</i>

966
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:57,511
This is a 2002 All-American
Selection winner called Vanity.

967
00:42:57,578 --> 00:43:00,881
Historically, this
would grow really tall,

968
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:04,318
one stem with kind of
a neat flower on it,

969
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:08,222
but it was a little bit wild
and weedy for the garden.

970
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:11,091
Breeding has resulted
in shorter plants.

971
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:13,527
This is about 30 inches tall
and it's more branched.

972
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,863
So there's more flowers
per plant.

973
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,232
This is heat tolerant.

974
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:20,000
It is a really good
container plant.

975
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:21,502
It makes a good cut flower.

976
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:24,438
You can grow it
in the landscape as well.

977
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:27,040
Vanity,
there's other varieties.

978
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,710
Finesse from Benary
is a little taller.

979
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:34,114
Lollipop was a vegetative
selection from Aris

980
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:36,650
that grows about two feet.

981
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,252
Proven Winners has one.

982
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,622
So if you see
a <i>Verbena bonariensis</i> out there,

983
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,290
you know,
even if it's not Vanity,

984
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:45,092
it could be a good one
to check out.

985
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:46,493
And Vanity, you can get
from seed.

986
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,828
And it's not hard to grow.

987
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,898
Okay, zinnias,
I love zinnias.

988
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:53,767
I could do an hour on zinnias.

989
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,537
I won't do an hour on zinnias
today.

990
00:43:56,603 --> 00:43:59,173
This is Queeny Lemon Peach,

991
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,677
which is kind of
a unique two-tone bicolor.

992
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:07,848
It was a regional All-America
Selection winner in 2022.

993
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:12,953
This is Swiss breeding that
is distributed by Floragran.

994
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,957
And this is from seed,
and it's commonly available.

995
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:18,292
Makes a really good cut flower.

996
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:20,394
A lot of the specialty
cut flower growers

997
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,365
are using this as an option
to expand their range.

998
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:28,902
And believe it or not,
the last slide.

999
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,539
At least the last slide
with plant pictures.

1000
00:44:32,606 --> 00:44:36,176
This is <i>Zinnia marylandica</i>
Zydeco Fire.

1001
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:40,681
The <i>marylandica</i> types are
interspecific hybrids

1002
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:44,418
so that they have more of a
compact, semi-spreading habit.

1003
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:48,255
This is a very large flowered
one with a nice semi-double

1004
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:50,557
to almost double flower,
heat and drought tolerant.

1005
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:54,294
Grows about 20 inches tall,
long blooming.

1006
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,697
The <i>marylandicas</i>
generally are gonna be

1007
00:44:56,763 --> 00:45:00,300
quite disease resistant
to a lot of the foliar problems

1008
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,704
that some zinnias
can sometimes have.

1009
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,875
And with that, I think we have
some time for some questions.

1010
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:10,177
