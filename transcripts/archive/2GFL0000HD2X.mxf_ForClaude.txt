1
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,216
>> We abuse land

2
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,884
because we regard it

3
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,252
as a commodity belonging to us.

4
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,590
When we see land as a community

5
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,194
to which we belong,

6
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,828
we may begin to use it

7
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:04,265
with love and respect.

8
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,902
Aldo Leopold.

9
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:16,511
I do not imply

10
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,879
that this philosophy of land

11
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,082
is always clear to me.

12
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,783
It is rather the end result

13
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,152
of a life journey.

14
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,000
>> Aldo Leopold is considered

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,168
the most influential

16
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:41,236
conservationist

17
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,271
of the 20th century.

18
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,805
His work revolutionized

19
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,640
the ideal of the natural world,

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,909
and our understanding of

21
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,544
the ever changing relationship

22
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:55,148
between people and the earth.

23
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,051
For more than three decades,

24
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,286
I've been on a journey

25
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,721
in search of Leopold

26
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:03,858
and his legacy in our own time.

27
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,661
As Leopold's biographer, I found

28
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,929
that Leopold connects people and

29
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:10,098
places across the landscape,

30
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:11,533
from cities and suburbs,

31
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,600
to farms and forests

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,436
and ranches,

33
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:17,606
to our most remote wild lands.

34
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,606
I've explored the people,

35
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,241
places, and events

36
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,575
that shaped his thinking.

37
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,710
And that led to

38
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,645
his greatest idea,

39
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,883
the Land Ethic.

40
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,552
>> The land ethic is a result

41
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,221
of understanding

42
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,522
the interrelationships

43
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,491
of the natural system.

44
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,691
It's not something that dad

45
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,260
all of a sudden realized.

46
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,362
It took him a lifetime

47
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,031
to understand how interrelated

48
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,668
we are with the natural system.

49
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,035
Never did we have perspective

50
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,705
on this

51
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,908
until we all finally grew up.

52
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,743
>> Here, on a once abandoned

53
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,044
farm in the sand counties

54
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,313
of central Wisconsin,

55
00:02:58,313 --> 00:02:59,514
the Leopold family made their

56
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,083
own connection to the land.

57
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:02,950
Since the publication

58
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,218
of Leopold's book,

59
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,820
"A Sand County Almanac,"

60
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,155
this place has come to

61
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:08,356
symbolize the effort to build

62
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,757
a healthier relationship

63
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,959
between people and nature.

64
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,695
And now, all these years later,

65
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,296
you get to see people coming

66
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,197
from all over the world

67
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,965
to visit.

68
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,809
>> For a white pine and a red

69
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,110
birch are crowding each other...

70
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,345
>> That I love all trees,

71
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,846
but I am in love with pines...

72
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,148
>> And become scarcer...

73
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:37,185
[reading in foreign language]

74
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,519
>> It is an extension

75
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,888
of ethics...

76
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,056
>> It's astonishing to me

77
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,158
and exciting

78
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,660
to see how the shack

79
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,295
has attracted people.

80
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,896
My father would be

81
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,199
absolutely amazed.

82
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,899
>> The amazing thing is after

83
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,034
all these years,

84
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,035
the interest in Leopold

85
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,436
just continues to grow.

86
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,538
Here's this fellow who died

87
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:59,073
in 1948, 60 years ago,

88
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,875
and yet he is still read

89
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,243
as a contemporary,

90
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,411
because his ideas

91
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,646
are still not only so current,

92
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:07,515
he's still so far ahead of us.

93
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:08,616
>> It has taken, you know,

94
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:09,717
40, 50 or 60 years

95
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,119
for us to catch up

96
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,154
with the very clear meanings

97
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,322
of the words

98
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,623
that he was writing,

99
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,991
in some cases in the late '20s,

100
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,125
certainly through the '30s

101
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,494
and the '40s.

102
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:20,895
>> What I now refer to

103
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:22,530
as the holy trinity

104
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,266
are Henry David Thoreau,

105
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,102
John Muir and Aldo Leopold,

106
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,304
as the giants

107
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,374
on whose shoulders we stand.

108
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,942
>> We have lost sight

109
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,579
of so much magic in the land,

110
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,248
spiritual values,

111
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,250
so it is time, certainly,

112
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,552
to construct

113
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,288
or reconstruct an ethic.

114
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,790
>> Even though he used

115
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,558
the language, "Land Ethic,"

116
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,959
he was really talking about

117
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,660
an "Earth Ethic."

118
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,597
That earth ethic

119
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,032
is as relevant today,

120
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,268
more relevant today

121
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:06,807
than it has ever been before.

122
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,810
>> Leopold was a forester

123
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,877
and a scientist, a teacher,

124
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,046
and a writer.

125
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,548
But above all, he was a careful

126
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,015
and deeply curious observer

127
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,184
of the natural world.

128
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,986
>> Dad took phenological

129
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,521
records.

130
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,989
He was recording the natural

131
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,991
events of the season,

132
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,859
the first blooming of plants,

133
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,927
the arrival of birds,

134
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,429
and so forth.

135
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,399
So, here am I, age 91.

136
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,967
Guess what I am doing?

137
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,135
I'm keeping phenological

138
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:36,170
records.

139
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,940
I keep track of about 350 items,

140
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,710
which really is one way

141
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,447
of monitoring climate change.

142
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,049
It's a very, very critical time.

143
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,486
Keeping phenological records

144
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:54,221
is not only a great sport,

145
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,591
but it does give us an idea

146
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,259
of monitoring the changes

147
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,196
in the climate.

148
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,765
>> Leopold did not know

149
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:04,865
about climate change

150
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,133
or the other pressing

151
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,635
conservation issues we now face

152
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,170
on a global scale.

153
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:10,938
He did, however, observe

154
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,139
firsthand the fundamental

155
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,641
changes taking place

156
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,176
on the American landscape

157
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,110
during his boyhood

158
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,579
in the late 1800s.

159
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,783
Railroads were opening the West.

160
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:23,184
The prairies of the Midwest

161
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:25,219
were being plowed up.

162
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,521
The pine forests of the lake

163
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,289
states were being cutover, with

164
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,724
the timber floated down river

165
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,058
and carried by rail

166
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,595
to build the country.

167
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,030
>> Man always kills

168
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,764
the thing he loves.

169
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,334
And so we the pioneers

170
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,670
have killed our wilderness.

171
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,272
Some say we had to.

172
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,740
Be that as it may, I am glad

173
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,109
I shall never be young

174
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,378
without wild country

175
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:54,916
to be young in.

176
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,418
>> Leopold was born in 1887,

177
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,853
here along the Mississippi River

178
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,588
in Burlington, Iowa, where

179
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,456
the railroad and the river,

180
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,624
the two great axes of American

181
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,894
development came together.

182
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,596
>> Aldo was raised

183
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,830
in this environment here,

184
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,065
where there was

185
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,166
plenty of opportunity

186
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,668
for wandering around

187
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:14,836
and experiencing things,

188
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:17,438
and discovering things.

189
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:17,971
But that was just half of it.

190
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,908
The other half

191
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,342
was that he had parents

192
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:22,910
that pushed him out there,

193
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,645
encouraged him to go out there

194
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,580
and use that youthful

195
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,314
imagination.

196
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,750
>> Aldo Leopold's mother, Clara,

197
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,950
encouraged his observational

198
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,452
skills, his writing,

199
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,454
and his aesthetic sense.

200
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,388
She was a great appreciator

201
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,890
of the opera.

202
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,591
It was one of her passions

203
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,991
in life.

204
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,193
And because binoculars

205
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,127
were not so easily available

206
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,395
for bird watching

207
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,530
at that point in history,

208
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,298
Aldo borrowed her opera glasses.

209
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,266
That was his first

210
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,201
set of binoculars.

211
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,736
>> At a very early age,

212
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,237
Aldo was out here in the yard,

213
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,706
monitoring in his journals,

214
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:52,973
13 different wren nests

215
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,475
in this yard,

216
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,376
which is a remarkable thing

217
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,144
for an 11 year old.

218
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,412
>> He must've really

219
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,480
picked that up from his father,

220
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,749
others in the family.

221
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,183
Aldo's father, Carl,

222
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,485
he was a conservationist

223
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,853
before there was such a thing

224
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,988
as a conservation movement.

225
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,323
Carl loved the outdoors.

226
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,357
He loved to hunt.

227
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,826
He loved to fish.

228
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:12,927
He loved bringing his children

229
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,962
into contact with that world.

230
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,330
As Aldo grew up

231
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,732
as the oldest son in the family,

232
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,000
Carl was the one who really

233
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,434
taught him that what you do

234
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,136
in the outdoors

235
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,371
reflects your set of ethics,

236
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,107
your sense of responsibility

237
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,776
for the world that you exist in.

238
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,711
It was Carl who helped his son

239
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,379
with this ethic that would grow

240
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,815
over decades into what

241
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,449
we now call the Land Ethic.

242
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,491
So I have not been devoted

243
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,025
to telling of Leopold's story

244
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,061
simply for its own sake.

245
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,362
I have been most interested in

246
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,397
how we can learn from Leopold,

247
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,132
how we can take from his story,

248
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,233
things that are relevant

249
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,902
to the challenges

250
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,638
and opportunities of today.

251
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,873
>> Welcome

252
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,240
toUniversity of the Air.

253
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,175
>> Our guest is Curt Meine.

254
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:02,476
>> Thank you so much

255
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,711
for having me.

256
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,145
>> When I saw Aldo Leopold's

257
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,615
birth date of 1887,

258
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,815
it came as sort of a shock,

259
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,885
just because he seems

260
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,119
such a modern figure.

261
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,354
Tell us about your sense

262
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,822
of Leopold

263
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,791
and his place in history.

264
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,092
>> The aspect of Leopold that

265
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,660
makes him unique in our history

266
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,994
is how he connects

267
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,095
what's going on now

268
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,263
and into the future with

269
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,732
the deep origins of conservation

270
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,767
and environmental thought.

271
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:27,768
Now we're moving into

272
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,203
a new phase.

273
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,805
We don't know what this next

274
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,506
maybe post-environmentalism

275
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,141
phase is going to be,

276
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,210
or what it's becoming.

277
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,211
But Leopold is still right there

278
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,280
in the middle.

279
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,049
>> It think Aldo Leopold

280
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,018
is the philosopher

281
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,386
who stands between conservation

282
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,554
and the modern

283
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:48,723
environmental movement.

284
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,624
>> I think he is perhaps

285
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,961
the fundamental guiding light

286
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,830
in the development

287
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,798
of modern conservation biology.

288
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,166
>> One of the influences for me

289
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,401
of Aldo Leopold is realizing

290
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,468
that I wanted a life

291
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,337
in conservation,

292
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,505
more than I was interested

293
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,306
in a career in conservation.

294
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,675
So the way it looks for me

295
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,944
is living on a piece of land,

296
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,111
and caring for that land

297
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,713
as best that I

298
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,482
and my family can.

299
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,251
>> People who say that they're

300
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,354
students of Leopold,

301
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,890
or disciples of Leopold,

302
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,193
or influenced by Leopold,

303
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:28,729
maybe it's our responsibility

304
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:35,068
to look at the whole Leopold.

305
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,438
>> As Leopold was growing up,

306
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:38,906
the Midwestern landscape

307
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,875
was changing dramatically.

308
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,142
Its prairies

309
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,477
were being plowed under.

310
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,312
Its forests cut, and its rivers

311
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,014
and wetlands transformed

312
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,783
by dams, dikes and dredges.

313
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,758
They lived at a time

314
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,993
when the water fowl

315
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,260
along the Mississippi flyway

316
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,230
were being depleted.

317
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,799
Market hunting

318
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,300
was still an important force.

319
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,668
There was minimal concern

320
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,102
about the decline of wildlife,

321
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,437
such as the bison

322
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,772
and passenger pigeon, which

323
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,206
were headed toward extinction

324
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,075
when Leopold was a boy.

325
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,280
>> For one species to mourn

326
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,817
the death of another

327
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,751
is a new thing under the sun.

328
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,463
>> Aldo Leopold came of age

329
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,698
as the conservation movement

330
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,167
grew to maturity.

331
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,134
Back then, if you were

332
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:41,935
a young person

333
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,671
interested in conservation,

334
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,638
there was only one profession

335
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,973
you could enter.

336
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,240
And that was forestry.

337
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,542
So, Aldo Leopold was

338
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,944
part of that first generation

339
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,378
of American foresters.

340
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,380
Many trained at Yale

341
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,481
and then went off to work

342
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,983
for the U.S. Forest Service,

343
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,218
going to places that most

344
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:59,687
of them had never even heard of.

345
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:01,889
After graduating in 1909,

346
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,323
Leopold's assignment

347
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,324
was to go to the brand new

348
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,626
Apache National Forest

349
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:06,861
in what was then

350
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:07,761
not even a state.

351
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,030
It was still

352
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,597
the Arizona Territory.

353
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,239
Well, he takes the railroad

354
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,640
out to the Painted Desert

355
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,308
in northeastern Arizona.

356
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,910
He gets off at Holbrook,

357
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,578
one of the stops along the line,

358
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,047
and looks south across

359
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:28,114
the vast expanse of the desert.

360
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,383
He could see

361
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,617
a distant line of green

362
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,952
on the horizon.

363
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,221
That was the Apache National

364
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,120
Forest, created just recently

365
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,222
by the signature

366
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,925
of Teddy Roosevelt.

367
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,160
Like other foresters, he

368
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,095
was starting from the beginning,

369
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,329
so he got his proper ranger

370
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,664
outfit, and he did have to

371
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:45,766
go buy his own horse.

372
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,234
Aldo Leopold's first real job

373
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,669
in the Forest Service

374
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,004
was to go out and measure

375
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:55,475
the Apache National Forest.

376
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:57,644
One of the best known passages

377
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,080
of Leopold's writing describes

378
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,714
an event that occurred

379
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,482
at the very start of his career,

380
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,319
when he saw a fierce green fire

381
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,122
in the eyes of a dying wolf.

382
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,590
Yet the full meaning

383
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,624
of that experience eluded him

384
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,492
for many years.

385
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,161
Imagine this.

386
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,061
Aldo is, how old is he?

387
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,830
He's 22.

388
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,266
>> Twenty-two.

389
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,767
>> Twenty-two years old.

390
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,202
Less than two weeks on the job,

391
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:22,970
his first or second free Sunday,

392
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,504
he comes out here.

393
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,238
Here's where the green fire

394
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,708
started.

395
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,709
It's always struck me

396
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:29,910
as entirely fitting

397
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,978
that he started his career

398
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,046
in the Forest Service

399
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,247
with a moment that

400
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:34,448
he didn't even fully understand.

401
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,618
It would take 35 years

402
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,754
for that moment to emerge

403
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,723
in his own writing fully.

404
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,062
>> Only the mountain

405
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,763
has lived long enough

406
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,332
to listen objectively

407
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,802
to the howl of a wolf...

408
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,036
My own conviction

409
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,404
on this score

410
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,572
dates from the day

411
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,007
I saw a wolf die.

412
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,676
We were eating lunch

413
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,311
on the high rim rock,

414
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,479
at the foot of which

415
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,680
a turbulent river

416
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,150
elbowed its way.

417
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,517
We saw what we thought

418
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,252
was a doe fording the torrent,

419
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,687
her breast awash

420
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,990
in white water.

421
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,890
When she climbed the bank

422
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,159
toward us,

423
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,693
and shook out her tail,

424
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,062
we realized our error.

425
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,364
It was a wolf.

426
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,375
>> As a young forester, Leopold

427
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,677
was in a precarious position.

428
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,045
He had to enforce new grazing

429
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,947
regulations in communities

430
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,148
that had long had unrestricted

431
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,185
use of the public lands.

432
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:45,786
Over the next decade,

433
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,221
as Leopold traveled extensively

434
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,123
throughout the Southwest,

435
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,557
he became deeply interested

436
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,591
in the changes that had

437
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,260
taken place in the land,

438
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,761
especially the impact

439
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:59,232
of severe overgrazing.

440
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,934
>> I mean, we were out here

441
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,336
to conquer this country,

442
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,237
not to make it better.

443
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,043
I knew nothing

444
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,078
about this country,

445
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,546
but I had a large family

446
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,881
and a small ranch.

447
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,182
And it's self-defense.

448
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:15,849
I had to figure out a way

449
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,317
to grow more grass

450
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,518
for the livestock

451
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,553
and more wildlife habitat

452
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,687
for the wildlife.

453
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,588
I had to figure it out,

454
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,857
so I did.

455
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,294
My wife got a book

456
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,031
about Leopold,

457
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,500
and I began to read about him

458
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,336
and see what he did.

459
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,870
I thought, boy, if I'd

460
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,672
just read this 30 years ago,

461
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,341
I could've saved a lot of time

462
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:42,209
and effort, because

463
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,877
he already knew all the things

464
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,612
I was learning.

465
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:51,818
>> Early in his Forest Service

466
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,653
career, Leopold began to see

467
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,022
the important connections

468
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,523
between his work

469
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,958
and the health of the land.

470
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,026
He would write to his

471
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,194
fellow foresters that,

472
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,528
"We are responsible,

473
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:02,529
not just for this or that

474
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,031
particular resource.

475
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,466
We are responsible

476
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,499
for the well being of the forest

477
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,469
as a whole."

478
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,970
That shift in perspective

479
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,538
would make all the difference.

480
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,012
>> Our job is to sharpen

481
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,914
our tools and make them cut

482
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,583
the right way...

483
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,918
The sole measure of our

484
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,987
success is the effect

485
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,489
which they have on the forest.

486
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,833
>> Leopold began to realize

487
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,468
that the forest environment

488
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,238
included soils, waters, plants,

489
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,006
and animals.

490
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,341
They were all

491
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,642
part of the system.

492
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,911
He was one of the first people

493
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,180
to begin to look at the role

494
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,815
of fire to protect

495
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,283
those southwestern watersheds.

496
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,856
>> The fact that I did burning,

497
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,392
and wanted to do more, was

498
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:09,196
a mystery to all my neighbors.

499
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,563
And because I was the new kid

500
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,466
on the block, they thought

501
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,101
I was just too young and dumb

502
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,636
to know any better.

503
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:16,703
They were scared I was going to

504
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,506
set their ranch on fire.

505
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,275
My real objective here

506
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,343
would be to get it back to

507
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:24,011
an open savannah,

508
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:27,414
like it was in 1850.

509
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,849
I just kept burning, and people

510
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,384
began to see it might work.

511
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,292
>> Leopold's experience

512
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,493
in the ranching communities

513
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,061
in the Southwest really

514
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,229
taught him that you can't solve

515
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,730
any conservation problem

516
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,132
if you don't address

517
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,700
human relationships, as well as

518
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,368
human land relationships.

519
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,406
>> There are two things

520
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,441
that interest me:

521
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,608
the relation of people

522
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,677
to each other,

523
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,879
and the relation of people

524
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,481
to land.

525
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,085
>> He entered a landscape

526
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,921
very different from the Midwest.

527
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,223
There were, of course,

528
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:10,457
the many Native tribes,

529
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,092
Anglo ranchers from Texas,

530
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,460
and Hispanic families that had

531
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,598
lived there for centuries.

532
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,434
>> Mother came from

533
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,536
a family from Spain

534
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,136
that came over with Cortez,

535
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,340
and came up through Mexico,

536
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,675
and settled in New Mexico,

537
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,077
for bigger sheep ranches.

538
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,544
I've often realized

539
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,879
that mother's family

540
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,248
had a lot to do with

541
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:36,550
the overgrazing of the West.

542
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,485
And here she married dad,

543
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,354
the forester, and together,

544
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:43,023
they blended very well.

545
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,663
Mother was teaching school,

546
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,898
and dad was a young forester,

547
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,334
having just graduated from Yale.

548
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,836
>> He was up in the north part

549
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,505
of the state, being very busy

550
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,974
as a forest supervisor.

551
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,277
She was living down in Santa Fe.

552
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,978
So he had to write to her

553
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,179
letters, and he courted her

554
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,048
by mail, basically.

555
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,349
The letters between them

556
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,951
are really quite touching.

557
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,486
It was the basis

558
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,954
for a lifelong partnership.

559
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:20,827
>> My dear Estella.

560
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,796
This night is so wonderful

561
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,698
that it almost hurts...

562
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,967
I would like to be

563
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,469
out in our canyon...

564
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:29,736
and see the wild Clematis

565
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,305
in the moonlight.

566
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:33,339
Wouldn't you?

567
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,109
>> Aldo married into

568
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,377
one of the preeminent

569
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,914
ranching families in the West.

570
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,382
It gave Leopold a very different

571
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,883
appreciation of the cultural

572
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,587
dimensions of conservation.

573
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:47,787
In the long run, it would feed

574
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,523
his understanding that

575
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,457
conservation is not only about

576
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,758
the land's ecological

577
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,660
relationships,

578
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,462
but also about our own

579
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,229
communities and cultures.

580
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,635
Aldo and Estella would

581
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,704
eventually have five children,

582
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,771
and each one would become

583
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,972
a prominent scientist

584
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,140
and conservationist

585
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,177
in their own right.

586
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,445
The family spent much time

587
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,747
together in the outdoors.

588
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,282
These trips were often motivated

589
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,784
by Aldo's great love of hunting.

590
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,853
As a young forester,

591
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,121
Leopold wanted to increase game

592
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,690
populations, but neither he

593
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,591
nor anyone else understood

594
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,426
the complex relationships

595
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,760
connecting predators, prey,

596
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,330
people, and forests.

597
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,632
Instead, he acted on the simple

598
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,400
premise that fewer predators

599
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,703
meant more game.

600
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:36,970
>> Leopold actually received

601
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,971
permission from the

602
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,373
Forest Service to travel

603
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:40,708
throughout the Southwest,

604
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,108
organizing game protective

605
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,644
associations that would

606
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,780
work for game protection.

607
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,114
>> So, he was of his generation

608
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,583
and time.

609
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,850
To kill a predator

610
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,819
was no big deal.

611
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,024
>> I personally believed,

612
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,327
at least in 1914,

613
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,896
when predator control began,

614
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,398
that there could not be

615
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:06,466
too much horned game, and that

616
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,535
the extirpation of predators

617
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,804
was a reasonable price to pay

618
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,173
for better big game hunting.

619
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,144
>> Due in part to the

620
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,413
government's campaign against

621
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,014
predators, wolves would

622
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,482
eventually disappear from

623
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:26,986
the mountains of the Southwest.

624
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:28,589
>> In those days,

625
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,056
we had never heard

626
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,258
of passing up the chance

627
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,493
to kill a wolf.

628
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,961
In a second, we were

629
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,063
pumping lead into the pack,

630
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,198
but with more excitement

631
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,367
than accuracy.

632
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,737
When our rifles were empty,

633
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,605
the old wolf was down

634
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,873
and a pup

635
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,341
was dragging a leg

636
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,810
into impassable slide rocks.

637
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,247
>> Leopold wrote

638
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,415
"Thinking Like a Mountain"

639
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,784
many years after the

640
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:58,251
wolf shooting incident occurred.

641
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,753
The essay is, in many ways,

642
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:00,620
about the ability to change

643
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,256
our ideas.

644
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,358
>> Later in his career,

645
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,294
Leopold began to realize that

646
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,896
deer could be very destructive

647
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,098
to the forest

648
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,968
if their numbers increased.

649
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,670
So Leopold himself recommended

650
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,338
the removal of bounties

651
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,440
on wolves.

652
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,742
One of the most

653
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:23,910
successful areas in which

654
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,045
he began to pursue his ideas

655
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:29,215
was the Gila National Forest.

656
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,817
As deer populations increased

657
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,419
there, he began to go

658
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,254
into the Gila with horses

659
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:35,822
and pack stock

660
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,625
on long hunting trips.

661
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,461
He began to realize that there

662
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,797
was potential for developing

663
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,699
a new kind of recreational

664
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,501
experience in the forests,

665
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,102
what he called

666
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,837
wilderness hunting grounds.

667
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,810
>> Wilderness is the one kind

668
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,379
of playground which mankind

669
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,683
cannot build to order...

670
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,050
I contrived to get

671
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,686
the Gila headwaters

672
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:09,690
withdrawn as a wilderness area,

673
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,693
to be kept as pack country,

674
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:14,160
free from additional roads,

675
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,229
forever.

676
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,266
>> Roads were spreading

677
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,568
across the country, threatening

678
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,437
the last great wild areas.

679
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,772
So he began working to protect

680
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,207
the larger expanses

681
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,241
of undeveloped land

682
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,878
in the Southwest.

683
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:32,512
This led to the designation

684
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,214
of the Gila Wilderness Area

685
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:38,051
on the Gila Forest in 1924.

686
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:39,586
It was the first federally

687
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,688
designated wilderness area,

688
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,122
40 years before Congress

689
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,124
passed the Wilderness Act.

690
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,898
Leopold championed

691
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,834
our remote wild lands,

692
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,101
but he understood that wildness

693
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,135
can be found anywhere,

694
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,971
even in our largest cities.

695
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,939
>> We're gonna grow

696
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,074
some carrots.

697
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,442
Is everybody ready?

698
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,944
>> Yeah.

699
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,512
>> These seeds are very small.

700
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,947
I want you to put one or two

701
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,281
of those seeds in the holes,

702
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,517
okay?

703
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,620
Yes, in there for me.

704
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,789
This is 3-1/2 acres here.

705
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:16,822
>> It wasn't always as pretty

706
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,458
as it is now?

707
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,059
>> Oh, no.

708
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,828
Its history was a 35-year-old

709
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,129
illegal dump site.

710
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,665
The community actually

711
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,400
called it Dead Man's Alley,

712
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,335
because a few dead bodies

713
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,737
had been dumped here

714
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,004
in those 35 years.

715
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,140
So, basically, there's so many

716
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,043
things taking place

717
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:37,577
in a former illegal dump site,

718
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:38,911
you'll be amazed.

719
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,979
We have a prairie.

720
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,180
We have a wetland.

721
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,549
We have a children's

722
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:43,750
petting zoo.

723
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,818
We have a Potawatomi

724
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,286
Indian village.

725
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:47,320
And we've got garden over here

726
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,688
teaching people

727
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,957
how to grow food.

728
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,024
It's amazing what you can do

729
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:51,925
in these little bitty spaces,

730
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,293
trying to reconnect this

731
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:56,396
community back to the land.

732
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:58,231
>> The land ethic, this idea

733
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,666
that we're part of a community

734
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,100
includes the land

735
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,637
and the land includes us.

736
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:04,871
It doesn't matter where you are.

737
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,073
It doesn't matter if you're

738
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,340
in the most remote wild place

739
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,541
or if you're in the heart

740
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,243
of a big city like Chicago.

741
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:11,077
It doesn't matter where you are.

742
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:11,978
>> It doesn't matter.

743
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,313
Nature is here.

744
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,881
It's everywhere to be found.

745
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,750
We've got to really change

746
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,051
the mindset of so many people,

747
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,419
especially in urban environments

748
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:20,754
that are so disconnected

749
00:25:20,754 --> 00:25:22,622
from the land.

750
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:23,590
I had the biggest argument

751
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,658
with a student,

752
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:25,892
who argued with me

753
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:26,726
where the eggs in our hen house

754
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,328
came from.

755
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:29,796
I was showing him Henrietta,

756
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,798
our chicken layer,

757
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,065
and he was saying,

758
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,634
she didn't lay that egg.

759
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,670
"That egg came from Jewels."

760
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,803
I said, "You mean the grocery

761
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,439
store?"

762
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,440
He said, "Yeah, that's

763
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,474
where it came from,

764
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:42,676
the grocery store."

765
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:43,777
I said, "Where do you think

766
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:45,012
the grocery store got it from?"

767
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,479
Then he thought about it

768
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,413
and he said, "It came from

769
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,548
the grocery store."

770
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,383
[laughs]

771
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:54,120
>> There are two

772
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,188
spiritual dangers

773
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:57,089
in not owning a farm.

774
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,591
One is the danger

775
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,293
of supposing that breakfast

776
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:01,962
comes from the grocery,

777
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,563
and the other that heat

778
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:10,136
comes from a furnace.

779
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,605
>> In the late spring of 1924,

780
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,473
Leopold made a major

781
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:14,673
career move.

782
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,108
He returned

783
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,310
to the upper Midwest,

784
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,879
to Madison, Wisconsin,

785
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,112
where he accepted a new position

786
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,648
as Assistant Director of

787
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,985
the Forest Products Laboratory.

788
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,386
After several years,

789
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,921
Leopold left the Forest Service

790
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,188
to devote himself to his most

791
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:32,659
compelling interest, wildlife.

792
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,527
For three years, he conducted

793
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,329
unprecedented surveys

794
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,331
of game populations and habitats

795
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:42,069
across the Midwestern states.

796
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,171
Then, in 1933, he published

797
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:46,138
the first text in the new field,

798
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,774
"Game Management,"

799
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,442
and became its first professor

800
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,411
at the University of Wisconsin,

801
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,212
where he would help develop

802
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,547
this new idea of ecological

803
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,148
restoration at the Arboretum.

804
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,652
>> It's always amazing to me,

805
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:00,453
that he could

806
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:01,922
look into the future

807
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:03,023
without having a lot

808
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,156
of role models to follow.

809
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,992
He had this vision that

810
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,794
we could rebuild on this site,

811
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,463
prairies, savannahs and forests

812
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,998
that were here, and rebuild them

813
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,366
the way they were

814
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,103
before European settlement.

815
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,103
They went out and foraged

816
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,438
over the landscape and

817
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:21,174
found small remnant prairies,

818
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,575
collected sods, collected seeds,

819
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,310
collected plants,

820
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,812
and brought them here

821
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:26,846
and established the species

822
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,548
that used to be there.

823
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:33,185
>> If a land mechanism

824
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,788
as a whole is good,

825
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,456
then every part is good,

826
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:37,457
whether we understand it

827
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:39,926
or not...

828
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:41,962
To keep every cog and wheel

829
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,730
is the first precaution

830
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,399
of intelligent tinkering.

831
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,845
>> My father was head

832
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,046
of the University of Wisconsin

833
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,916
Arboretum in the '30s.

834
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,417
I think he was enjoying

835
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,253
that process so much that

836
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,520
he decided he wanted to do it

837
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,355
on his own land.

838
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,456
That's when he got

839
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,258
this property.

840
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,395
>> On this sand farm

841
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,665
in Wisconsin, first worn out

842
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,167
and then abandoned by our

843
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,468
bigger and better society,

844
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:23,903
we try to rebuild,

845
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,939
with shovel and axe,

846
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:28,274
what we are losing elsewhere.

847
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,809
It is here that we seek,

848
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,377
and still find,

849
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,479
our meat from God.

850
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:37,750
>> I remember dad at dinner

851
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,485
one evening said that he had

852
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:40,954
bought some land

853
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:42,822
up in the sand counties

854
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,525
along the Wisconsin River.

855
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,460
We all had dreams of

856
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,896
a little cabin covered in vines,

857
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,163
where we would sit on the porch

858
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,566
and watch the water.

859
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,668
Not so.

860
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,340
We finally got in

861
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,109
to see this place,

862
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,744
and it was corn stubble

863
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,046
and cockle burrs

864
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,181
as far as you could see.

865
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,650
The old shed that remained

866
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,886
was the old chicken coop.

867
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,453
It was waist deep

868
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,855
in frozen manure.

869
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,157
>> Our first task

870
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:17,890
was to get rid of the manure

871
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,859
that had accumulated

872
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,394
in this little shed

873
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:22,294
that was the only building

874
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,730
left standing

875
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,130
after the house burned down.

876
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:26,966
>> There were no windows.

877
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,034
There was just an opening

878
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,602
for the door.

879
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,137
I say my mother was a saint.

880
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,472
She said,

881
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,142
"Oh, okay, all right..."

882
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,343
But as soon as we started

883
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,679
fixing it up,

884
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,213
we all became addicted.

885
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:49,221
We just loved it.

886
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:50,857
>> When my husband

887
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,692
found this little place,

888
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,226
which was a worn out farm,

889
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,661
he decided to buy it

890
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,965
to see what could be done.

891
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,801
>> The shack was as close

892
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,137
to nothing as you could get,

893
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,705
and still it was everything.

894
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,506
It's where we learned to work.

895
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,575
Where we learned to be together,

896
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,111
and to sing, and it just

897
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:13,078
pulled the family together.

898
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,785
It was seven us, and the dog,

899
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,254
and usually a pet or two.

900
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:25,357
It was quite a cheerful place.

901
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,759
>> There's one thing

902
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,061
that my husband always said,

903
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,762
and which we kept to,

904
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,430
"Never take anything up there

905
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,498
that isn't absolutely

906
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,168
necessary."

907
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,970
>> We always had the guitar.

908
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,638
There was always a gun,

909
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:41,074
the picnic basket, the dog.

910
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:43,242
The essentials.

911
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,713
I think fundamental

912
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,582
to everything was this

913
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,651
absolutely wonderful marriage

914
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:53,051
between my mother and my father.

915
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,091
>> You haven't any idea how much

916
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:00,059
pleasure I have gotten

917
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,427
out of going into the country

918
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:05,832
with my husband.

919
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,667
>> It seemed to me that

920
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,468
that was one of the happiest

921
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:16,442
marriages I know of.

922
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,377
He'd say, "Your mother and I

923
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,578
are going to the shack

924
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,980
for the weekend.

925
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,515
Anybody want to come?"

926
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:23,783
And of course,

927
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,251
we all wanted to come.

928
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:27,887
Now, I look at is as kind of

929
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,422
a metaphor of how one can find

930
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,159
absolute happiness

931
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,461
with the least amount of stuff.

932
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,101
>> Like winds and sunsets,

933
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,370
wild things

934
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,603
were taken for granted

935
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:45,938
until progress

936
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,907
began to do away with them.

937
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,142
Now we face the question

938
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:50,377
whether a still

939
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:52,078
higher standard of living

940
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,546
is worth its costs

941
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,847
in things natural, wild

942
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,783
and free.

943
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,655
>> When Leopold came out to his

944
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,790
shack by the Wisconsin River,

945
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,892
there were no calls

946
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:07,160
of sandhill cranes.

947
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,294
He had to go deep

948
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,562
into the sand counties,

949
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:10,963
into the wilderness areas

950
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:12,131
to find the last few birds

951
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,300
that were left.

952
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,534
He estimated that there were

953
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,736
only about 100 cranes

954
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:18,370
in Wisconsin.

955
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,173
And the whooping crane

956
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:22,708
was practically extinct then.

957
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,877
He thought his "Marshland Elegy"

958
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,379
was an elegy

959
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,780
to the sandhill crane

960
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,882
that would soon disappear.

961
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:37,323
>> When we hear his call,

962
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,491
we hear no mere bird.

963
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,760
We hear the trumpet

964
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,961
in the orchestra

965
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,129
of evolution.

966
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,500
He is the symbol

967
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,870
of our untamable past,

968
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,671
of that incredible sweep

969
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,473
of millennia which underlies

970
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,042
and conditions

971
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,443
the daily affairs of birds

972
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,779
and men.

973
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:09,055
>> In the midst of the

974
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,623
Depression and the Dust Bowl,

975
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:11,891
Leopold was rethinking

976
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:14,327
our very idea of progress,

977
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:16,428
and how it affects the land.

978
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,069
>> The destruction of soil

979
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,603
is the most fundamental

980
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,639
kind of economic loss which

981
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,207
the human race can suffer.

982
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,580
>> The upper Midwest was

983
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,114
subject to massive soil erosion

984
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:38,550
and watershed degradation.

985
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,052
So Leopold and a team

986
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,754
of like-minded colleagues

987
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:43,323
pioneered a radical new approach

988
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,124
to conservation,

989
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,525
working with all the landowners

990
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,793
in a given watershed

991
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,829
to heal the land.

992
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,297
The first time they tried

993
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:53,199
this was in western Wisconsin,

994
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,501
in a place called Coon Valley.

995
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,308
Here in this little valley,

996
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,308
a revolution in conservation

997
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,378
began.

998
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,579
Hundreds of farmers joined the

999
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,581
effort, working with specialists

1000
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:10,916
in agriculture, soil, water,

1001
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,085
wildlife and forestry.

1002
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,320
With the newly enrolled

1003
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,488
young workers of the Civilian

1004
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,656
Conservation Corps, together

1005
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,892
they created the very first

1006
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,394
watershed scale conservation

1007
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:25,131
project in the nation.

1008
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,399
We tend to think of something as

1009
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,733
either public or it's private,

1010
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:28,767
and there's no overlap

1011
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:29,969
between them.

1012
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,003
>> Leopold started

1013
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,338
on the public land,

1014
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:33,539
the national forest lands,

1015
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,408
and so on.

1016
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,310
But then, he came to realize

1017
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,844
the importance after moving

1018
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,312
back to the Midwest, that

1019
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,148
there really was very little

1020
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:44,683
public land.

1021
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,118
In fact, most

1022
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:46,986
of the productive land

1023
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,021
from a biological standpoint

1024
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,723
is really on private lands

1025
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:52,525
and not on public lands.

1026
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,260
So, out of that came the idea

1027
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,728
that if we really are going

1028
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:57,230
to protect

1029
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,731
and preserve our environment,

1030
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,865
we would have to do it

1031
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:00,966
through private land

1032
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,403
and private land owners.

1033
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:04,570
>> Conservation

1034
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,838
will ultimately

1035
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,407
boil down to rewarding

1036
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:08,908
the private landowner who

1037
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:10,809
conserves the public interest.

1038
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,847
>> So, Leopold came in

1039
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:16,048
with the idea that we ought to

1040
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,116
have a beautiful landscape,

1041
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,217
not just a utilitarian

1042
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,253
landscape.

1043
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:21,688
He wrote back then

1044
00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:23,789
about conservation being harmony

1045
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,124
between people and land.

1046
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,426
And land to him

1047
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:27,793
was more than just soil.

1048
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,994
It also includes water,

1049
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,696
and wildlife, and plants,

1050
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:34,833
and humans.

1051
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,001
Just drive through Coon Valley

1052
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,103
today and see the beauty

1053
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:38,670
of the landscape.

1054
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,273
Through Leopold's ideas

1055
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,941
and many others who began

1056
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,976
back in 1933, we've been able

1057
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,711
to make that land

1058
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,780
much healthier again.

1059
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:51,884
>> In 1935, Leopold's interest

1060
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:53,453
in forestry and wildlife

1061
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:55,455
conservation drew him overseas

1062
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:57,756
for the only time in his life.

1063
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,125
On a trip to Germany, he got

1064
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,692
a firsthand look at intensive

1065
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,895
resource management.

1066
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,298
>> We Americans have not yet

1067
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,567
experienced a bear-less,

1068
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,568
wolf-less, eagle-less,

1069
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:12,037
cat-less woods.

1070
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:13,973
Germany strove for maximum

1071
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,075
yields of both timber

1072
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:18,209
and game, and got neither.

1073
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,847
>> Leopold's time in the forests

1074
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:22,982
of central Europe taught him

1075
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:24,583
a critical lesson.

1076
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,717
Germany had,

1077
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,119
over several centuries

1078
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,554
developed an artificial,

1079
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,055
highly intensive approach

1080
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,957
to forest and game management.

1081
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,526
But for Leopold,

1082
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:36,429
something crucial was missing.

1083
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:38,331
>> He made a trip in 1935

1084
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:40,132
to Germany, where he describes

1085
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,433
the slick, clean forests.

1086
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:44,837
One of the contrasts of that

1087
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,138
was his trip in 1936,

1088
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,207
and again in 1937,

1089
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,376
to the Rio Gavilan region

1090
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,777
of northern Mexico,

1091
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,145
a region that I have become

1092
00:36:53,145 --> 00:37:02,320
familiar with in my own work.

1093
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,089
This is a pretty wild,

1094
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,525
remote piece of country.

1095
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,159
I think it had a profound

1096
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,661
influence on Leopold.

1097
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,165
>> It was here that

1098
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,867
I first clearly realized

1099
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:17,203
that land is an organism,

1100
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:18,571
that all my life I had seen

1101
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:21,040
only sick land,

1102
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,741
whereas here was a biota

1103
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,109
still in perfect

1104
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,278
aboriginal health.

1105
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,913
The term

1106
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,848
"unspoiled wilderness"

1107
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,850
took on a new meaning.

1108
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,956
>> We are all Aldo Leopold's

1109
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,858
great-grandchildren

1110
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,694
intellectually,

1111
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,162
and I happen to be personally,

1112
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:45,398
as well.

1113
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:46,566
But he's pointed us

1114
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:48,033
down an important path.

1115
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,569
And we'll be going down

1116
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:50,670
that path and finding our way

1117
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,304
for some time, I suspect.

1118
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:56,308
That's a good thing.

1119
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,809
>> Leopold's travels led him

1120
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,078
to realize that wilderness

1121
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:00,979
must be protected,

1122
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,481
not just for its recreational

1123
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,183
and cultural values, but

1124
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:06,786
also for its scientific value.

1125
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,454
In his words, we need wilderness

1126
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,322
to serve as a land laboratory,

1127
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,057
a place to understand

1128
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:15,961
the land's ecological processes.

1129
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,229
During this period,

1130
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:18,631
Leopold joined forces with

1131
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,733
other leading conservationists

1132
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,635
to form the Wilderness Society,

1133
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:23,936
dedicated to protecting

1134
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,337
the wildest portions

1135
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,905
of the nation's public lands

1136
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,673
from rampant development.

1137
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:33,613
Eventually, the system

1138
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:34,614
of protected wilderness

1139
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:35,848
would embrace

1140
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:36,982
more than 100 million acres

1141
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,917
across the country.

1142
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:42,854
>> To those devoid

1143
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,390
of imagination

1144
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,658
a blank place on the map

1145
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,460
is a useless waste;

1146
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,694
to others,

1147
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,897
the most valuable part.

1148
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,501
>> While Leopold fought

1149
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,835
to protect the spectacular

1150
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,638
public wild lands,

1151
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:00,239
he was equally conscious

1152
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,007
of the need to restore wildness

1153
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,942
and land health close to home.

1154
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,117
>> What more

1155
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,419
delightful avocation

1156
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,321
than to take a piece of land

1157
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:16,522
and by cautious

1158
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,056
experimentation

1159
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,693
to prove how it works.

1160
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,194
What more substantial service

1161
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,696
to conservation

1162
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:24,997
than to practice it

1163
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:27,099
on one's own land?

1164
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,437
>> That first year,

1165
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:33,472
we began to plant pines and

1166
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:34,940
to bring it back to what it was

1167
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,543
originally.

1168
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,312
>> We planted 3,000 a year,

1169
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:41,881
so I think it was approximately

1170
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,248
48,000, something like that,

1171
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,184
all together.

1172
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,554
>> Acts of creation

1173
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,822
are ordinarily reserved

1174
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,024
for gods and poets,

1175
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:52,991
but humbler folk

1176
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,159
may circumvent

1177
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,327
this restriction

1178
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:56,996
if they know how.

1179
00:39:56,996 --> 00:39:58,364
To plant a pine, for example,

1180
00:39:58,364 --> 00:39:59,799
one need be

1181
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,967
neither god nor poet;

1182
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,669
one need only

1183
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:05,637
own a good shovel.

1184
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,308
>> Leopold's thinking

1185
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:10,542
is pertinent everywhere.

1186
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,478
It was very modern

1187
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,846
with regards of using science

1188
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,481
and the new emergent science

1189
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:17,316
of ecology

1190
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:18,818
for making decisions

1191
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:21,253
about managing the landscape.

1192
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,688
>> It took ecology

1193
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,924
to bring us back to this notion

1194
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,225
of communities, of things

1195
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:28,160
being deeply connected.

1196
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,396
Leopold was the key translator

1197
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,665
of that idea.

1198
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,867
>> I think today, Aldo Leopold's

1199
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:37,570
influence and his philosophies

1200
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,037
are more apparent,

1201
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,339
and more of a guiding factor

1202
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:41,473
in land management agencies

1203
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,675
than they've ever been.

1204
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:52,585
>> Our tools are better

1205
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:56,388
than we are.

1206
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,857
They suffice

1207
00:40:57,857 --> 00:40:59,391
to crack the atom,

1208
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:01,360
to command the tides,

1209
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,327
but they do not suffice

1210
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,129
for the oldest task

1211
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,766
in human history,

1212
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,634
to live on a piece of land

1213
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,902
without spoiling it.

1214
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:17,142
>> This is an area where wolves

1215
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,144
have been reintroduced.

1216
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:19,978
In an ongoing process,

1217
00:41:20,613 --> 00:41:21,914
there have been about 100 wolves

1218
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,916
reintroduced over the years,

1219
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,118
and about 52 at last count,

1220
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:27,820
occupying this country

1221
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,920
and the adjacent country

1222
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,188
over in New Mexico.

1223
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,390
We've got a ways to go

1224
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,024
in terms of building

1225
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,426
our wolf numbers up to

1226
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,228
what we refer to as

1227
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,763
ecologically effective

1228
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:51,643
population density.

1229
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,479
This population was down to

1230
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:54,814
seven wolves at one time.

1231
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:56,181
Every Mexican wolf

1232
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,215
that's alive today in captivity

1233
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,317
or the wild can be traced

1234
00:41:58,317 --> 00:41:59,652
back to seven animals,

1235
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:00,886
so they were teetering

1236
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:02,053
on the brink of extinction.

1237
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,156
It was nearly there.

1238
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,697
Starting when the wolves

1239
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:12,865
were taken out of that system,

1240
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:14,399
the aspens, willows and

1241
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,035
the cottonwoods just ceased

1242
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,003
to reproduce, because the elk

1243
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,205
increased in numbers.

1244
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,640
That's one of the roles

1245
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,043
of wolves in ecosystems, is to

1246
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:26,612
control the elk population.

1247
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,246
It's an amazing story

1248
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,349
of ecological regeneration.

1249
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,571
Wolf recovery, of course,

1250
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:53,905
is an extremely controversial

1251
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,075
topic.

1252
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,977
So we need to find new ways

1253
00:42:57,977 --> 00:43:00,245
to resolve conflict that leave

1254
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:04,249
more wolves on the ground.

1255
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,684
So we can get to that objective

1256
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,752
and help regenerate ecosystems.

1257
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,424
>> Conservation,

1258
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,125
without a keen realization

1259
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,627
of its vital conflicts,

1260
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,096
fails to rate

1261
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:19,464
as authentic human drama.

1262
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,766
It falls to the level

1263
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,668
of a mere utopian dream.

1264
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,972
>> Leopold understood that

1265
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:28,841
these are complicated issues.

1266
00:43:28,841 --> 00:43:30,176
He understood that

1267
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:32,210
there were no simple solutions.

1268
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,512
He himself contained

1269
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:35,247
so many different dimensions.

1270
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:36,715
He was a hunter.

1271
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:37,649
He was also a protector

1272
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,685
of wildlife.

1273
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:40,986
He was a forester

1274
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,287
who understood the need

1275
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,622
for "wise use" of timber,

1276
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,490
and other forest resources.

1277
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,825
But he was also

1278
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:47,960
one of the great champions

1279
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,929
of preserving wild lands.

1280
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,363
All the complex tensions

1281
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:52,564
that were built into

1282
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:53,966
the conservation movement

1283
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:58,236
were there inside Leopold.

1284
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,538
>> The amazing thing

1285
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:00,739
is that we could almost be

1286
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,307
seeing a wolf here any time,

1287
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,943
because they're back.

1288
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:04,910
>> And they are nearby,

1289
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,311
aren't they?

1290
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,646
>> Yes, they are.

1291
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,514
There is a pack

1292
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:11,249
about five miles from here.

1293
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,651
That's close in wolf terms.

1294
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:14,018
That means they could be

1295
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,220
anywhere near us

1296
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,288
at this point in time.

1297
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,522
>> We may never know

1298
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,058
exactly where the wolf

1299
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:20,392
shooting incident happened,

1300
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,393
but we can feel pretty confident

1301
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,095
that it was very close

1302
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,596
to where we're standing.

1303
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,531
For the record, it's almost

1304
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:29,101
exactly 100 years ago to the day

1305
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,170
that the incident happened here.

1306
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,704
>> That's correct, in September.

1307
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,106
>> So he and his ranger,

1308
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:36,242
Mr. Wheatley, are both shooting,

1309
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:38,376
presumably, we don't know which

1310
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,212
fatal shots may have been whose.

1311
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:41,780
But the wolves are wounded,

1312
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,415
a couple are down.

1313
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:44,750
The ones that are surviving

1314
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,485
begin clawing their way back

1315
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:48,119
into the talus slopes,

1316
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,454
Leopold comes up to

1317
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,623
the mother wolf, and sees

1318
00:44:51,623 --> 00:45:01,199
the green fire die right here.

1319
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:02,901
>> We reached the old wolf

1320
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,302
in time to watch

1321
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,804
a fierce green fire

1322
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,239
dying in her eyes.

1323
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,842
I realized then

1324
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:11,944
and have known ever since

1325
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:13,179
that there was something

1326
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,713
new to me in those eyes,

1327
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,748
something known only to her

1328
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,617
and to the mountain.

1329
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:20,719
I was young then

1330
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,988
and full of trigger-itch;

1331
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,690
I thought that because

1332
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,725
fewer wolves meant more deer,

1333
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,393
that no wolves

1334
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,729
would mean hunters' paradise.

1335
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:31,830
But after seeing

1336
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,099
the green fire die,

1337
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,400
I sensed that neither

1338
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,402
the wolf nor the mountain

1339
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,504
agreed with such a view.

1340
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:46,712
>> In that one essay,

1341
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:48,113
that one moment

1342
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:49,514
when he saw the green fire,

1343
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,516
that was a transformational

1344
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,719
moment in his individual life.

1345
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,721
It also suggests the

1346
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:57,323
transformational moment in our

1347
00:45:57,323 --> 00:45:58,857
movement, if we're willing to

1348
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:02,027
change ourselves.

1349
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:04,830
>> You know, we all have

1350
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,266
the essence

1351
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:09,768
of the fierce green fire.

1352
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,036
That's again,

1353
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:21,379
our hope, I think.

1354
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,314
>> The fierce green fire

1355
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,583
Leopold saw in the eyes

1356
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,252
of the dying wolf

1357
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:27,886
would come over his lifetime

1358
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:29,221
to signify far more

1359
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:31,257
than one creature's passing

1360
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:35,261
or one person's experience.

1361
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:37,662
Remembering that fateful moment,

1362
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:39,098
Leopold bore witness to the

1363
00:46:39,098 --> 00:46:41,200
deep history of the mountain,

1364
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,601
the fullness of its community

1365
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:44,803
of life, the complicated

1366
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:45,871
and changing role of people

1367
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:49,741
within it.

1368
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,776
For Leopold, the encounter

1369
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:52,111
with the wolf

1370
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:53,578
was an early turning point

1371
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:55,614
on his own trail.

1372
00:46:55,614 --> 00:46:56,815
He followed that trail

1373
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,218
until it led to the Land Ethic.

1374
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:02,287
Finally, in the summer of 1947,

1375
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:03,822
he sat down to distill

1376
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:07,058
his thoughts.

1377
00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:11,463
>> Examine each question

1378
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,098
in terms of what is ethically

1379
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:15,234
and aesthetically right,

1380
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:16,468
as well as what is

1381
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:18,804
economically expedient.

1382
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:20,205
A thing is right

1383
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,873
when it tends to preserve

1384
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:23,675
the integrity, stability,

1385
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:25,110
and beauty

1386
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,611
of the biotic community.

1387
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:27,846
It is wrong

1388
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,848
when it tends otherwise.

1389
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:34,586
>> The Land Ethic was

1390
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:36,822
the end result of a long process

1391
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:39,524
of experience and reflection.

1392
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,926
In many ways, it was the

1393
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:44,529
culmination of his life journey.

1394
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,497
These are Leopold's

1395
00:47:45,497 --> 00:47:47,232
field journals.

1396
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,268
He began them in 1917, when he

1397
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:50,535
was still in the Forest Service

1398
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,671
and living in the Southwest.

1399
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:53,404
These aren't his professional

1400
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,174
journals.

1401
00:47:55,174 --> 00:47:56,208
These are his more personal

1402
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,275
records of his own time

1403
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,477
in the outdoors.

1404
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,779
And almost any time Leopold

1405
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:02,480
was outside, the next thing

1406
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,615
he would do was come home

1407
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,450
and write about it.

1408
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,417
On any given day, he'd note

1409
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,387
the weather, what he saw,

1410
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:10,221
phenology, first and last blooms

1411
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,257
of flowers.

1412
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:14,326
This is just two nights before

1413
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,661
he would pass away, actually.

1414
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,263
In fact, over here we have

1415
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:19,464
things that were on him when

1416
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:20,866
he suffered the heart attack

1417
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:22,267
that killed him

1418
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:23,468
while he was fighting a fire.

1419
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,769
This is actually materials

1420
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,372
that were in his pocket that

1421
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:28,907
were singed during the fire.

1422
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:29,841
This is actually the final entry

1423
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:31,210
in Aldo Leopold's

1424
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,677
field journals.

1425
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:35,714
April 21, 1948.

1426
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:37,615
Bloodroot in Shower Bed,

1427
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,718
Closed, 6:00am.

1428
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,058
>> My father was at the shack

1429
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:48,126
with mother, always.

1430
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:50,162
My younger sister, Estella,

1431
00:48:50,162 --> 00:48:52,731
she was about 15 years old then.

1432
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:54,499
>> So, that week,

1433
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:55,834
we got all packed up,

1434
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:56,801
just mother and dad and I

1435
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:57,903
went up to the shack

1436
00:48:57,903 --> 00:48:59,303
to plant pines.

1437
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:01,306
And of course,

1438
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:02,941
that was the very week

1439
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:04,809
when the neighbor's fire

1440
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:08,213
was a calamity for us.

1441
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:09,848
>> The farmer adjacent to us

1442
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:12,184
was burning brush.

1443
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:14,386
The fire got away from him.

1444
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:16,455
So dad and mother and Estella

1445
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:18,023
decided they would go and help

1446
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:20,458
this farmer fight the fire.

1447
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,261
Each one went

1448
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:24,529
in a different direction.

1449
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,465
All of a sudden,

1450
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:29,368
I guess the fire was out,

1451
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:33,038
but dad was nowhere to be seen.

1452
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:35,374
>> I went out into the marsh.

1453
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:36,741
I saw a man coming down

1454
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:40,045
the hill, coming toward me.

1455
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,747
I had this sinking feeling.

1456
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:44,249
He came all the way across the

1457
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:46,051
marsh, and when he got to me,

1458
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:47,685
I said, "Something's wrong."

1459
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,154
And he said,

1460
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,789
"Yes, your father's sick."

1461
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:51,823
I said, "It's worse than that,

1462
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,558
isn't it?"

1463
00:49:53,558 --> 00:50:30,394
I just knew.

1464
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:32,030
>> We reached the old wolf

1465
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,298
in time to watch

1466
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:34,866
a fierce green fire

1467
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,467
dying in her eyes.

1468
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,702
I realized then

1469
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,204
and have known ever since

1470
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,705
that there was something

1471
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,440
new to me in those eyes...

1472
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,710
>> It was fortuitous, indeed,

1473
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,379
that the same week

1474
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,747
that dad died, he heard from

1475
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:52,050
Oxford University Press that

1476
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,287
they would publish his essay.

1477
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:56,587
>> After several rejections,

1478
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:57,722
"A Sand County Almanac"

1479
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,324
was finally published.

1480
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:00,959
At first, it sold modestly.

1481
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,561
It took decades for it to become

1482
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:03,995
as some would say, "the Bible

1483
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:05,797
of the environmental movement."

1484
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:07,032
It would sell in the millions.

1485
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,900
>> His writing was so deep,

1486
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,669
and so layered,

1487
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:11,936
that you can find something new

1488
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,771
each time you pick it up.

1489
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,374
>> Now I read it at least

1490
00:51:15,374 --> 00:51:16,875
once a year on my birthday,

1491
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,477
just to see what I've learned.

1492
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:20,011
>> Even in Russian, it's,

1493
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:21,646
you feel the poetry.

1494
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,348
>> That book is an absolute

1495
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:25,683
masterpiece.

1496
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:28,786
It's so simple,

1497
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:30,555
but that's only the

1498
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,290
construction,

1499
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,591
because the thinking behind it

1500
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,027
is so, so deep.

1501
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:37,162
>> I had the pleasure

1502
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:38,397
of reading this book,

1503
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:39,697
"A Sand County Almanac,"

1504
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,500
about 25 years ago.

1505
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,767
I'm pleased to be with you

1506
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,236
this morning.

1507
00:51:44,236 --> 00:51:45,237
Thank you for the honor.

1508
00:51:45,237 --> 00:51:46,104
We're going to share the reading

1509
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:47,639
of "February."

1510
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,408
If one has cut, split, hauled,

1511
00:51:49,408 --> 00:51:51,677
and piled his own good oak, and

1512
00:51:51,677 --> 00:51:57,314
let his mind work the while...

1513
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,586
>> I remember one day I was at

1514
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:03,589
the shack with Estella Leopold

1515
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:05,223
and her mother on Easter Sunday,

1516
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:08,492
1969.

1517
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,128
We heard a sound

1518
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,029
that was unlike anything

1519
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:12,698
I had ever heard.

1520
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:15,800
It was an extraordinary thrill.

1521
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,536
You know, I had never heard

1522
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:19,904
that sound before in my life.

1523
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:22,006
But somehow, I had heard it

1524
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,276
in my imagination, because

1525
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:26,511
Leopold had described it

1526
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,980
as this primordial bugling.

1527
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,548
The sandhill cranes

1528
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,016
had come back

1529
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:35,686
to Aldo Leopold's marsh.

1530
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,255
>> Our ability

1531
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:38,923
to perceive quality in nature

1532
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:40,725
begins, as in art,

1533
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:43,861
with the pretty.

1534
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,263
It expands

1535
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,531
through successive stages

1536
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,099
of the beautiful

1537
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,001
to values as yet uncaptured

1538
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,971
by language.

1539
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:54,839
The quality of cranes

1540
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,408
lies, I think,

1541
00:52:56,408 --> 00:52:58,644
in this higher gamut,

1542
00:52:58,644 --> 00:52:59,978
as yet beyond the reach

1543
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:01,779
of words.

1544
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,522
>> Thanks to Leopold, and to

1545
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:11,589
so many who have followed him,

1546
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,291
sandhill cranes

1547
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,726
have rebounded dramatically.

1548
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:16,894
Although we face daunting

1549
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,463
threats to nature's diversity

1550
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,298
worldwide, the cranes

1551
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:22,066
demonstrate and symbolize

1552
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:23,935
our ability to work together

1553
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:25,136
for the health of the land

1554
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:27,205
and its creatures.

1555
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:41,719
Leopold's legacy endures,

1556
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,021
because he is asking

1557
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:44,422
the fundamental questions of

1558
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,424
our relationship to the earth,

1559
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,792
to other forms of life,

1560
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:48,960
to the communities

1561
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,698
in which we live.

1562
00:53:52,698 --> 00:53:54,799
>> There's been a rediscovery

1563
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:56,801
of Leopold's significance

1564
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,136
for community-based

1565
00:53:58,136 --> 00:54:00,171
conservation.

1566
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,506
More than a million

1567
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,642
organizations all over the world

1568
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:06,144
are working on some aspect

1569
00:54:06,144 --> 00:54:08,179
of conservation and restoration

1570
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:11,483
of the environment.

1571
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:13,719
This, I've come to believe,

1572
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,653
is a veritable green fire

1573
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,788
of conservation

1574
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,790
and ecosystem restoration.

1575
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,060
That, I think,

1576
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:26,497
is Aldo Leopold's living legacy.

1577
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:29,701
>> Leopold said that the oldest

1578
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:31,802
task in human history is perhaps

1579
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,238
to live on a piece of land

1580
00:54:33,238 --> 00:54:36,007
without spoiling it.

1581
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:37,242
Certainly, my generation

1582
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:38,776
is no better

1583
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,145
than the one before us.

1584
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:42,748
But I think there's a lot

1585
00:54:42,748 --> 00:54:44,482
of hope in the land ethic.

1586
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:45,983
A land ethic

1587
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:47,785
is not meant to be a last word.

1588
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,288
It's not meant to be doctoring.

1589
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,223
It's really a guiding light

1590
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:53,825
for the way

1591
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:56,928
we can find our way forward.

1592
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:58,764
>> If you read "The Land Ethic,"

1593
00:54:58,764 --> 00:54:59,964
you'll see what I like to call

1594
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:00,898
Leopold's most important

1595
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,233
sentence.

1596
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:03,435
Toward the end of

1597
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:04,402
"The Land Ethic," he has

1598
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:05,403
a sentence that says,

1599
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:06,504
"Nothing so important

1600
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:07,739
as an ethic is ever written.

1601
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:08,873
It evolves in the minds

1602
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:11,075
of a thinking community."

1603
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,143
So here he is, in his essay,

1604
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,645
"The Land Ethic," saying

1605
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:17,181
no one writes the land ethic.

1606
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,117
I think it's a stroke of genius,

1607
00:55:19,117 --> 00:55:20,151
maybe his greatest stroke of

1608
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,453
genius, because with that,

1609
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:23,054
he liberates the idea.

1610
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:24,289
He opens it to the larger

1611
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:25,790
thinking community.

1612
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,025
Us.

1613
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:33,965
>> I have purposely presented

1614
00:55:33,965 --> 00:55:35,734
the land ethic as a product

1615
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:37,869
of social evolution,

1616
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:39,571
because nothing so important

1617
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:42,240
as an ethic is ever written.

1618
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,375
It evolves in the minds

1619
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,711
of a thinking community.

1620
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:56,654
