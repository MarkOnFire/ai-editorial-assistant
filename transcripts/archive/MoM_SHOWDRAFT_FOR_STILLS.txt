The listening room venue for us is perfect. We're a mellow, like, folk band and, with some intricate harmonies. So having a listening room with a really attentive, audience is really cool for us.

00:14:24:10 - 00:14:27:11

00:15:03:14 - 00:15:35:05

To be silent in a room and listen to, like, every word you're saying is amazing. It's like every songwriters dream. And it's just an honor to have people listen to what I'm saying. It's amazing. I always knew you loved out East more than you'd ever love me. So I'm glad we never tried. Different coasts in opposite directions.

00:15:35:07 - 00:15:36:14

Speaker 1
Then I'm the kind of girl your parents want you up. I wish I could hold a steady job like I do. Love. And I swear sometimes I feel like I could drown. The thought of settling down. Like every other good girl does. But you still love me. When push comes to shove. And I pinch myself every day.

00:17:14:16 - 00:17:18:12

Speaker 1
Just the same.

00:18:37:03 - 00:18:53:09
Speaker 1
Yeah.

00:18:53:11 - 00:19:21:13
Speaker 4
Participants that come and want to watch one of the artists at the mile also have a chance to come and get involved in 40 to 50 hands on events that mile of music does every year for the education portion, creating their own pieces of music which allow them to discover their own birthright of music. Make it happen. That would just break with that way.

00:19:21:16 - 00:20:00:23
Speaker 4
The Music Education team has been amazing. You need to have young musicians and inspire creatives, young and old. An education in music means really just a community coming together around joy. When you can just hit a drum one time that you've been a part of how the soundscape of the mile of music has played out for that year, and that kind of gives people who attend the mile a little bit of a chance to understand, like why music making might be important to the artists because they felt what it was like to make music and make music in community.

00:20:01:01 - 00:20:23:15
Speaker 1
Okay, nice to hear you're selling in your first song.

Standing in stone. My soul like an invalid. I'll continue to figure out all the living it is. Live in the scene. It's closer than I remember now. But the brew is forming in the room. That means that I am taller than the roof. They let me. I just shoot something loose. But take a look at this floor.

00:21:00:02 - 00:21:30:11
Unknown
I've been making it for the day. Now the tea with my mind. And I've been making it day with my. I was. Making.

00:21:30:12 - 00:21:36:08

One of the great strengths of downtown Appleton is its walkability, and the feeling of being able to move from a shop to a restaurant to a bar, to an outside space.

00:25:50:20 - 00:25:54:11
Speaker 5
Anything is a venue. Anything and everywhere is a venue.

00:25:54:13 - 00:26:27:06
Speaker 2
I just like, go downtown at like 10 a.m. and start walking around. Maybe it's not like the spot usually you would go to. You're like, we're here behind like a bar and just hanging out. And they let it go like people from all walks of life doesn't know where you're from, I guess. Let it go head bang a bit, bounce a bit, have a good time.

00:26:27:07 - 00:27:04:12
Unknown
Don't be afraid to ask for more. It's not a rocker like before. Pushing up on it. That feels right. I'm not coming for the fight. If you're walking in my shoes, just be prepared. I don't want you. I still fall in love with my staff. Keep it in mind. This ones are side. One for the road. When? When we're done.

00:27:04:14 - 00:28:00:21
Unknown
Never alone on swear your friends are you beside you. Swear. Blessed by love. How will you know if I leave it I'm sad. Oh, it's just how it goes. Oh, this life that we chose was oh so long. With the show.

00:28:00:23 - 00:28:21:21
Speaker 2
I think the variety of venues is. It's one of the things that makes the festival unique. But I think it's also one of the things that helps create the atmosphere of like discovery, because you might be seeing someone you've never heard before in a place that's never even hosted a show before, with people who've also never heard this band or this artist no longer blinks.

00:28:21:21 - 00:28:54:09
Speaker 1
But I'm still not sleeping. I found a lot of holes, but I dug no graves here. Us in the water. Where is so sweetly? Laid down in the sand of the riverbed. I made a run just a dollar to my name. Hoping someday I could turn it into ten.

00:28:54:11 - 00:29:09:23
Speaker 1
I found each place that I came across was just the same. Familiar faces chased me. They just had different names.

00:29:10:01 - 00:29:45:05
Speaker 1
Then fear became. The name I gave my faith. That faith gave me a way. Their fear became the name I gave my faith. That faith gave me a way. Made a run just a dollar to my name. Hoping someday I could turn it in to ten.

00:29:45:07 - 00:29:59:08
Speaker 1
I found each place that I came across was just the same. Familiar faces chased me. They just had different names.

00:29:59:10 - 00:30:28:00
Speaker 7
So from a fan's perspective, it's just really the ability to come to our downtown and then just go into venues. And if you don't like something, you can go right next door, but there's definitely going to be something you're going to like. I think we guarantee it. This festival generates music that is for everyone, for all members of the community, for thank you.

00:30:28:02 - 00:30:47:16
Speaker 1
Listen, it's a simple snare, simple kick, a simple hat I'm singing for I'm never born. I really rap good. Solid boy. Take it. Queen is Carson. Never take your twisted. Probably wrong. Let's call you Chubby Checker. The novel. Super marvelous. He is. Now return, I tell you. With the ashes leave you in the air. They put me can get the dishes so but dominated.

You let it just kind of walk from Jones Park to Whodini Plaza and down to Lawrence. She kind of hit that loop. If you don't like the band, then we move on. If we like, can we set.

Unknown
Up government House for, well, let me say.

00:31:22:04 - 00:31:51:17
Speaker 2
I think a fairly accurate description of the, musical walk in the park. You know, everyone just kind of congregates and just casually goes from place to place, check out a band for 20 minutes, and then 30 minutes walk to the next one. It's so fun to try to figure out how to cram as much music as you can into into four days and then realize that your schedule is going to fall apart somewhere and and it's going to lead you into or the festival will lead you into something absolutely amazing.

00:31:51:19 - 00:31:58:08
Speaker 2
It happens every year. I mean.

00:31:58:10 - 00:32:10:08

Meal music is very artist focused and community forward. We pride ourselves on taking care of the artists 100% from the time we initially made contact with them all the way through till when they leave.

00:35:36:05 - 00:36:01:14
Speaker 2
From the the moment we booked it to getting on site, we feel really taken care of. The logistics are super smooth and easy. There's, a sign up sheet for a free massage. There's amazing food ready for us anytime we wanted it. It's a pretty prime place to be. There's an artist care program here that includes things ranging from dental care to chiropractic care, to massages to tons of free food.

00:36:01:16 - 00:36:11:02
Speaker 2
Getting some hearing tests, and even being able to get your haircut. Those are things that you just never really have access to at a lot of festivals.

00:36:11:07 - 00:36:11:12

We.

Speaker 2
We're playing with house money tonight, baby.

00:36:27:23 - 00:36:42:04
Speaker 5
I'd say we felt we feel very appreciated here. That's what I had heard about the festival before. That's all I heard about it was free health care. A friend who was here was like, oh man, you can get a massage and your eyes checked in, your ears getting custom ear plugs. I'm like, oh, that sounds.

00:36:42:04 - 00:36:43:19

This game ain't no way to win. To help me to believe when I'm falling again. Cause you got away with words.

00:38:21:03 - 00:38:32:09
Speaker 2
Being on the road for a long time. Like you have. Like you have good nights and bad nights. It's like, you know, 5050. But like coming to a festival like this, like, every night seems to kind of be like this, like a a treasure.

00:38:32:11 - 00:38:42:02

Speaker 1
No, you're just being be. You can't turn the other cheek.

00:39:53:04 - 00:40:04:01
Speaker 1
Looking at the stars on some face. Thought it was the Mona Lisa.

00:40:04:03 - 00:40:05:07

Looking at the.

00:40:05:07 - 00:40:14:23

Speaker 1
See?

00:40:24:08 - 00:40:42:10
Speaker 2
It's like every audience. There's going to be a couple people who know us. But a lot of it is new people. A lot of it are people who had just heard that we're cool, man to see. Or a friend said, go check these these guys out or whatever. And, we definitely come from a perspective. If we want to win every audience over, every show really, really matters to us.

00:40:42:12 - 00:41:22:07
Speaker 2
And to, like, watch the faces of people who were seeing us for the first time, kind of light up throughout the show is really a special thing.

00:41:22:09 - 00:41:58:15
Unknown
For the whole. You brother has to stop for me, don't you, Sky, give me one good reason why one lives and one man dies carrying his body broken home like it was that night. For the other man. I'm never gonna die. But I will never break the blood. No, no. Okay.

00:41:58:17 - 00:41:59:11

We have a very.

00:41:59:11 - 00:42:00:16
Speaker 1
Unique.

00:42:00:17 - 00:42:18:19
Speaker 2
Performance style. I'm playing a synthesizer with my feet, and then I'm playing guitar and singing and really jumping around stage as much as I can. And then, of course, Jake is standing out while he's playing drums, and he's at the front of the stage with me. We're fully right on top of the audience.

00:42:18:21 - 00:42:58:10
Unknown
Hey, Sean, I'm coming for you. Your name is in the lead up now, I. Hey, no, I'm coming for your running. Man, I said I, I will never play his brother. He's gonna keep an eye.

00:42:58:12 - 00:43:10:18
Unknown
And we feel. You hear me? All right.

00:43:10:20 - 00:43:36:10
Speaker 4
Musicians are our voice, our communication, our presentation to the world. And so I think musicians and art in general, all creatives help those of us who need a little bit more help in our expression, feel connected.

00:43:36:12 - 00:43:50:16
Speaker 7
I think what we do well here on music is we do allow that fan engagement. It's all part of our identity. And again, these artists as developing artists, emerging artists, they want to have access to the fans, to greet the fans at the merch table.

00:43:50:21 - 00:43:52:08
Speaker 1
You guys just.

00:43:52:10 - 00:43:59:06
Speaker 7
Fans love the idea of being able to walk down the street and see the artists walking by them, and strike up a conversation with them.

00:43:59:09 - 00:43:59:23
Speaker 1
It's a sure.

00:44:00:04 - 00:44:01:08
Speaker 4
Sign.

00:44:01:10 - 00:44:04:03
Speaker 1
That.

00:44:04:05 - 00:44:23:01
Speaker 4
Meeting all these fans and being able to connect after the show, and they care and they show up even if they don't know who you are. So everyone has honestly just shown up with nothing but kindness and compassion and genuine curiosity and care for music. You guys just absolutely, you're my happy place. And oh.

00:44:23:03 - 00:44:24:16
Speaker 2
Thank you so much that people are.

00:44:24:16 - 00:44:43:07
Speaker 5
Extremely friendly and supportive. And considering this is entirely original music all week, and the fact that people are just here to listen to what we do and make is is amazing. Everybody treated us with such, such a level of respect. They have such a different way. Appreciation for music, I think, which you don't necessarily get everywhere that you play.

00:44:43:09 - 00:45:04:17
Speaker 5
Hamilton was, kind of get a vibe of the town, and, you know, all the people and people are recognizing us all over the place, which is kind of fun. And, it's it's a different audiences are lot more engaged in some festivals. They really want to listen to the music through there to party also. But the ratio of party to listen to music is a little, little higher on music side than some festivals.

00:45:04:19 - 00:45:26:02
Unknown
You wish I could make. Hey, stop!

00:45:26:04 - 00:46:02:15

00:46:02:17 - 00:46:22:23
Speaker 5
Me. And I feel like anywhere we go, we always kind of get to surprise people with what we're doing. Since we're kind of, like, a very unique sound. And, you know, not a lot of people play banjo in the way that I do. And Josiah, you know, and his drums and modular synthesizer set up, you know, we have we make a lot of noise for two people and try to keep it fun.

00:46:22:23 - 00:46:42:20
Speaker 5
And, you know, we can bring some, some joy to some folks out there and, just have a good time.

00:46:42:22 - 00:47:01:07

From.

00:50:45:13 - 00:51:03:01
Speaker 4
The way that the community has bought into this festival is what makes us what we are. And I think there's that sense of pride and ownership in developing mild music into what it has become.

00:51:03:03 - 00:51:18:12
Speaker 6
We have about 650 volunteers each year. We also have community sponsors to help keep it a free festival, and I think that's a really big, important reflection of Appleton.

00:51:18:14 - 00:51:31:20
Speaker 8
For artists to come here to, to want to make their way here, we have to be that beacon. We have to be that oasis where they say, oh, we have to stop in Appleton on our tour. We have to get to Appleton for a mile in music.

00:51:31:22 - 00:51:43:23
Speaker 4
Music is connection, and this is an experience that we have all, all of us, the entire community has curated to welcome creatives and music lovers.

00:51:44:01 - 00:51:58:05
Speaker 7
That's the power of live music. It brings us all together. It transcends us and genuinely makes us happier and better people.
