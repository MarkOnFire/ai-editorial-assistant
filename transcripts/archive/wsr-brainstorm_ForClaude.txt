[playful music]

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,176
- Kai: We're going to brainstorm
all the elements of a story.

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:12,246
Setting, characters, and plot.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,949
Remember, every idea
is a good idea.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,685
And every idea can be revised.

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,256
We're going to brainstorm
where the story takes place,

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,959
who is in the story, and what
even happens in the story.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,897
We want lots of options, and we
can always change it later.

9
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,233
Follow along with us and then
try it with your classmates.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,436
? Brainstorming, we're gonna
start brainstorming ?

11
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,138
ideas for a story.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,674
We're going to start
with settings.

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,545
Let's imagine other places
we would wanna go

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,413
and live and visit.

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,686
- 1996 New York.
- New York City, 1996.

16
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,423
- Yes.
- And it's light,

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,425
light, and it's light in space.

18
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,794
- Kai: Light in space.
- Sheperd: Light in space.

19
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,496
It's light, like how these
are lights,

20
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,631
or like it's lightweight
in space?

21
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,268
- Um, it's um, like,
it's like the outside.

22
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,603
And the stars are black.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,140
- Oh, and the stars are, oh!
- Group: Oh!

24
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,642
- Kai: Reverse, okay.
- Uh-huh, I like it.

25
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,745
Hildy.
- There's, like, a pizza place,

26
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:23,717
but instead of Papa John's,
it's Mama, um, Jolene's.

27
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,620
[all laughing]

28
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,723
- Mama Jolene's Pizza!
- Yeah.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,526
- Sheperd: Even better
ingredients, even better pizza,

30
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,695
Mama Jolene's.
- Mama Jolene's.

31
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,099
- Before we get started,
I want to challenge you

32
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,569
to come up
with original characters.

33
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,671
Do we know what original means?
- Group: Yes.

34
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,673
- Yes, it means it comes
from our own brains

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,841
and not something else.

36
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,009
Is SpongeBob
an original character,

37
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,210
if I said my character's
SpongeBob?

38
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,612
- Group: No!
- What about SqueegeeOb?

39
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,747
- Is SqueegeeOb
an original character?

40
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,916
- Group: Yeah!
- Oh, brilliant, excellent.

41
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,684
All right,
now I wanna see hands.

42
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,419
- Corbin, can you start us off,
please?

43
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,755
- Um, like a water
and a fire dude?

44
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,156
- Sheperd: [gasps]
A water and a--

45
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,558
like at the same time?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,159
- Sheperd: Like he's water
and fire dude?

47
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,095
- Yeah.
- Sheperd: Ooh, steamy.

48
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,397
- It's a tree named Jeffrey

49
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,768
who, by night, becomes a bush
who can shoot thorns.

50
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,737
- A dryad gone crazy.

51
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,706
- They're long-lost twins.

52
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,342
Their names and Dez and Zed.

53
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,244
- How'd they get lost?

54
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,879
- They're originally both born
on Jupiter,

55
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,649
but then they both climbed
into escape pods

56
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,518
to different planets.
- Whoa!

57
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,887
- Kai: Next is plot.

58
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,191
What happens in these stories?

59
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,692
Yes, please, start us off.

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,261
- There's this place called
Mama Jolene's Pizza,

61
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,897
and then this hooded guy
walks in.

62
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,234
- Thorin should be, like,
the bad guy in that.

63
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,236
- Dawry: Okay, okay.
- Kai: Yeah, so we have,

64
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,672
Once upon a time
at Mama Jolene's Pizza

65
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:57,244
in reverse space, Thorin the
dryad walks in, a cloak, period.

66
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,147
Every day.

67
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,317
What does Thorin do every day
at Mama Jolene's?

68
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,054
- Uh, he orders, uh, a Big Mac.
- Kai: Yes.

69
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,023
- I was just gonna say that!
[laughing]

70
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,259
- Kai: I...incredible.

71
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,628
- One day, like, the cloaked
guy, like,

72
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,831
doesn't wanna be evil anymore,
or something like that?

73
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,835
But, like, no one, like, knows
that he doesn't wanna be evil,

74
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,338
so they still all think that
he's evil.

75
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,073
- And because of that,

76
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,610
Dez goes to Mama Jolene's
Pizza Place

77
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,481
and sees a cloaked person
and gets scared.

78
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:39,586
- Maybe because of that, Thorin
chases them, saying,

79
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,421
"I'm not evil, I'm not evil!"

80
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,691
- Maybe to end out the story,
maybe it should say, like,

81
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,828
"Ever since that day,
they stopped being evil,

82
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,098
and create the froyo pizza
together."

83
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,766
- Kai: Yes, nailed it!

84
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,168
And then there's probably
gonna be more,

85
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,239
so let's just end it with,
- In unison: To be continued!

86
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,778
- Kai: All right, places!

87
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,614
Action.

88
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,350
- Once upon a time,
at Mama Jolene's Pizza

89
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,054
in reverse space,
Thorin the dryad walks in

90
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,789
in a dark cloak.

91
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,660
Every day, Thorin orders
a Big Mac.

92
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,629
Next door, in the froyo place,

93
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,899
Jeff the tree,
also known as Jefftree,

94
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,901
eats froyo with Percy Jackson,

95
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,338
who is secretly enemies
with Thorin.

96
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,741
One day, Thorin decides
not to be evil anymore.

97
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,877
But no one knows that.

98
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,414
Because of that,
Dez goes into MJ's,

99
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,152
also known as Mama Jolene's,
and sees Thorin, gets scared,

100
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,555
and runs into the froyo
and sees Zed,

101
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,191
her long-lost twin!

102
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,329
[all laughing]

103
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,667
Because of that,
Thorin chases them, saying,

104
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,402
- "I'm not evil!"

105
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,242
- And they all apologized
to Thorin and start being nice.

106
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,643
Ever since that day,

107
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,845
they decide to stop competing
at being evil

108
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,615
and create froyo pizza together.

109
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,350
To be continued.

110
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,319
- Kai: Yes.
[applauding]

111
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,190
[group chatting]
No, it's beautiful.
