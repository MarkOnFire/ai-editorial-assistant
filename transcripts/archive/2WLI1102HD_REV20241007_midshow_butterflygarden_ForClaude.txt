- I'm gliding through the
Butterfly Gardens of Wisconsin,

3
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:07,417
discovering the importance
of pollinators and native plants

4
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,250
to our state.

5
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:13,834
I first landed at the entrance
of the butterfly maze

6
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:15,999
to chat with Co-Founder
Marty Voight

7
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,041
about how this
enchanting property came to be.

8
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,125
- Marty Voight:
When we first bought
this property in the '80s,

9
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:27,000
we were going to use it
for botanical gardens,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,709
and the site assessor
looked at it

11
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:33,041
and told us that we had 16
different types of butterflies

12
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,999
that he saw
at that moment.

13
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,250
They would not exist here
anymore

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,999
if we had
a botanical gardens,

15
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:39,999
so then he decided

16
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,999
that we would turn it
into a butterfly gardens.

17
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:46,959
- Angela:
So, really honoring the species
that was already here?

18
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:47,375
- Yes.

19
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,208
- Helping them to stay
versus displacing.

20
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:54,000
- Well, we also have
50 different species of plants.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,583
To me, the most important part
about the gardens

22
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,875
is that people realize

23
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,999
that birds, bees, butterflies,
and bats-- but mostly bees--

24
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,375
create over a third
of the food we eat.

25
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,667
So, it's important
to keep the population up

26
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,999
and to keep them healthy.

27

- Angela: Thank you for sharing.

28
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:13,834
I did not realize
how much bees contributed

29
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,333
to so many things
that we appreciate.

30

very, very important.
