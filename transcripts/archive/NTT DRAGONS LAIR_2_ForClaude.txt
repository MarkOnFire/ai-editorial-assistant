00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,033
If you
visited an arcade sometime in the 1980s,

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,666
there's a good chance that this game 
took a decent chunk of your quarters.

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,266
Dragon's Lair!

4
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:10,366
Dragon's Lair was 
big news at the time.

5
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,600
So big that it was covered
in the very first episode of 

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Wisconsin Public Television’s show 

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,166
The New Tech Times,
a video magazine for the electronic age.

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,433
just a few months after the game's
1983 release.

9
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,666
What was the big deal?

10
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,800
Well, most arcade games at the time
looked like this,

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,966
whereas Dragon's Lair used Hollywood 
style animations for its visuals.

12
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,800
It did this
thanks in large part to

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,833
The LaserDisc.

14
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,033
It uses a light beam to produce
pictures on a TV screen

15
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:39,233
Dragon's Lair was a hit with 
players and critics

16
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:44,133
despite costing 50 cents—twice
as much as a normal arcade game.

17
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,800
And it certainly left
its mark on video game history,

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,866
although it didn't have quite the impact
that animator Don Bluth was predicting.

19
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:53,866
There'll be a whole barrage now of 
games which will start using

20
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,566
photographic visuals.

21
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,700
That did not happen.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,233
Fully animated arcade games
were pretty short lived as a phenomenon.

23
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,933
So did you lose quarters attempting
to save Princess Daphne 

24
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:04,933
from the dragon Singe?

25
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:08,133
I know I did, and I barely ever
made it past the drawbridge.
