00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,259
- Welcome; I am
Melissa de Leon Mason.

8
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm really thrilled to be here.

9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,263
This is my first time at The
Great Wisconsin Quilt Show,

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,265
and I am a little bit
overwhelmed

11
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,733
by how massive it is,

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,436
how many people there are,
and all the great things to see.

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,540
So I'm really excited, and I'm
really glad that you're here.

14
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,341
Thank you for taking the time
to come in.

15
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,343
I know there's a lot to see,
like I said.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,546
So it's nice for you
to come in and sit down

17
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,348
and take a breath and kind of
listen to what I have to say

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,816
and start thinking
about what it means

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,451
to be a quilter and a designer

20
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,954
'cause that's what I'm gonna
be asking you to do today.

21
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,290
So again, my name is
Melissa de Leon Mason.

22
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,793
I am a modern quilter,
a therapist,

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,363
and a mom of four,
which is really busy, so...

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,199
[all laughing]

25
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,867
I love quilting.

26
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,970
I call it my therapy,
as many of us do,

27
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,674
because it gives me that
self-care, that distraction,

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,045
and especially that creative
expression in a busy life.

29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,213
I also teach.

30
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,281
I teach a lot,
all over the world,

31
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,418
to guilds and at different shows
like this one,

32
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,553
at shows like
QuiltCon International,

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,189
Quilt Market and Festival.

34
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,192
And my quilts have been
in shows and museums,

35
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,994
again, all over the world.

36
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,331
And I'm an active member of the
Modern Quilting Community.

37
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,235
I am co-chair of the Board
of Inclusion, Diversity,

38
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,972
Accessibility, and Equity
for the MQG.

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,308
And so I speak a lot to people
about quilting

40
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,676
and I teach a lot.

41
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,280
And my favorite thing
to talk about

42
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,749
and to teach about is design.

43
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,917
Because as quilters,

44
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,919
we start by making other
people's patterns, right?

45
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,588
We start by getting drawn in
by those quilts that we see

46
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,990
at shows like this, and we say,

47
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,591
"I wanna try that,
I wanna make that."

48
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,993
And then we get to this point

49
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,395
where we see a shape that
really calls us, and we're like,

50
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,397
"I'm gonna try that; maybe
I'm gonna try just that."

51
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,066
Or we're playing with a pattern
and we think, "I like it,

52
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,535
but I want it bigger."

53
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,604
And so we adjust and we
start playing with scale.

54
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,307
And that's the gateway drug
right there

55
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,409
to becoming your own designer.

56
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,810
So when I call you a designer,

57
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,812
when I say everyone
in this room is a designer,

58
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,548
some of you might be
intimidated by that,

59
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,118
but baby steps;
you will get there.

60
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:34,388
Because every time
we make a design choice

61
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,425
in the work that we do, we are
designing, we are creatives,

62
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,127
and that's who we are
in this room,

63
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,162
because it's a beautiful weekend

64
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,565
and a lot of us have come
from a long ways away.

65
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,568
A lot of us not, you know,
so long, so far away,

66
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,636
but we've come here,
we've gathered to here

67
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,472
on this beautiful weekend
to be inside

68
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,509
with tens of thousands
of our best quilty friends

69
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,778
that we've never met,
and see all these quilts

70
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,279
and shop all these
vending booths

71
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,216
and buy all this fabric, right?

72
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,052
Because there's something
about this that calls to us.

73
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,420
It's important to you.

74
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,622
The fact that you're here means
that it's important to you,

75
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,959
that there is a part of your
soul that is in quilting.

76
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,560
And so today,
I wanna nurture that

77
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,761
and celebrate that a little bit

78
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,331
and invite you to do
the same thing.

79
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,498
So I'm gonna be talking

80
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,767
about making your
quilting process personal

81
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,203
by reaching into your own
culture and history.

82
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,273
I strongly believe that
we imbue parts of ourselves

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,075
into the work that we make.

84
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,310
So I wanna talk about how
to design with meaning

85
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,713
and with beauty and with history
in our minds

86
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,548
and with our hands.

87
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,483
Some of you have probably
designed your own quilts,

88
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,452
some of you have not.

89
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,821
Wherever you are
in the journey, I'm hoping

90
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,757
that this will be a comfortable
starting point for you.

91
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,293
Writers are always told
to write what they know.

92
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,362
And I think as quilters,
when we start designing,

93
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,863
designing what we know

94
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,567
is a really good place
to start and even stay.

95
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,203
And what do we know, like,
better than ourselves, right?

96
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,540
So we're gonna talk about
where, how to explore,

97
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,308
what things can serve
as launching points,

98
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,978
how to get your brain thinking
about translating something

99
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:10,284
that evokes meaning for you
into a tangible, created object.

100
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,086
So although I lecture a lot,
I'm most comfortable

101
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,888
when we can all be part
of this conversation.

102
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,490
So I invite you
to really think about

103
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:19,560
how this applies to you and
any questions you might have.

104
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,863
And at the end, like we said,
I'll be taking your questions

105
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,731
and I invite your thoughts.

106
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:30,604
Okay, so let's start by talking
about how personal quilts are.

107
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,740
Quilters have been creating
meaningful personal quilts

108
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,476
for really as long as quilting
has existed, right?

109
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,314
And in all ways, or in some
ways, all quilts tell a story.

110
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,548
So a couple years ago,

111
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,751
I was curating an exhibit
for a museum

112
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,486
and found myself in the archives

113
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,623
of a local small town
history museum.

114
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,658
And while I was there,
I found this crazy quilt,

115
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,860
and it didn't fit the parameters

116
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,928
of what I was curating
for this show,

117
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,164
but I started spending
more time with it.

118
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,533
And really, I mean, I'm trying
to do this show quickly,

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,768
so we're pulling out quilts,
we're looking at 'em,

120
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,271
we're putting 'em back away,
right, pretty quickly.

121
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,673
But this one caught
my attention,

122
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,209
this historic crazy quilt

123
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,479
because my eyes kept
catching on details.

124
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,381
And this is a terrible picture,

125
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,484
but I'm gonna get closer up
on it for you.

126
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,320
Because I started
catching my eye on symbols

127
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,891
that were embroidered
in the blocks and words

128
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,126
and little details,
and I noticed names

129
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,162
and some scraps that were
hand-painted or watercolored

130
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,665
or drawn in with ink or pencil.

131
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:32,933
And so I examined the quilt

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,735
and I kind of really
got pulled into it.

133
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,705
And it started telling me a
story, a really cool story,

134
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,541
just from this quilt top.

135
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,743
It wasn't quilted,
it wasn't backed.

136
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,211
It was just the top itself.

137
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,147
And so on the back, I could
see all the pencil marks

138
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,584
of the people who had written
into these blocks.

139
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,119
So what this was
was a gift

140
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,389
for the marriage
of two people in 1903.

141
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,558
And the blocks in it,
some had been created

142
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,626
as early as the 1870s.

143
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:03,263
So people had been
holding onto these maybe

144
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,731
to put into this quilt.

145
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,133
The quilt didn't have a backing,

146
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,769
so I could see the
pencil writing.

147
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,505
And it said things like,
"a piece of Tom's tie,"

148
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,742
or "lace from my wedding gown,"
or "Mother's handkerchief."

149
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,945
So with only the names
of the couple and the year,

150
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,213
I hit ancestry.com

151
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,615
and I went down a rabbit hole,
like you do, right?

152
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,686
I spent hours tracking down
this family, finding the names,

153
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,155
locating them in history,
and tracing their story

154
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,525
from a tiny town in New York
through Missouri,

155
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,093
and then into this tiny town

156
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,796
in the mountains
of northern Utah.

157
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,131
I tracked it down so far

158
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,501
that I was able to send
a Facebook message

159
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,203
to the direct descendant
of this couple,

160
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,039
who actually only lived a
couple miles away from my house,

161
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,542
and let them know that
this quilt was in the archive

162
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,444
and kind of told them
the story of it.

163
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,147
It was a lot of fun because
this quilt told a story

164
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,883
about the hands that made it.

165
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,285
It created this picture,

166
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,989
this image of this significant
event in the owner's life,

167
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,091
and all of the people
who loved them

168
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,460
and all of the materials used
to create it.

169
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,996
Now, we rarely see this
kind of organization

170
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,865
and detail in quiltmaking
for life events today

171
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,967
with the pencil
and the documentation.

172
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,869
Document your quilts,
label your quilts

173
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,739
because it's gonna be so helpful
for future historians

174
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,574
when they take a look at them.

175
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,610
Today, memory quilts take
the form of T-shirt quilts,

176
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,413
a quick and cozy way
to celebrate experiences

177
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,415
and to remember loved ones.

178
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,617
And contemporary quilters
have also embraced

179
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:34,321
using meaningful materials
in designs.

180
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,722
So these kinds of quilts
connect us

181
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,558
to the past and to others.

182
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,260
So keeping this in mind,
I wanna take a look

183
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,897
at how to design a different
type of keepsake quilt,

184
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,668
one that connects to you,
yourself, your story,

185
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,837
and your cultural heritage.

186
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,039
Now, although I live
in Logan, Utah currently

187
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,841
with my husband and four kids,

188
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,676
I grew up on the
Texas-Mexico border,

189
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:59,413
part of a large, close-knit
Mexican-American family,

190
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,415
where everyone lived within
a few blocks of each other

191
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,284
and things were loud
and colorful and wonderful.

192
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,221
And my childhood
straddled two cultures,

193
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,489
two sides of the borders,
all at once.

194
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,724
So the colors and the sights

195
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,559
and the experiences
of that childhood

196
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,929
is kind of a rich landscape
that I look to when I design,

197
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,067
as you can see from the colors
that I use and the motifs.

198
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,236
And I'll get into that
a little bit more,

199
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,305
because what I wanna do
right now is talk about you,

200
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,508
because the point of this
whole lecture is to get you

201
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,076
to start exploring
your background

202
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:34,081
and see if you can't find points
of inspiration to draw from.

203
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,984
So let's start by talking
about where you come from.

204
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,519
I wanna break this
into two parts.

205
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,221
First, your story, and second,
your cultural heritage.

206
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,023
So these two things
are woven together

207
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,658
along with a
million other things

208
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,528
to form part of your identity.

209
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,030
There's a lot that goes
into the formation of you,

210
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,832
but for the purposes
of what we're doing here,

211
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,268
those are the two areas
that I wanna focus on.

212
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,970
Okay, so let's think about
the concept of story.

213
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,472
Concretely, who are you?

214
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,840
Where do you come from?

215
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,676
Again, great rabbit hole
to go down

216
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,077
if you have time on your hands,

217
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,079
and even if you don't
and you want a distraction.

218
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,248
Start by exploring
your family tree.

219
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,517
Even if you have before,

220
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,219
even if you already know
a little bit

221
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,687
about where you come from,

222
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,657
you never quite know what
you're gonna find, right?

223
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,393
So I've been working on my
family history for a long time,

224
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,895
and I'm constantly surprised
by the things I find.

225
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,330
And diving into your family tree

226
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:28,068
uncovers people who are vibrant
and complex and intentional,

227
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,003
just as much as we are today,

228
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,573
just as three-dimensional
as we are today.

229
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,975
And it's kind of amazing
to be able to look into that

230
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,376
and to be able to discover that.

231
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,312
So here's some places to start.

232
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,780
Ancestry websites.

233
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,615
DNA testing; that's so popular.

234
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,883
I have a lot of friends

235
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,452
who have discovered a lot
of surprises through those.

236
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,487
Ask your family members
for stories.

237
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:51,491
Take an oral history of your
family if you haven't before.

238
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,659
So I'm gonna be using

239
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,262
my own family background
as an example.

240
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,864
I got into learning
about my family's history

241
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,299
because my grandpa
spent a lot of time on it.

242
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,336
It was kind of his passion,
especially in his later years.

243
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,005
And he drew me in with stories
about these

244
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,441
great-great-something
grandparents

245
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,309
who settled a
large part of Texas

246
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,012
with the Spanish land grant.

247
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,482
And the stories of their lives,
wars and predators

248
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,552
and even pirates were
just fascinating to me

249
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,689
to delve into these histories,
to look at these documents.

250
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:26,627
Here's a monument that my
grandpa helped to get erected

251
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,295
on the Texas State
Capitol grounds,

252
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,865
honoring those Tejano pioneers
that my family was part of.

253
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,334
The settlement that they
founded, the de Leons,

254
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:38,672
is a city today, with still
in the city, the church

255
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,007
that my great-great-something,

256
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,209
I never remember how
many generations back,

257
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:45,712
grandmother built
with her Spanish dowry

258
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,715
and holds artifacts
from her own home still

259
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,684
from the mid-1800s.

260
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,519
Further back in my
family history,

261
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,755
I discovered a name of a woman,

262
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,824
only a name that I am dying
to know more about.

263
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,460
It was Ana Lucia,
the White Lightning.

264
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,929
That was all she was known as.

265
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,131
So I'm just, like, dying
to know who that woman is

266
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,399
and what her story is.

267
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,835
There's so many cool things
that you can discover,

268
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,203
so talk to your relatives,

269
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,771
find out the story
of your family.

270
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,073
Years ago, I directed a
women's oral history project

271
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,508
for a local university.

272
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,109
And through this, I
interviewed hundreds of women,

273
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,478
sitting down with them
and a recorder

274
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,414
and just listening
to their life stories.

275
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,483
And I discovered that
at the beginning

276
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,319
of each interview process,

277
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,254
everyone would say
the exact same thing,

278
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,323
"My life is not
that interesting."

279
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,292
And at the end,
they and I would realize

280
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,429
that there is this
complex, dynamic life

281
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,599
in this person
and in their stories.

282
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,000
I also started recording
the oral histories

283
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,703
of some of my own
family members.

284
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,871
And it's been a treasure.

285
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,507
Especially since my grandpa
has passed on,

286
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:50,077
it's really been an amazing
thing to have sat down and done.

287
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,112
Story also encompasses
all of the things

288
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,282
you've inherited from the people
and places that you come from.

289
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,651
So the world is a large,
diverse place.

290
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,687
We all come from somewhere,
even if we have to go way back

291
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,423
or do some digging
to kind of figure it out.

292
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,859
So your story is made up
of all of these things

293
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:10,197
that came before you and your
family, in your community,

294
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,532
the people who raised you.

295
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,601
It's informed by tribe, ethnic
group, country of origin,

296
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,671
ancestry, the landscape
around you, geography,

297
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,741
religious identity, et cetera.

298
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,677
So I want you to really
think about these things.

299
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,749
Do any of these factors play
largely into the story of you?

300
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,250
It's a really good exercise

301
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,919
to think about some
of the influences

302
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,289
you might not have given weight
to in the past.

303
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,791
How have these things
made you who you are?

304
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,327
I grew up in the very,
very flat Rio Grande Valley,

305
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,396
and now I live in the mountains
of northern Utah.

306
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,797
The landscape is very different,

307
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,834
and I notice it influencing me
in some of the colors

308
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,103
or shapes or motifs that
I've started to go towards.

309
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,072
So I want you to think

310
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,210
about how these things
have made you who you are.

311
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,112
Is there something about them
that calls to you,

312
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,347
that stands out to you?

313
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:01,949
Is there anything about them
that you've noticed

314
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,985
makes you pay attention
when you look at art,

315
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,386
when you look at quilting,

316
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,256
when you're pulling
or are pulled towards things,

317
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,824
the patterns you're drawn to?

318
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,861
So think about that,
and I'd love to hear from you

319
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,196
at the end if you
have any thoughts.

320
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,397
For me, again,
it's the experience

321
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,099
of being Mexican-American
that jumps out to me

322
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,501
when I think about my childhood

323
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,102
as a little Latina
on the border,

324
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,904
that makes me wanna
explore that deeper.

325
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,305
That's the story
I like to explore

326
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,541
when I'm looking
for inspiration.

327
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,910
So let's talk about
your cultural heritage.

328
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,513
This includes objects
that represent our history

329
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,983
and our identity, our bond
to the past, to our community.

330
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,318
Cultural heritage often
brings to mind artifacts,

331
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,987
like paintings
and drawings and prints

332
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,722
and mosaics and sculptures,

333
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,290
historical monuments
and buildings,

334
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,626
as well as archaeological sites.

335
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,094
But the concept
of cultural heritage

336
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,695
is even wider than that.

337
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:52,065
And it's gradually grown
to include kind of all aspects

338
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,068
and evidence of human creativity
and expression:

339
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,971
photographs, documents,
books, and manuscripts,

340
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,207
instruments, individual objects.

341
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,476
And it's not only limited
to material things

342
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:03,677
that we can see and touch.

343
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,712
It also consists
of the immaterial,

344
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,147
traditions, oral history,

345
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,650
the stories that get passed
down, performing arts,

346
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,886
social practices,
traditional craftsmanship,

347
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,690
representations, rituals,
things that get transmitted

348
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:19,726
from generation to generation
within a community.

349
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,829
So look for other clues
about where you come from,

350
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,965
what's important to your family.

351
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,834
What are the prized recipes?

352
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,502
What are the stories
that get told

353
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,138
over and over
at family reunions?

354
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,807
What is the dish,
the literal dish,

355
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,443
the platter that the food
is always served on,

356
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,779
that you remember
in your mom's cupboard?

357
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:40,414
What cool old
photographs come up

358
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,115
and everybody laughs about?

359
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,450
These things are your research

360
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,552
and your background for
designing where you come from.

361
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,921
So spend some time
exploring this area.

362
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,557
Especially if you're looking
to discover your voice,

363
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,527
your heritage is a really
good place to start.

364
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,229
Explore these things deeper.

365
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:59,099
What are the stories
and objects and works of art

366
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,169
and expressions
that speak to you?

367
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,972
So I want you to really
think about that.

368
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,640
Now, going back
to my own example.

369
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,509
Again, it's the colors
and movements

370
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,177
associated with the
Mexican-American world

371
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,445
that I think of.

372
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:13,881
The bright colors
of my aunt's walls,

373
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,283
the ceramic painted churches,

374
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,953
and the bright pottery
that everyone had,

375
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,590
and then especially the bold,
flowing folklorico skirts

376
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,460
from the dance lessons
I took as little girl

377
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,229
that I didn't really appreciate
as much back then.

378
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,397
Now I wish I had.

379
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:31,999
For me, it's yards
and yards of fabric

380
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,400
and being able
to twirl that around.

381
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,135
That was enough, right?

382
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,938
Not so much the dance steps,
but the skirts.

383
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,174
So enchanting, isn't it?

384
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,711
So much movement;
seems to have a life of its own.

385
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,880
So that's something
I go back to.

386
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,817
So what I'm hoping
by spending all the time

387
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,453
talking about your background
is that if you haven't before,

388
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,855
you'll take time
to connect with it,

389
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:58,392
'cause it can be a really
major resource for inspiration

390
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,294
and inspiration that's personal,

391
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,963
that really means
something to you, right?

392
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,399
Because it's amazing to be able
to create patterns

393
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,267
that other people make.

394
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,803
But it feels a little different

395
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,172
when you put a little bit
of yourself into that,

396
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,740
in whatever way that looks like,

397
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,442
in the colors
and the fabrics you choose

398
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,144
and how you manipulate
that pattern,

399
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,546
and how you start
to design your own work

400
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,481
and what you use your work for.

401
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,183
Those are all
of the design choices,

402
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,554
the little points of influence
where you put yourself into it.

403
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,889
So let's talk about,

404
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:31,225
as we think about design
and inspiration,

405
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,828
where we as quilters usually
look for inspiration.

406
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,298
So a few years ago, my friend
Steph did an informal poll

407
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,667
of fellow quilt designers
in the Modern Quilt Community

408
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,670
and put this graphic together.

409
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,073
These are kind of the results
of her poll

410
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,943
as the many things that people
would said they looked to

411
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,312
when they're getting inspired
to design quilts.

412
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,848
So take a moment
and take a look at this.

413
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:59,920
Carpet, tiles, fashion,
math, personal challenges,

414
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,826
updating traditional blocks,
building facades.

415
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,395
Has anyone ever
visited somewhere and said,

416
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,631
"Ooh, I really like that drain.

417
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,966
That little grate
is kind of amazing."

418
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,635
Especially the grates
around trees,

419
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,537
usually really cool
and geometric.

420
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,772
Or you see the facade of a
building and you're like,

421
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,074
"There is something to that arch
that I really like,"

422
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,777
and you take a picture of it.

423
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,914
Science, I thought that was
a really interesting place.

424
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,616
My brain doesn't go to science
for inspiration,

425
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,218
but it was really cool
to see this

426
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,788
and then start to get to know
some quilters who use science

427
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:38,959
to generate their designs,
either in a very organic way

428
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:42,829
or using technology,
generative design

429
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,799
to start to create their
quilt patterns and motifs

430
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,837
or to manipulate something
that speaks to them.

431
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,872
The lines of quilting motifs
themselves,

432
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,908
fashion, doodling,
all kinds of things.

433
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,343
So does this speak to you?

434
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,745
Do you kind of look to some
of these things and say,

435
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,815
"Hmm, that would be
a really cool quilt?"

436
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,017
I can't count the number of
times I've been walking along,

437
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,320
and I say, "That would be
a really cool quilt."

438
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,121
It's gotten to the point
where my husband notices

439
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,790
when I pause somewhere
and he's like,

440
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,391
"You taking a picture
for a quilt design?"

441
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,693
I'm like, "Yeah, exactly.

442
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,494
You're gonna see that
in a month."

443
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,796
Yeah, so think about that

444
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,131
and think about if there's
other avenues, other areas

445
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:22,069
that speak to you where
you find your inspiration.

446
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,072
So I wanna take a step
further now

447
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:29,309
and make these sources
of inspiration here personal.

448
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:33,180
I want to look at these things
through the lens of your own,

449
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:37,551
each of your individual cultures
and your stories.

450
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,120
Because I think we often
find things that inspire us.

451
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,890
And they're these disembodied
pieces of art on Pinterest

452
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,125
or Instagram or walking
down the street, right,

453
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,527
and we have no connection
to them,

454
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,728
except that we're drawn to them.

455
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,162
And maybe there's
something to that.

456
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,330
So that's something to explore.

457
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,132
What is it about this?

458
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,935
Sometimes I see an arch,
and early in our marriage,

459
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:57,471
my husband and I lived in Egypt
for a few years.

460
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,239
Sometimes I'll see an arch

461
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,874
just in a building
in an American city.

462
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:04,378
And I think, "Wow,
I love that arch."

463
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,713
And if I ask myself what is it
about that arch,

464
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,483
it's usually shaped
like one of the minarets

465
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,753
in the city skyline
that I loved so much.

466
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,921
Things like that.

467
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,322
So things you might not
think about,

468
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,723
there might be
a deeper connection there.

469
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,026
So kind of explore that.

470
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,565
My challenge for you
is to start farther back

471
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,868
from kind of the initial
disembodied piece of art

472
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:30,170
that we see
and that we're drawn to.

473
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:33,307
Take it a few steps back,
ask yourself questions about it.

474
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,708
I'm a therapist,
so I'm always about

475
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,710
trying to get to the
bottom of things.

476
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,145
What is the story of this?

477
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:39,379
What is the reason for this?

478
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,848
Where is this coming from?

479
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,150
Why am I reacting like this?

480
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,719
I love asking questions
like that.

481
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:49,223
Start with your story and then
follow where it takes you.

482
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,391
So now that we're
digging into our heritage

483
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,527
and our culture,
what kinds of things

484
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,163
can we in this room
look to for inspiration?

485
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,399
So things mentioned in this
graphic, of course, and more,

486
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,502
tile, carpet, architecture,
textiles, art.

487
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,338
Each culture, each region,
each community

488
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,241
produces these things
that are unique to them.

489
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,710
Certain colors
and motifs and symbols

490
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,412
can be found repeatedly
in the art of a culture

491
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,616
and in the microcultures
within that culture.

492
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,217
So I want you to look into that

493
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,620
and then pull out some of those
things that speak to you.

494
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,021
So I'm gonna look
at some examples,

495
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:24,758
and then I'm gonna talk about
how to do this respectfully.

496
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,427
So let's imagine, if we're
talking about cultural heritage,

497
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,630
that you have Greek heritage,
and you wanna explore that

498
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,999
for sources
of design inspiration.

499
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,502
What are some popular motifs
in Greek art?

500
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,737
Now, that's a little daunting

501
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,338
'cause we're talking about
such an ancient culture.

502
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,141
What part of Greek art, right?

503
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,377
Colorwise, the things that
just immediately come to mind

504
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,380
are these deep blues
of the Mediterranean,

505
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,649
the terracotta roofs
that you see in pictures,

506
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:52,386
the whitewash,
high-contrast pottery,

507
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:56,356
breezy neutrals,
grays of marble statues.

508
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,691
What about surface design?

509
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:01,261
What about artwork and tiles
and carpets and ceramics?

510
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,263
You have a lot of mosaic work,
which is cool.

511
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,400
You have famous motifs to
work with, like the Greek key,

512
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,001
like interwoven ropes.

513
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:09,670
You have some high contrast,

514
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,906
but you have a lot
of neutral use.

515
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,943
There's a lot of area
to play there.

516
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:19,079
What if you come from an
Islamic religious tradition

517
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:22,783
and you wanna look to that
for your design inspiration?

518
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,818
So first of all, lucky duck.

519
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,019
Some of the most beautiful art

520
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,055
and architecture in the world
is Islamic.

521
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,690
Because of the emphasis on math

522
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,426
and lack of human figures
in the art tradition,

523
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,829
you end up with these
incredible geometric shapes

524
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,665
and these gorgeous lines
and contrasts.

525
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,033
You're looking at star shapes,

526
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,003
where the number of points
dictates the design around it

527
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,072
and how those lines
come together.

528
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,140
Maybe think about a
medallion construction

529
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:51,712
to represent the Islamic
art concept of infinity

530
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:52,880
and the calligraphy.

531
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,281
Oh, I'm a sucker
for the calligraphy.

532
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,149
We collected so much art

533
00:21:56,216 --> 00:22:00,120
when we lived in the Middle East
and northern Africa.

534
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:04,091
Maybe you take the idea
of integrating words

535
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,359
into your quilt.

536
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,828
Maybe you start playing
with bias tape appliqué.

537
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,429
There's a lot of fun to be had

538
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:13,667
when you start thinking about,
"How can I do this," right?

539
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,769
Architecture elements
like the ones I mentioned,

540
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,037
the arches, the domes,

541
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:20,107
the minarets would be fun
to play with.

542
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,575
What if your heritage
is deeply rooted

543
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,443
in where you happen
to live right now?

544
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,679
What if you don't even
have to go that far back?

545
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:28,749
Because again,
remember that we're inspired

546
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,151
by everything around us,
everything that we touch,

547
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:33,554
everything that
we see every day.

548
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,757
So again, lucky ducks if
you're from around here

549
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,326
or wherever, but especially here

550
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:42,329
because you have kind of the
natural, you have the lush,

551
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:45,265
you have the rolling prairies,
you have the lakes,

552
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,702
you have the idea of earth
stewardship, the modern lines,

553
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,438
so many things that inform
the place that you live in.

554
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,841
So look into that;
what does that mean?

555
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,710
For me, I've been living
in northern Utah

556
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:00,147
in a mountain valley
for about five years now.

557
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,816
I've never lived near mountains
like that before.

558
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,752
And like I said, they're
starting to creep into my work

559
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:10,157
as I exist in this landscape,
in this geography,

560
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,927
where everywhere I turn, I'm
surrounded by these huge peaks

561
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,129
and this alpenglow
in the evenings,

562
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:19,967
and kind of the jagged peaks
and the contrast of snow,

563
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:22,402
and the turning leaves
that are just starting to turn

564
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,105
in little places, pops of color.

565
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:28,208
Look into your landscape,
your geography.

566
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:29,443
So dive in.

567
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,245
Take what you know about
where you come from

568
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,814
and explore that
for inspiration.

569
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:34,982
And you're probably gonna find

570
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:38,385
some pretty rich traditions
to draw from.

571
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,553
Now, with all that said,

572
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,154
there's something
we really need to talk about.

573
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,756
And that is how
to work with culture,

574
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:45,659
how to play with culture
and draw from it,

575
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:49,930
even your own, respectfully
and responsibly.

576
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,331
This is something
I'm passionate about.

577
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,535
I talk a lot about it,
especially as a designer,

578
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,070
as someone who loves
to teach design,

579
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:01,975
and again, in my work with IDEA
in modern quilting,

580
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,243
because I wanna make sure

581
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,846
and emphasize what I'm not
telling you to do here.

582
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:10,150
I'm not telling you to copy,
I'm not telling you to pillage

583
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:11,985
'cause there's no creativity
in that.

584
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,787
You don't need to take
one of those images

585
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,623
that I showed
and recreate it exactly.

586
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,292
That's not putting <i>you</i> into it.

587
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,893
That's not telling <i>your</i> story.

588
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,129
So take it and think about
what it means to you

589
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:24,531
and how you can make
a design choice,

590
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:27,801
a little point of inflection
to add your own self

591
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,636
and your own story to that.

592
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,305
So I wanna quickly talk
about the difference

593
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:33,607
between inspiration
and appropriation.

594
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,976
I think it's important
to know as designers,

595
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:38,345
it's one of those buzz phrases
we hear in popular culture,

596
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:41,081
usually around Halloween
or sports teams,

597
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,383
not as much in quilting.

598
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,320
But I think that it
has to do with quilting

599
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:50,390
because when we're using design
practices, motifs, images,

600
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,192
we have to be sure
that we're doing them

601
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,062
in a really creative
and respectful way.

602
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:57,531
So what is cultural
appropriation?

603
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,666
It's the unacknowledged
or inappropriate adoption

604
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:03,370
of the customs, practices,
ideas, iconography, et cetera,

605
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,606
of one people or society
by members of another

606
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,841
and typically more
dominant people or society.

607
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:11,011
So to appropriate is to,
as a privileged individual,

608
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,980
play in the world
of a minority culture

609
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:14,214
without an appreciation

610
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,782
or an awareness
of the daily struggles

611
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,551
and discriminations
of that culture.

612
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:18,986
It's a taking.

613
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:20,687
It has to do
with a power dynamic.

614
00:25:20,754 --> 00:25:22,289
And it often
happens accidentally

615
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,791
when we don't acknowledge
where we're borrowing from

616
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,794
or we use something
in an inappropriate way,

617
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,463
especially a sacred symbol.

618
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,298
I notice that right after me
in this room,

619
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,434
there's gonna be a lecture
on Lakota quilting.

620
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:38,705
I want you, if you have the
time, to sit in on that lecture

621
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:41,742
because the Lakota star
is such an incredible motif

622
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,510
that we see in quilting,

623
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:46,647
with such a rich tradition
and history and story.

624
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,081
So take a look at that.

625
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:52,753
Next to my special exhibit of
quilts in the hallway out here

626
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,322
is that artist's
Lakota star quilts.

627
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,459
So take a look at those and then
really think about that.

628
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:01,962
It's a huge topic that merits
its own discussion.

629
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:06,133
In fact, I have a whole lecture
that I give about it,

630
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,935
but right now,
I just wanna point it out

631
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,736
and just kinda let you
sit with that idea

632
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,104
as you look to inspiration.

633
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:13,473
Because as we delve into our
background and our cultures,

634
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,309
I wanna make sure that
we're doing it responsibly,

635
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,977
respectfully, again, in a way

636
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:18,779
that puts ourselves into it,
right?

637
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:20,480
That's not copying or taking,

638
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:24,184
but instead saying,
"What does this mean to me?

639
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,920
What do I have to say
about this?

640
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:31,124
How can I do this in a way
that tells my story?"

641
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,695
Now, let's talk about design.

642
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,496
We've talked about
exploring your own culture

643
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,232
and history for inspiration
with some guides

644
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,434
about where to look,
what to look at.

645
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:42,769
We've talked about how to do it
respectfully, responsibly.

646
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:44,638
Now, let's get to the
creative part,

647
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:47,241
which is what I love,
the process.

648
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,475
So for this final part,

649
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,211
I'm gonna use some examples
in my own work

650
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,382
to talk about how to go
from inspiration to a quilt.

651
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,617
And I'm gonna tell you

652
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,785
how you're going to do
the same thing.

653
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:02,122
So as we create, I'm gonna
point out different stages,

654
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:03,624
different inflection points

655
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,426
where we make those
design choices

656
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:10,230
that are informed by what
you're originally inspired by.

657
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:13,767
So let's go back to those
inspirations from our story

658
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,435
and our cultural heritage.

659
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:17,538
I talked about these skirts
that I love so much.

660
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,406
That's gonna be my
jumping-off point.

661
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:23,810
So that's design choice number
one; that's my inspiration.

662
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:26,280
I have looked
into my background.

663
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:29,149
I have pulled out this motif
that I'm constantly drawn to.

664
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:32,252
And now I'm gonna ask myself,
"What is it?

665
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,889
What is it about this
that draws me in?"

666
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,258
For me, it's the motion.

667
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,595
I love the motion, that any way
you swirl these skirts,

668
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,864
some new lines are created.

669
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,599
I love the curves.

670
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,336
Something about
what curves imply,

671
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:53,373
again, motion,
movement, progression,

672
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,910
that all, it just
kind of speaks to me.

673
00:27:57,444 --> 00:28:00,647
I love the line,
the fact that this line,

674
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:03,183
you're taking these very
geometric elements, line,

675
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,519
and you're curving them
and you're manipulating them.

676
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,920
And I love the color.

677
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:11,391
If you haven't noticed, I love
bold color, very bold color.

678
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:12,726
That's what I love to use.

679
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:16,029
And so I'm drawn to these
high saturation, high contrast,

680
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:20,601
almost overwhelming combinations
of color.

681
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:21,768
I teach a color class.

682
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:24,338
I'm teaching it here tomorrow.

683
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,473
And I talk about how
to put together

684
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,008
the perfect fabric pool,

685
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,777
how to put together
a palette that works.

686
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:33,447
Now, the problem is,
I kind of break my own rules.

687
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,282
I'm a bit of a maximalist.

688
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,683
I like all the colors.

689
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,285
I like all the saturation.

690
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:41,989
And in my own design, I like
to kind of almost overwhelm

691
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,125
and exhaust people's eyes,
as mean as that sounds.

692
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:47,794
But that's kind of always
what I look for is,

693
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:50,264
is it gonna make you tired
looking at it?

694
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,598
I want that.

695
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:54,067
So that's kind of what
I'm drawn to.

696
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,802
If you watch folklorico
long enough,

697
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,273
if you watch these skirts
long enough, it's overwhelming,

698
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:02,075
the colors, the movements,
the nonstop rhythm.

699
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,411
And so that's my design choice
number one.

700
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:05,579
That's my inspiration.

701
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:07,714
That's me asking,
"What is it about it?

702
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:10,017
What is it about
that's personal to me?"

703
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,618
Well, the fact that
as a little girl,

704
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:12,819
I had to do these classes.

705
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,555
We all did in school.

706
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:16,690
Every year, we would
put on a program

707
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,959
and we would all learn a
traditional dance by grade.

708
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,127
And then for Mother's Day,

709
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:21,728
we would put on a
big school program

710
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:22,930
and we would do our dances.

711
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:24,164
We knew all the dances.

712
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,966
We knew what the ones that
the second-graders did

713
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,134
and the third-graders.

714
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,136
And we were all excited
to get to sixth grade,

715
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,538
when we could break out of this
and do our own thing.

716
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,340
And so we do, like, '50s
with poodle skirts.

717
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:36,510
But again, poodle skirts,
big flowing skirts, right?

718
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:38,478
So there was something,
you know, to that,

719
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:40,480
that speaks to what
we were learning.

720
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:44,017
So for me, it's an homage
back to that.

721
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,053
So I decided a while back

722
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,155
that I was gonna create
a series of quilts

723
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:51,558
exploring these
different aspects

724
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:54,361
of this childhood memory
of these skirts.

725
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:56,163
So for my initial design,

726
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,232
I wanted to create a skirt
in motion,

727
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,133
but in a modern, geometric way.

728
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,902
Now, this was early
in my quilting

729
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:04,705
and I was still a little bit
afraid of curves.

730
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,707
I'm not afraid of curves
anymore.

731
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:09,176
In fact, I love curves,
I teach curves.

732
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:12,779
Rarely do I make anything
that's not curved.

733
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:15,749
But initially, I was constrained
by what I knew

734
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,951
and what I felt comfortable
with.

735
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:20,988
So I started
with my design concept.

736
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:24,291
And now my next thing is to
dip into my quilter's toolbox.

737
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,126
So what is a quilter's toolbox?

738
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:28,395
A lot of us have heard
of that idea before, right,

739
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:29,663
your quilter's toolbox.

740
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,765
It's where you keep
all of the skills

741
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,567
and knowledge that
you've acquired

742
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:36,136
in the classes you've taken,
in the patterns you've made,

743
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,971
in coming to shows
and listening to lectures

744
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,306
and going to workshops.

745
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,474
In your quilter's toolbox,

746
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,777
you have your
cutting strips tool,

747
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,347
and you have your English
paper piecing tool.

748
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:49,683
Not literal tools,
not like the tangible tools

749
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,585
that we're all gonna
go out there and buy,

750
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:55,689
but the knowledge
and the skills to say,

751
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:57,724
"Okay, I have an idea.

752
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:01,595
Well, my next step is,
how do I make that?"

753
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:05,165
Or what I like to ask is,
"I wonder if I could make that."

754
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:06,333
I like that challenge.

755
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,335
So then you go into your toolbox
and you say,

756
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:09,937
"What tools do I have
to make this?"

757
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:11,338
So at the time, I was like,

758
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,940
"Hmm, I'm not gonna
use my curve tools

759
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,541
"'cause I don't feel really
comfortable with them.

760
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:17,411
"I wanna use my modern
geometric tools.

761
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:20,414
"I wanna play with minimalism,
even though I'm a maximalist.

762
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,283
"I want to have some
really stark lines.

763
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,820
"Even though this overwhelms,
that's not what I wanna do.

764
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,290
"I want to think about motion
and depth and movement,

765
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:31,892
"but I'm gonna do it in a way

766
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,460
that's a little bit
constrained."

767
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:34,862
So I went into my
quilter's toolbox.

768
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:36,763
So think about your
quilter's toolbox

769
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,765
once you have your
design inspiration.

770
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:42,102
What can you use
to create your idea?

771
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:46,306
So since I wanted to do
something geometric,

772
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,009
I decided to stick with

773
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:53,247
kind of the most common,
basic block that we learn,

774
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:57,184
that is so versatile
and can be so complex

775
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,385
in the ways we use it.

776
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:01,455
And so I started
with a log cabin.

777
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:04,291
How am I gonna turn this concept

778
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,360
into something that
invokes a skirt?

779
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,563
Because on its own,
it doesn't, right?

780
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,864
Okay, so let's talk about this.

781
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,399
Let's talk about
the design process.

782
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,268
Now, this is the how, okay?

783
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,637
So I've got my tools,
I know what I'm gonna do.

784
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:20,841
Now, how am I gonna use that
to evoke what I want?

785
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:25,512
The depth, the movement,
the motion, constraint.

786
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,915
Okay, so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna play with this.

787
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:29,316
So how do I play with this

788
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:32,352
and things like this
to create what I want?

789
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:35,689
So I'm gonna do a little bit
of a half courthouse steps here,

790
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:38,659
and I'm gonna add it
to each side

791
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:42,663
because I wanna start building
out from this log cabin.

792
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:45,199
I wanna start
giving it some depth

793
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,835
and something to play with.

794
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,003
And then I'm gonna keep on going

795
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,805
because that alone is, like,
not very interesting, right?

796
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:53,073
Like, eh, right?

797
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,508
It's fine.

798
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:58,111
So I'm gonna add some corners
to it, put those in.

799
00:32:58,178 --> 00:33:00,314
Now it's starting to look kind
of really cool and geometric,

800
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,882
but a skirt, like, really?

801
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,283
All this looks like is a block.

802
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,752
It's very static,
it's not moving.

803
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,355
So I'm gonna add some
little wings to it.

804
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:10,691
Again, using this manipulated

805
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:14,561
log cabin courthouse steps
technique, right?

806
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:17,464
And so this is kind of the
layout that I come up with.

807
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:20,567
Now, I like it,
but it also looks like

808
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:24,371
kind of the Mexican folk art
crosses that were on our walls.

809
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:25,706
And I like that.

810
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:28,175
It also kind of reminds me
of the Ojo de Dios ornaments.

811
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:30,377
I'll show you a picture
of those in a little while

812
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:31,778
that we used to make as children

813
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:35,315
until our fingers, you know,
withered up and gnarled.

814
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:36,683
But that's not a skirt.

815
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,252
It doesn't look like a skirt.

816
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:41,288
So how am I gonna make this
feel a little bit more dynamic?

817
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:42,556
Oh, that was easy.

818
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:44,992
I'm just gonna put it on point.

819
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,696
I'm just gonna move it,
rotate it just a little bit,

820
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:52,266
because something about this,
something about the diagonal,

821
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,867
think about how it
makes your eye move.

822
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:56,436
So if we have this, your eye
is going like this, right?

823
00:33:56,503 --> 00:33:58,939
It's going across,
it's going down, across, down.

824
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:00,841
It's taking those
courthouse house steps

825
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,976
all the way down, right, or up.

826
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:07,181
Now if it's this, we're going up
and down and up and down,

827
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:09,583
not in the way we would
as a curve,

828
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,818
but we're still having
that motion, right?

829
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,555
It's still taking our eye
on that journey.

830
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,157
And I wanted to convey
that motion.

831
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:20,761
Now, my next design choice,
this is a fun one,

832
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,029
fabric and color.

833
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:24,097
Love fabric and color.

834
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:27,034
How am I going to turn this
flat design

835
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,702
into something with depth

836
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,071
and that evokes
kind of that heritage?

837
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:34,708
So I'm gonna take the colors
that I love,

838
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:38,745
the colors, like colorful
aspects of my childhood,

839
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:41,248
and I am going to play
with those.

840
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:44,885
So the reds, the pinks
of Bougainvillea plants,

841
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:48,155
the turquoise of Talavera tiles,
papaya oranges,

842
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:52,626
the dark blues that you find
also in tile and pottery.

843
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:56,029
So I'm gonna pull out those
colors from my fabric stash,

844
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,198
and I am going to use those

845
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:01,735
to decide on the colors
for my blocks.

846
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,705
So I started with my center.

847
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:08,375
This is what it was originally
like, with that open middle.

848
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,777
But then I realized that this
doesn't really give me the depth

849
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,379
that I want,
and I want some depth.

850
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,381
I want a little bit of weight
in the center

851
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,450
if I want the skirt
to spin around it, right?

852
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,952
Otherwise it all just
kind of exists floating.

853
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,154
So I changed that later on
to blue in the center,

854
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,689
as you can see over here.

855
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,791
Okay, and then I just
added the other colors,

856
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:26,326
just in an easy gradient.

857
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:27,694
So it wasn't too overwhelming.

858
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:30,163
Again, I was
a little constrained in here.

859
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,299
I was playing with minimalism

860
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:36,603
in kind of a maximalist
color palette, right?

861
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:38,105
And I liked this.

862
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:41,775
I like the depth that
that ombre effect creates.

863
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:44,912
I like that it gives me
the idea of layers

864
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,114
and the idea of movements,

865
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:50,250
the idea that maybe there's
some things peeking out, right,

866
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,019
and some things overlapping.

867
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:55,222
So that's my third
design choice.

868
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,958
Then I wanted to give it
a little contrast

869
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:01,595
to add some more depth to it,
and I did that

870
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:06,266
with kind of a contrasting
thin line all around that,

871
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:08,869
and it made me really happy.

872
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:11,004
So Sharon is gonna be
our assistant.

873
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,406
So she's gonna kinda
hold this up

874
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,241
if you wanna see it
a little bit closer.

875
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:15,976
Thanks, Sharon.

876
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,612
- Audience Member: Beautiful.
- You want me to walk around?

877
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,214
- Sure, go ahead,
whatever you feel like.

878
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,950
If you wanna stand,
go ahead and stand.

879
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,318
So take a look at that.

880
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:27,487
Now, let's think about the
last design choice here

881
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:29,089
that I'm gonna talk about
for this quilt,

882
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:30,490
and that is the quilting.

883
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:33,026
Now, I'm gonna admit
a cardinal sin

884
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:36,530
and say that the quilting
is not my favorite part.

885
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:38,298
It's often, to me, a chore,

886
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,034
and I'm too cheap to send it out
to a longarmer.

887
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:43,337
I do all my quilting
on my domestic machine,

888
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:46,073
and oftentimes,
it kind of sits for a while

889
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,808
before I get to it.

890
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,911
But I had to think about what
the quilting meant, right,

891
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,579
what I wanted it,
because the quilting

892
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:55,215
is not just an extra
you throw on top, right?

893
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,583
The quilting is a place

894
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,752
where you can put yourself
and your story into it.

895
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,054
So what I decided to do is,
like I said,

896
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,257
it evoked those
Ojo de Dios ornaments.

897
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,658
So you can see those up there.

898
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,859
It's kind of the yarn stars

899
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:07,427
that we would make
around Christmas time.

900
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,530
Again, at school, we were
just forced to make these

901
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,331
until we were so tired.

902
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,034
It wasn't that bad, it really
wasn't, but it felt like it.

903
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,736
And so I wanted to evoke that.

904
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:18,405
And so I did that
hand stitching,

905
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:19,573
the big stitch quilting

906
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,875
to kind of evoke the rods
that those are on.

907
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:23,477
Even though this
is a skirt to me,

908
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:26,580
I also wanted to do a callback
to that part of my childhood.

909
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:29,616
And so I decided
to incorporate that.

910
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:32,252
I also still wanted the
suggestion of those yarn strings

911
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,453
that make up that diamond.

912
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,656
So I did thin
quarter-inch quilting

913
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:39,393
within each of those
geometric shapes.

914
00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:43,630
I chose a dark thread to give
kind of contrasting depth

915
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,200
and just kind of
quilted concentric lines

916
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,569
radiating from the center.

917
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,370
I had to keep the lines
of the individual

918
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,806
or the invisible sticks that
the yarn would be wound on.

919
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:54,141
And then for the negative space,

920
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,244
I just kind of kept
those straight lines.

921
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:59,213
So that's an example
of how to take,

922
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,448
start to finish,
an idea from your history,

923
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:02,616
from your culture,

924
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:04,418
and think about,
"What does this mean to me?"

925
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:07,988
And take it from step one
to a finished quilt.

926
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,890
It's not actually
that difficult.

927
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,992
You just keep asking,
"What does this mean to me

928
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,961
and what can I do with it,"
right?

929
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:16,129
Which is really cool.

930
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,065
So this is the first,
it became the first

931
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:22,002
in a series of quilts
exploring these skirt motifs.

932
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:26,540
So in the next, Sharon,
will you hold this one up?

933
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,376
- Sharon: Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

934
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:32,145
So this is the next
in the series.

935
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:35,382
This is called
<i>Folkloric Number Two.</i>

936
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:39,853
Okay, so in this next one,

937
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,256
I am getting a little bit
more comfortable

938
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,057
with the idea of how
to play with curves,

939
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:46,059
but still with my
geometric toolbox.

940
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,729
I wanted to add motion
to the geometry,

941
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:50,430
a little more
than I had already.

942
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,766
I wanted to break it up
into segments

943
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:58,172
and evoke the lifting,
the kind of fantastic lifting

944
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:00,073
of a skirt that happens
at the beginning

945
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,176
and the end of a dance.

946
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:03,944
And so that's what I did
with that.

947
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,779
And then I started playing
with free motion quilting.

948
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:08,582
Again, I do everything
on my domestic machine.

949
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:13,053
So it really was playing
to add folk art motifs to it.

950
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,455
So there are the doves
and the flowers

951
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:18,492
and the vines that you often see
on Mexican tiles.

952
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,760
- Sharon: Okay, or so?

953
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:21,762
So now, Sharon, if you'll
pick up the other quilt,

954
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:23,564
and here you can just
toss it up there.

955
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,499
It's really funny,
out in the exhibit,

956
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,067
they're handling the quilts
with white gloves.

957
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:30,370
And I'm just like, "My kids,
like, walk on these."

958
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:31,772
- Audience Member:
That's what I'm thinking.

959
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,842
- Yeah, so you can
just toss it up there.

960
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:39,780
So for the third in the series,
this one came later on

961
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:44,051
when I was far more comfortable
with curves, as you can see,

962
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:46,987
and wanted to play kind of
in conversation with an artist

963
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,690
that I admire
who you might recognize

964
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:52,392
just from the composition,
Sonia Delaunay,

965
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:57,164
who also played with geometric
abstraction in paints

966
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,899
and then with textiles.

967
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:01,101
She's a great influence
to a lot of quilters,

968
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,103
especially because
of her textile work.

969
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,874
So I wanted to play with her
composition in <i>Petite Automne</i>

970
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,310
and in other works
that she's done.

971
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:13,380
So playing with that idea,
I decided to add my own spin,

972
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:15,382
the elements of bold color.

973
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,085
I made templates to create
her interrupted curves,

974
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:20,487
which drops the geometry
of the previous quilts

975
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:23,924
and kind of lets the skirt
spin freely.

976
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,260
I wanted this one
to feel like motion.

977
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:29,530
And I also wanted to put myself
in conversation

978
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,665
with this great artist
that I could only, like,

979
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:34,968
aspire to that
kind of creativity.

980
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,505
And then also, again,
acknowledge where that came from

981
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:41,475
and who she was
and what she did.

982
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,878
So the quilting on that
follows the spin of the skirts

983
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,581
with the background being
a simple geometric grid

984
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,483
to kind of contrast
with that motion.

985
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,219
So again, with these two quilts

986
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,887
that Sharon has just
held up for you,

987
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,823
think about the design choices,
so you know the inspiration.

988
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,259
Now, what were the design
choices with layout,

989
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:02,296
with composition, with fabric,
with quilting?

990
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,164
All these places
that you can imbue

991
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:07,367
a part of yourself
and your story.

992
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,237
So I hope that that makes sense
and it's helpful to you

993
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,773
if you're looking
for new avenues of inspiration

994
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,510
or ways to discover
your own voice in your art.

995
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,079
I want you to give yourself
time and space

996
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,783
to think about where you
come from, what shapes you,

997
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,920
what larger community story
are you part of?

998
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:30,891
I want you to give yourself
permission to explore that.

999
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,594
Give yourself space
to take a minute and say,

1000
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,330
"I love making
other people's work

1001
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:37,798
"because man, in this community,

1002
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:40,100
"there are some
creative geniuses,

1003
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:43,103
"there is some incredible stuff
out there,

1004
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,572
"and I'm a part
of this community.

1005
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,074
"What do I have to say?

1006
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,744
"What can I do
to put my voice in here?

1007
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:54,314
What can I do
to express my own self?"

1008
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:56,049
Explore that.

1009
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,252
Pull out and appreciate the
things that came before you,

1010
00:41:58,318 --> 00:41:59,887
that others have created.

1011
00:41:59,953 --> 00:42:02,189
And then become a part
of that line of creators.

1012
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:04,291
Treat the legacies
of your culture

1013
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,194
and other cultures with respect
and get creative.

1014
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:09,997
Make it personal,
make it meaningful,

1015
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:11,932
but make sure
it tells your story.

1016
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,233
Thank you.

1017
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,636
[audience applauding]

1018
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:24,011
So we have some time
for questions, for thoughts.

1019
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:26,013
I would just kind of love
to hear from you.

1020
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,016
Like I said, I love this
to be a conversation.

1021
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:31,351
Coloring books,
that's, you know...

1022
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,920
So what was it?

1023
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:35,389
About 15, 10, 15 years ago,

1024
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:38,992
adult coloring books became
really popular, right?

1025
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,160
Geometric coloring books.

1026
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:42,930
I remember I was living abroad
at the time

1027
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:45,165
and I was in a bookstore
in Italy,

1028
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,100
and I found a geometric
coloring book.

1029
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,003
It's the first time I'd ever
seen an adult coloring book.

1030
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,574
And I got it, and I just,
like, spent so much time.

1031
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,509
I actually found it
in a box recently

1032
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:56,777
and gave it to my daughter

1033
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,979
'cause I had only filled in
about a quarter of it.

1034
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:00,781
And so she was like,
"This is so cool.

1035
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,182
And it's an Italian;
I don't understand."

1036
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:03,350
You don't have to understand.

1037
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,518
It's a coloring book, right?

1038
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:08,722
Coloring books,
such cool ideas and motifs.

1039
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:11,225
A lot of those designs you see
starting to come up

1040
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,327
in free motion quilting, right?

1041
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:15,329
If you think about
graffiti style

1042
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:18,232
free motion quilting,
like Karlee Porter designs,

1043
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:21,068
type graffiti quilting,
a lot of that,

1044
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:24,905
you see kind of those
free-flowing geometry curves

1045
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:26,073
and ideas.

1046
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:28,876
That's a really great source
of inspiration.

1047
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:32,446
Okay, so Rebecca is inspired
by science and math.

1048
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,548
And so she's pointing out
satellite imagery

1049
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,617
that NASA publishes.

1050
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:40,687
Was it about two years ago
that the James Webb went online

1051
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:43,991
and showed us,
like, such vibrant,

1052
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:47,027
new images of some
of the pictures

1053
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:49,429
that we'd seen before
of these nebulas, right?

1054
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:52,165
But even satellite imagery,

1055
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:53,867
that's a really
interesting idea.

1056
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,569
So a quilt I designed
a while back

1057
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:56,970
that was a quilt of the month

1058
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:59,606
for the Modern Quilt Guild
was called <i>Flyover.</i>

1059
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:03,810
And it was designed on an
airplane when I was on my way

1060
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:08,782
from California to, I think,
Atlanta or maybe Texas,

1061
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,518
and flying over kind of the
middle part of the country

1062
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:14,488
that everyone calls flyover
states, which drives me crazy.

1063
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:17,424
I spent 10 years in Indiana,
and it is not a flyover state!

1064
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,293
It is a beautiful place.

1065
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,863
But looking down, you know
how you see those plots of land

1066
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,898
and the circles in between,

1067
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:28,135
and you can see where like, one
person's farm, like, cuts off

1068
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:29,570
and another one's begins

1069
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:32,005
and different crops
based on different colors.

1070
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:34,174
That's a really cool place

1071
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,777
to look for some
block inspiration.

1072
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,178
Yeah, exactly.

1073
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,480
So the circles, she's saying,
where the irrigation occurs.

1074
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:42,749
I didn't realize that's why
there are circles.

1075
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:44,852
I just assumed maybe
it was growing taller there.

1076
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:47,754
I'm clearly not a farmer.
[audience laughing]

1077
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:50,390
But where you have
circles cut off

1078
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:53,794
and curves interrupted
and different colors,

1079
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,762
that's really cool.

1080
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,130
- Yes.

1081
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,732
- Audience Member 2:
In the quilt exhibit,

1082
00:44:58,799 --> 00:44:59,900
there is a flyover quilt.

1083
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:01,935
- Oh, is there?
- Of Gettysburg.

1084
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:04,605
- Oh, interesting.
- And it is fascinating.

1085
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:08,275
- Okay, a flyover quilt
of Gettysburg in the exhibit.

1086
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:10,744
So points if you can
go and find that.

1087
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,380
That's awesome;
I will look for that.

1088
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:16,183
Isn't it cool to think of all
these different places

1089
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,751
that we're inspired by,

1090
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,188
different ideas,
different things?

1091
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:22,656
Yeah, so if the question is

1092
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:26,860
how to take a whole lot
of different cultures,

1093
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,262
a lot of different inspirations,

1094
00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:30,464
a lot of different parts of
your story 'cause you don't...

1095
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:32,533
Well, maybe you do wanna make,
like, 20 different quilts.

1096
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,700
We all do, right?

1097
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:34,868
No, you don't?

1098
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:36,036
Okay, well--

1099
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:37,638
- Audience Member 2:
Not in this one.

1100
00:45:37,704 --> 00:45:38,972
- Not in this one.

1101
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,974
If you wanna put into one
thing that's really meaningful.

1102
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,142
So let's think about

1103
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:43,343
those design points
of inflection, right?

1104
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,778
So our friend here
suggested needlework.

1105
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:46,647
So what if one
of your design choices

1106
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:48,081
is some kind of embroidery,

1107
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:50,384
or the quilting
comes from one region

1108
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,887
and the geometric motifs
and patterns come from another?

1109
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,923
It could be something
like separating,

1110
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,591
you know, those cultures out.

1111
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:59,326
And that way,
you don't have something

1112
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:02,229
that feels too chaotic maybe,

1113
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,064
or maybe you do
incorporate them and say,

1114
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:06,433
"What happens if I use
this kind of stitching

1115
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,869
with this traditional color?"

1116
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,170
So something to play with.

1117
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:11,905
I mean, one of these
places of inspiration

1118
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:13,974
that we talked about is,
like, traditional blocks

1119
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,009
and updating them
or making them your own.

1120
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:18,245
So when you said windmill,
my brain went,

1121
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:21,682
"Ooh, that's cool
to take a windmill

1122
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:25,219
"and zero in on that
center part of it.

1123
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,120
"And how could I do that?

1124
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,823
"And what traditional block
might I use for that?

1125
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,392
"And how may I put
my own spin on it?

1126
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,394
Could I design my own block
for it?"

1127
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,430
So that's kind of
where my brain goes,

1128
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:39,533
is there's different avenues.

1129
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,537
You could say, go into your
quilty toolbox and say,

1130
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:45,806
"Okay, so the farmer's daughter
could work here."

1131
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,242
And you could go into your
quilty toolbox and say,

1132
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:49,843
"What if I used
foundation paper piecing

1133
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,478
"and made my own design?

1134
00:46:51,545 --> 00:46:56,450
"Or what if I used kind of the
abstract lines or shapes

1135
00:46:57,084 --> 00:47:00,387
"in a farmer's daughter
and use that in my quilt?

1136
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:02,789
And then it's kind of my own,
it has my own style."

1137
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:04,224
Whatever your style is,
you know.

1138
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,827
Maybe your style isn't abstract,

1139
00:47:06,894 --> 00:47:10,063
or maybe you wanna get a little
uncomfortable and try it.

1140
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,365
So I would play.

1141
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:14,801
I think the key is
to play with it, right?

1142
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:17,771
I think a lot of times,
we treat our quilts

1143
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:19,173
as so precious.

1144
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,910
Like I said, my kids,
when they're sick,

1145
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:24,811
they are under my pieces,

1146
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:26,413
and the next week,
they get sent out.

1147
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,184
Like, literally one of my kids
was very, very ill recently.

1148
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,819
And the next week, the quilt
that she was snuggling under

1149
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:36,223
was sent off to a
traveling exhibit.

1150
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:38,125
We can mess up.

1151
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,594
We can give ourselves
room to play.

1152
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:42,362
We can give ourselves
space to explore.

1153
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,298
And maybe it'll work
and maybe it won't,

1154
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,466
but it'll be a story
and you'll remember it.

1155
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:47,668
And maybe you'll be the person

1156
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,203
who writes in pencil
on the back,

1157
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:51,872
"Hmm, cool idea, didn't work."

1158
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,607
You know,
or something like that.

1159
00:47:53,674 --> 00:47:57,177
So I would say play with it
and kind of explore all avenues.

1160
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:58,779
And remember, you don't
have to be constrained

1161
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:00,747
by what other people
have created.

1162
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:04,818
Think about, "What do I have
to say about this?"

1163
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,486
Thanks for your ideas
and your thoughts.

1164
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:09,156
Each person in this room
is a unique individual.

1165
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:11,825
And I don't say that to be like,
"We're all unique butterflies,"

1166
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:13,460
but we are.
[audience laughing]

1167
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:16,864
We are all these
complex, intentional beings

1168
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,900
walking around with these
stories and these histories.

1169
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,337
And I would love to see you say,
"What do I have to say?

1170
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,671
"What does that tell me?

1171
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,274
And what do I have to say
to put into this art community?"

1172
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,475
So, thanks; enjoy the show.

1173
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:32,279
Thanks for being here.
