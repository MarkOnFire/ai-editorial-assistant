00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,705
This program is brought to you
by the combined resources

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,907
of the Wisconsin
Historical Society

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,642
and PBS Wisconsin

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,717
Narrator:
Long before theme bars,
before fern bars

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,187
and teen bars,
there were other kinds of bars

6
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,222
and
before those bars

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,291
there were more bars.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,194
Jim Draeger:
Wisconsin is a tavern state.

9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,196
It's something
that defines the culture.

10
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,432
Narrator:
On this map,
the red dots show areas

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,102
with more taverns
than grocery stores.

12
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:38,472
Draeger:
In order to have taverns,
you have to have beer

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,841
and Wisconsin
was a brewing state, too.

14
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,044
A lot of the people
who settled in Wisconsin

15
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,046
came from
beer-drinking cultures.

16
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,483
Narrator:
Over time, most historic
taverns disappeared

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,152
or were remodeled
to fit the times.

18
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,555
But somehow,
a few remain

19
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,192
and each one
has a story to tell.

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>Bottoms Up, Wisconsin's</i>
<i>Historic Bars and Breweries</i>

21
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,303
was funded by the
Wisconsin History Fund

22
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,038
supported in part

23
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,408
by the National Endowment
for the Humanities

24
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:19,046
and the Friends
of Wisconsin Public Television.

25
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,917
Narrator:
Before the coming
of the railroads

26
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,919
horse-drawn stagecoaches

27
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,921
traveled Wisconsin's
early roads.

28
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,990
Mark Speltz:
The bumpy, dusty roadways

29
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,426
that connected
all of the frontier towns.

30
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,063
And spaced out along these
routes were stagecoach inns

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,866
places where people
could spend the night

32
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,568
get a warm meal,
and enjoy a drink

33
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,871
or game of cards
in a taproom.

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,341
Narrator:
At the midpoint on the
Sheboygan and Fond du Lac line

35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,676
weary travelers
could rest at the Wade House.

36
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,379
Now preserved
as an historic site

37
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,249
the Wade House
tells the story

38
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,118
of a busy
frontier tavern

39
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,187
run by
Sylvanus and Betsy Wade.

40
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,090
David Simmons:
When Sylvanus arrived here
with his wife Betsy

41
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,092
and their nine children

42
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,096
he really had his sights set
on building a town.

43
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,032
One of the key elements
in building a town

44
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,034
was the construction
of a tavern.

45
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,336
Betsy Urven:
Folks that were coming in

46
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,706
might go to the parlor
to wait for a meal

47
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,776
waiting for next stage
that's going to pull out.

48
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,712
Or gentlemen would go
across to the taproom.

49
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,649
Mr. Wade did serve gin,
whiskey, and beer.

50
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,652
You could also get
a non-alcoholic drink.

51
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,621
There was lemonade
served here, as well.

52
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,491
It wasn't solely a place
for the taking of drink.

53
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,693
But it was also a place

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,163
where passengers could
get a meal and spend the night.

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,232
Urven:
There are eight private
bedrooms

56
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,367
off of this main hallway.

57
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,369
Each little room
has a bed

58
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,338
a washstand with a pitcher
and basin and a chamber pot

59
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,241
so you don't have to get up in
the middle of the night

60
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,243
and go out
to the outhouse.

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,812
The tavern served
not only itinerant traffic

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,782
but also it was a place of
gathering

63
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,784
for
the local population.

64
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,620
Urven: Men from town would come
in, again to get a drink

65
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,089
maybe just to socialize,
play checkers

66
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,391
kind of catch up
on the local news.

67
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,728
Mr. Wade did take newspapers
from New York, other places.

68
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,798
Walls would be covered
with notices

69
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,867
of maybe,
local auctions.

70
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,569
Simmons:
Being the largest
structure in town

71
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,838
it afforded space
for public gatherings

72
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,940
elections or meetings.

73
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,942
There may be
theatrical performances

74
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,944
and then also dances.

75
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,380
Cotillions and balls,
we know were held

76
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,250
on the third floor
of the Wade House.

77
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,952
Narrator:
As railroads
began to take the place

78
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,921
of stagecoach lines

79
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,857
the stagecoach tavern
soon gave way

80
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,859
to the storefront saloon.

81
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,128
Draeger:
In the 19th century

82
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,497
a saloon didn't really
look much different

83
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,833
than any other store
on the street.

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,202
It had the same
kind of storefront.

85
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,171
They were typically

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,673
about 40 feet wide
and about 100 feet deep

87
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
so they're big, long,
rectangular spaces

88
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,477
on the interior.

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,713
And when you walked in
the inside of a saloon

90
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,416
you were met
by a set of saloon doors

91
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,418
and a saloon screen.

92
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,854
The saloon screens
were architecturally elaborate.

93
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,856
They had incorporated
leaded glass

94
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,659
beveled glass,
stained glass.

95
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,794
They were beautiful,

96
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,597
very architecturally wonderful
features.

97
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,166
And the intention
of the saloon screen

98
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,168
was to appease
the objection

99
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,571
of the temperance people

100
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,841
that someone walking by
could be exposed

101
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,909
to these
immoral acts

102
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,779
of people drinking
at the bar.

103
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,881
The women and children,
the innocent

104
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,984
would see these activities
and then they'd be swayed

105
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,421
and led off the path
of righteousness

106
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,357
into this world
of debauchery.

107
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,627
When you pass through
the saloon doors

108
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,629
a back bar and front bar

109
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,831
run along the long edge
of the space

110
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,100
and that creates
sort of a work space

111
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,835
for the bartender

112
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,137
so he's not having
all of the customers

113
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,139
mingling around
where he's working.

114
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,141
It's kind of
a defensible space

115
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,111
that creates a barrier between
the customers and the booze

116
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,380
so he can keep an
eye on his stock

117
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,382
and it kind of
helps him

118
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,651
to control the business
of the bar as well.

119
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,221
You may find tables and chairs
like you do in taverns today.

120
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,223
But many of them
didn't have it.

121
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,225
They were just standing.

122
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,361
No bar stools,
people stood at the rail.

123
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,363
It was thought at the time

124
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,466
that it was more healthful
to drink your beer standing up

125
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,635
or your booze standing up,
than sitting down.

126
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,771
Next to them on the floor,
strategically placed

127
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,773
were some
big brass spittoons.

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,476
A lot of people chewed tobacco
back at that point

129
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,478
so the spittoons were a place

130
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,480
where the excess
of the tobacco went.

131
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,883
The 19th century tavern
was almost exclusively men.

132
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,886
It was very much
a male space.

133
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:57,991
The only exception to that
was if you were in an area

134
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,627
that had
a high German population

135
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,997
you would have found a separate
room called the Ladies Lounge

136
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,166
that was for women,
children, and families.

137
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,469
We're going to take a look
at tt here.

138
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,005
This space is separate
from the tavern

139
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,108
it's closed off
by it's own doorway.

140
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,779
It has its own side entrance
from the street

141
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,416
so women and families enter
directly into this space

142
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,486
thereby shielding them from
all of the un-virtuous activity

143
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,722
that's happening
in the tavern.

144
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,158
So if you go into a bar
in Wisconsin

145
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,461
and you see a separate
back room with pool table in it

146
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,463
and a side
or a rear entrance,

147
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,766
it was probably
the ladies parlor.

148
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,471
Narrator: In New Glarus,
Puempel's Tavern run by one
family for 100 years

149
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,542
keeps the feel
of an old storefront saloon.

150
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:53,747
Chuck Bigler:
The bar was originally built
by the Puempel family

151
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,749
Joe and Bertha,
in 1893.

152
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,751
They ran it until 1935

153
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,521
when their son Otto
took over.

154
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,056
He ran the bar
for 58 years.

155
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,427
He lived upstairs all that time,
raised a family, retired

156
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,464
and then finally
sold the tavern to us.

157
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,466
So we're the third owner

158
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:16,336
and the first non-Puempel
to own the tavern.

159
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,772
We bought it, basically,
so that it would stay the same.

160
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,774
We didn't want
somebody to buy it

161
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,177
and make
wholesale changes to it

162
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,746
that would ruin
the atmosphere of it.

163
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,748
So we bought it
as a hobby.

164
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,150
I still work full-time
outside of here.

165
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,220
That way, we don't
have to do the things

166
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,290
that you might have to do
to generate income

167
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,692
such as jukeboxes,
video games, pool tables.

168
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,262
This has become the gathering
place for the card games.

169
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,831
We have a lot
of class reunions.

170
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:49,436
Things that require
more of a quiet atmosphere

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,340
where people can actually visit,
play cards, talk.

172
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,109
Usually every Monday,
Wednesday and Fridays

173
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,178
they'll be there,
we play Jass.

174
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,247
Well, I got
four nils.

175
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,016
Oh my God in heaven!

176
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,918
Jass
is a Swiss card game

177
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,554
that I don't understand
how to play.

178
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,757
There they are...
There they are.

179
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,862
You deal me these
faceless cards, gee whiz!

180
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,864
[indistinct talking]

181
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,732
Oh, oh,
missed one.

182
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,168
I got to get out.

183
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,838
Trouble
in the house.

184
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,775
Bigler: Somebody will throw
cards on the table and holler,
"Schterk!"

185
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,511
Schterk!

186
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,481
Bigler: It must mean something,
but I don't have any idea what
it is.

187
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:38,018
Pfund:
All my folks and all
their neighbors played it.

188
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,020
We were in
a Swiss neighborhood.

189
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,991
Every time they'd get together
they had to play a game of Jass.

190
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,859
I'm still playing.

191
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,995
Mine's ace.

192
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,797
Pfund:
Ace? Sure, I figured
that was over here.

193
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,533
Goll' darn it!

194
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,602
Bigler:
The paintings
were done in 1913.

195
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,938
They were painted
by Albert Struman

196
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,007
who was
staying upstairs.

197
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,310
Back in the early 1900's,
this was a boarding house.

198
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,346
Albert Struman
needed something to help pay

199
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,482
his 60-cents-a-day
room and board.

200
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,084
He asked
if he could paint

201
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,086
murals on the wall.

202
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,789
He painted them
off the postcards

203
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,992
that were chosen
by the Puempel family.

204
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,395
We have the Andreas Hofer
story of Austria

205
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,397
being taken away
by Napoleon.

206
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,599
I'm going
to take that.

207
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,502
How 'bout that one?

208
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,538
How 'bout this one?
How 'bout that one?

209
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,541
Bigler:
We put a thumbtack
through the dollar bill

210
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,211
and we fold it
around a 50-cent piece.

211
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,947
We let the customers
throw it

212
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,016
and we donate it
to charity.

213
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,420
We donated $1,556
off the back half last year.

214
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,422
Holy cats,
you're mixin' drinks?

215
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,959
It seems to be more
like home or family here.

216
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,394
It's just like
the old neighborhood bar.

217
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:58,298
Bigler:
If I was looking at it
from a visitor's standpoint

218
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,735
I guess it's just
a cool place to visit

219
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,371
if I didn't
have to work there.

220
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:09,042
Narrator:
Many small breweries
once dotted the countryside

221
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,278
fueling a growing number
of saloons.

222
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,280
And from
its earliest days

223
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:18,485
Wisconsin was on its way
to becoming a tavern state.

224
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,021
Draeger:
To be a tavern state

225
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,991
you have to have
access to beer.

226
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,394
Which means you have
to have good clean water

227
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,396
you have to have
agricultural lands

228
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,267
to grow all of the ingredients
that are used to make beer

229
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,236
and you need to have people
who will drink it.

230
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,139
And Wisconsin had the perfect
blend of all of that.

231
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,142
There were all of
the Germans, and Irish

232
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,144
and Eastern Europeans

233
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,848
who came to Wisconsin
from a culture

234
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,484
that was
a drinking culture.

235
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,554
Narrator:
Soon, hundreds of breweries

236
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,889
hauled barrels
of perishable beer

237
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,624
to local saloons.

238
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,428
Draeger:
Early breweries
were very, very local places.

239
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,898
The brewery was really focused
on a neighborhood

240
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,633
or a small town.

241
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,436
Beer
didn't keep well.

242
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,005
The earlier beers that were
brewed in Wisconsin

243
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,942
the ales, porters, and stouts
didn't last very long.

244
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,477
They had to be drank fresh.

245
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,849
Narrator:
In Milwaukee,
German immigrants

246
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,852
preferred the taste
of lager beer.

247
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,454
Brewed
with cooler temperatures

248
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,490
lagers fermented in caves
cooled by ice.

249
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,926
Lager beer gave brewers
an additional benefit.

250
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,928
It stayed fresh longer.

251
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,364
Draeger:
It had a longer shelf life

252
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,366
so it was
more shippable.

253
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,969
So you could brew lager beer
and put it on a train car

254
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,238
and ship it
out of the city limits

255
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,206
and ship it
somewhere else.

256
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,842
Narrator:
An expanding market
meant that the lager brewers

257
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,479
in Milwaukee:
Schlitz, Blatz, Miller

258
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,582
and Best,
which would become Pabst

259
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,584
began to grow larger.

260
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,486
Fire?

261
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,555
Nothing much,
over on DeKoven Street.

262
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,991
They'll probably
blame it on a cow.

263
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,726
A cow?

264
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,995
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

265
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,997
Draeger:
The Chicago fire was
probably the best thing

266
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,833
that ever happened
to Milwaukee brewers

267
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,835
because
when Chicago burned

268
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,671
it all of the breweries
in Chicago, too.

269
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,174
As people came in
to rebuild Chicago

270
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,309
that required
a lot of beer.

271
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,311
Milwaukee brewers
expanded quickly

272
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,548
to try to get a toehold
in that market.

273
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:31,618
Yes, sir, nothing like a good,
long drink of cool beer.

274
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,353
Quit jokin'.

275
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,191
Hey!
That is beer!

276
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,026
Where'd
you get it?

277
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,894
They're shippin' it in
from Milwaukee

278
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,463
Draeger:
That's why
Pabst, and Miller

279
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,465
and Schlitz, and Blatz

280
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:49,870
that's really why
they became national beers.

281
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,174
Narrator:
At the time,
almost all beer was sold

282
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:58,178
in neighborhood saloons,
which played an important role

283
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,747
in Wisconsin's rapidly
developing communities.

284
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:04,585
Draeger: Many people in the 19th
century lived in very modest
houses

285
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,587
or in tenement buildings

286
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,689
that didn't really have
any social space.

287
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,826
The tavern served as sort of
an extended living room.

288
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,995
Saloons in neighborhoods
were always community centers

289
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,997
a place
where you could go

290
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,233
and relax outside of your
cramped quarters

291
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,235
after a long
working day.

292
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,237
If you were out of work

293
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,807
it was a place where
you could ask about a job.

294
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,076
They were a great source
of news.

295
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,678
That was the communication
network of many neighborhoods.

296
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:36,750
So you'd go into a tavern
to look for a place to live.

297
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,853
Somebody's on hard times
and needs some help.

298
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,589
The barkeeper would help
rally the neighborhood

299
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,325
and raise money
for causes like that.

300
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,227
They were
also political places.

301
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,831
The tavern owners themselves
had a lot of sway in politics

302
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,467
because they had their ear
to the ground.

303
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,469
They knew what the people
were talking about.

304
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,437
They knew
what the issues were.

305
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,807
Narrator:
All over the city of Milwaukee

306
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,143
saloons sprang up
to meet the needs

307
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,145
of its many
immigrant groups.

308
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,281
In the Brady Street
neighborhood

309
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,684
Wolski's tavern opened
over a hundred years ago

310
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:12,819
to serve
the local community.

311
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,789
Bernard Bondar:
This was a Polish neighborhood

312
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,859
and it kind of evolved
around St. Hedwig's church

313
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,261
which is up on Brady
and Humbolt.

314
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,263
A lot of Polish flats,
mostly frame houses.

315
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,532
There were quite a few tanneries
around here on the river.

316
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,534
A lot of people
worked at those tanneries

317
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:31,104
so, a working class
neighborhood.

318
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,874
Our great-grandfather
started this bar in 1908

319
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,876
and he was Bernard Wolski

320
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,545
so I guess
I was named after him.

321
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,785
I'd say
a shot-and-a-beer-bar.

322
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:47,688
We do make fancy cocktails
Cosmos, Moscow Mules.

323
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,957
Twenty bar stools,
five tables.

324
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,925
We offer pool tables.

325
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:55,295
We've had English darts
from the day we opened.

326
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,297
The building, to our knowledge,
was moved here.

327
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,299
It was on Brady Street.

328
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,368
We thought it was
a dry goods store.

329
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,437
They moved the building here
with horses and logs.

330
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,039
My great-grandfather
had 14 children.

331
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,176
They all lived
on this property.

332
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,845
About this street,
Pulaski Street

333
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,248
it's shaped
like a hockey stick.

334
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,250
Now, this was a creek
that did feed the river.

335
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,619
We have the tavern on this side,
and across was the butcher.

336
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,621
Then there was a bakery
directly across.

337
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,623
And there was
a dry goods store.

338
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,625
This street was just like
its own little community.

339
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,294
There was actually a bar
on each end of the street.

340
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,397
Dennis Bondar:
It was run by
my three great-uncles

341
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:33,133
which were his sons,
for about 67 years.

342
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,236
Bernard Bender:
My brother Mike and I
took the bar over

343
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,205
from our third cousin

344
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,308
and then my other brother Dennis
came in five years later.

345
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,912
Dennis Bondar: When I first
started working here I knew that
I would be

346
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,247
a part-owner of a 100-year-old,
fourth-generation business.

347
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:50,050
That's really
what kept me going.

348
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,052
How many people
can say that?

349
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,588
I'll tell you, I would not
want to do this business

350
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,323
all by myself.

351
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,325
It can be the best job
in the world

352
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,127
and five minutes later,
it's the worst.

353
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,129
The longevity
in this bar

354
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,765
is because it's been run
by three brothers

355
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,834
other than six years.

356
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:13,540
There's nothing like the trust
you have with your brothers.

357
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,476
So many people
that come to this bar

358
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,679
are just
so attached to it.

359
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,881
It is truly
a community house.

360
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:24,084
Bernard Bondar: Because of the
bumper sticker, it's kind of a
destination spot.

361
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,386
A lot of tourists
come in here.

362
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,356
We've been them giving out,
I'd say, 35 years,

363
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,658
at closing,
to anybody that wants one.

364
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,461
After all these years,
it's amazing the stories

365
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:38,031
I hear from people who have seen
them wherever, from Africa

366
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,435
to the Great White North,
to Alaska, Ireland.

367
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,437
The stories
are incredible.

368
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,039
Bernard Bondar: When people go
on holidays, we'll give them
extra stickers

369
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,109
Europe or Russia,
Antarctica

370
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,312
Afghanistan.
We're really proud of that.

371
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,047
It's kind of neat.

372
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,050
It's of a Milwaukee
calling card of something.

373
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,019
Rock on, Wolski's!

374
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,961
Narrator:
As Wisconsin brewers

375
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,964
began to produce ever larger
quantities of beer

376
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,166
they soon faced
a big problem

377
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,069
as the price per barrel
began to plummet.

378
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,239
Draeger:
They're trying to get
their beer into the taverns.

379
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,743
The tavern owner is basically
buying his beer based on price.

380
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,745
Who can give me the best price
on a barrel of beer.

381
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,713
The response
of the brewers

382
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,949
was to become
the tavern owners themselves.

383
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,951
If they owned the tavern

384
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:33,554
then they could dictate
the price of beer.

385
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,391
This was very popular,
and all of the breweries

386
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,394
began to buy up
and open taverns.

387
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,232
At its peak, it's estimated
about 85% of all taverns

388
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,135
during this period
become tied houses.

389
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,571
They're called tied houses
because they were

390
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,940
economically tied to the brewery
through ownership.

391
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,343
Narrator:
In Fall Creek,
just outside of Eau Claire

392
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,379
the Walter Brewing Company
built a tied house

393
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,449
now called
Big Jim's Sports Bar.

394
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,985
Some of these old
wrestling posters I've got

395
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,987
with like,
Nord the Barbarian.

396
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,989
Then you've got
Billy Robinson over here.

397
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,991
Narrator:
Today, the walls
showcase highlights

398
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,993
from the athletic career
of owner Jim Gagnon.

399
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,162
Gagnon:
I played football at the
University at River Falls

400
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,164
as well as
my brother Paul.

401
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,166
I actually went out
to the Seattle Seahawks

402
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,468
and signed a professional
contract in 1977

403
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,470
to play
for the Seahawks.

404
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,473
I injured my knee
after about a year there.

405
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,743
I decided to get into power
lifting to strengthen my body.

406
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,847
I won the Wisconsin State
Badger Open in 1986.

407
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,849
I set
a couple records.

408
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,118
One in power lifting,
which is 815-pound squat.

409
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,120
Verne Gagne called me up

410
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,489
and wanted me to get into
professional wrestling.

411
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,225
I guess the highlight
of my career would be

412
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,295
going to Germany in 1987
for the World Cup Tournaments.

413
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:51,732
I got to meet Andre the Giant,
7'6", 550-pound giant.

414
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,835
It was quite an experience
to be with him.

415
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,837
On nights
we weren't wrestling

416
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,540
we would going out on the town
and partying a little bit.

417
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:03,744
In 1998, I owned
the All American Wrestling.

418
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,346
We wrestled
in a five state area.

419
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,016
That was a lot of fun.
I had a good time with it.

420
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,219
Eventually,
I decided to move on.

421
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,255
I was selling my league
to a person from Augusta.

422
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,257
As I was driving
through town

423
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,927
I saw this bar for sale
here on the corner.

424
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,196
I got out of my car
and walked over.

425
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,665
I looked through the window and
saw this old bar in the back.

426
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,301
I thought, this is a neat place,
I'd like to be in the business.

427
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,636
So I called the guy
the next day

428
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,672
and I bought
the tavern that day.

429
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,640
The story gets pretty good,
because as I'm at the bar

430
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,642
the first day cleaning it up,
and getting ready to open up

431
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,611
this older lady
comes in

432
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,147
and she says, "Are you related
to the Walter brewing family?"

433
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,882
And I said, "Yeah.

434
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:44,451
My grandfather used to own the
brewery here in Eau Claire."

435
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,787
And she goes, "Didn't you have
an uncle named John Walters?"

436
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,789
I said, well,
"Yeah I've got an uncle

437
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,391
and I have a great-great uncle
named John Walters, too."

438
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,126
She says to me,

439
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,029
"Hey, they bought the land
and built the bar here."

440
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:59,032
I go, "Really?"
I was just amazed at the fact

441
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,435
that I'd stumbled
into this place by accident

442
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,837
and my great-great uncle
actually started it up.

443
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,839
You know,
there were dirt roads here.

444
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:09,009
I mean, basically there was
nothing from here to Eau Claire

445
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,345
which is approximately
eight to nine miles away.

446
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,947
They used to deliver the beer
on horses.

447
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:18,352
It must have been
quite a scene to see, you know?

448
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:23,490
Narrator:
In Jefferson, the saloon on this
busy corner was rebuilt

449
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,792
by brewer Rudolph Heger

450
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,096
to serve as a tied house
for the Heger Brewery.

451
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,765
Now known as
the Landmark Saloon

452
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,302
the pride and craftsmanship
are still on display

453
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,205
with Rudolf Heger's initials
carved right into the back bar.

454
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,240
Draeger:
It was built by the brewery

455
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:43,443
as a showplace
for their own beer.

456
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:47,214
So it's much more ornate
and elaborate

457
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:50,050
than your typical
neighborhood corner tavern.

458
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:53,620
It has this beautiful
stained glass window here

459
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,622
with leaded glass
around the outside.

460
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,624
In the center,
there's a medallion

461
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,093
with a crest
of the Rudolf Heger Brewery.

462
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,496
You can see
the R and the H

463
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:05,232
and hop leaves
in the center of the field.

464
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,937
It has a magnificent,
very large scale back bar

465
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,506
built out of
quarter-sawn oak.

466
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,575
A magnificent front bar

467
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,978
with foot rails,
marble baseboards

468
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,914
wainscoting
on the walls.

469
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,116
The ceiling is copper.

470
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:26,954
It's just a showplace
of a tavern.

471
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,123
Breweries could spend
a lot more money on a tavern

472
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,125
than a normal
tavern owner could

473
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,361
so taverns
got a lot more elaborate

474
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,897
as a result
of the tied house movement.

475
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,700
Narrator:
In Burlington, B.J. Wentker

476
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,469
competed
with the tied houses

477
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,771
by building
an elegant saloon

478
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:49,343
now preserved as a restaurant
that still bears his name.

479
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,345
Draeger:
B.J. Wentker's

480
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,480
is an upscale saloon
for the period.

481
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,717
It has a lot of features
that are pretty embellished.

482
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,887
It has a encaustic tile floor
that's richly patterned

483
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:02,656
with medallions set in the
floor.

484
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:06,827
It has subway tile
wainscoting on the walls

485
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:09,229
a decorative tin
ceiling

486
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:13,634
and a very rich oak
back bar and bar front.

487
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,304
The bar fixtures were produced
by the Brunswick Company

488
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:20,541
which was the largest maker
of back bars.

489
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,010
Brunswick
got it's start

490
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,012
making pool tables

491
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,514
and they realized they could
sell a lot more pool tables

492
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:31,451
if they sold it with all of
the furnishings for a tavern.

493
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,987
This bar has
an incredible complement

494
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:37,791
of all of the original bar
fixtures and furnishings.

495
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,595
It has the typical
front bar and back bar

496
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:43,697
that we see
in many Wisconsin taverns

497
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:48,302
but it also has kept its
liquor cabinets, cigar humidor

498
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,037
the ice box.

499
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,807
What we see right here,
set apart from the bar

500
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,310
is a short lunch counter,
where every day

501
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,312
B.J. Wentker
set out a buffet

502
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,049
of free food at lunch time:
pickled eggs

503
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,618
pickled pork hocks,
sausage.

504
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:06,620
The temperance movement

505
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,889
agitated for bars
to start serving food

506
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:11,525
because they thought
if people had full stomachs

507
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,527
they wouldn't drink
as much.

508
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:16,797
But ironically it backfired
for the temperance movement

509
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,633
because bars
filled up at lunch time

510
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,635
with a lot
of working class people

511
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,071
for which this was
the biggest meal of the day

512
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:28,809
and you could get it for
the price of a glass of beer.

513
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,847
Narrator:
The power of the big brewers
and their tied houses

514
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,849
promoted a drinking lifestyle

515
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,851
in an already
alcohol-drenched culture.

516
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:43,390
The reputation of saloons
became tainted due to excesses

517
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:45,893
what was called
a "devil's trinity"

518
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,961
of drunkenness,
prostitution, and gambling.

519
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:50,464
Draeger:
There was a constant tension

520
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,533
between the forces
of moderation

521
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,402
and the forces
of "the good life."

522
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,404
Narrator:
Since frontier days

523
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,607
temperance
groups fought against
the sale of alcohol

524
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:03,777
motivated by the costs
imposed by drinkers

525
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,979
on the rest of society.

526
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,916
Former Janesville resident
Frances Willard

527
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,885
led the Women's
Christian Temperance Union

528
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,254
in its campaign against the
damaging effects of drinking

529
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:15,989
on families.

530
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:18,559
I'm so lonesome
for you...

531
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,328
Narrator:
The sentiments
of temperance advocates

532
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:24,965
were spelled out
in "Ten Nights in a Bar-Room"

533
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:29,002
a novel turned into
a highly popular play and film.

534
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,871
Don't call me
You're a thief! a thief!

535
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,606
You're a thief!

536
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:35,676
[anguished yell]

537
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,385
Narrator:
The tireless efforts
of prohibition groups

538
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:48,188
resulted in Wisconsin ratifying
the 18th Amendment

539
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,891
banning the sale
of alcohol.

540
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:54,161
Draeger:
Prohibition was
an unmitigated disaster

541
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:57,431
for tavern owners
and for brewers.

542
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,766
With the stroke of a pen

543
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:03,036
they took away the fifth largest
industrial business

544
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:05,038
in the city
of Milwaukee.

545
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:09,543
Narrator:
Over nine and a half thousand
Wisconsin saloons closed

546
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,079
or became soda fountains,
or pharmacies.

547
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:16,216
But in some areas,
saloons continued to operate

548
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:19,286
despite enforcement
of the law.

549
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:28,762
In Hurley,
spectacular raids slowed

550
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:32,499
but never stopped the sale
of alcohol from the many bars

551
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:36,703
lining the main street,
that had changed from saloons

552
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,672
to "soda fountains."

553
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,241
Prohibition had little effect
on Hurley.

554
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:43,243
Hurley was never dry.

555
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,779
Brain Tarro:
Hurley always has had
a lot of bars.

556
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,814
It was a place
where the miners came

557
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,816
at first
with no wives.

558
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,920
Ted Erspamer:
When I was a young man,
it was quite a lumbering town

559
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,621
so we had
a lot of lumberjacks.

560
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,225
Tarro:
These were
underground mines.

561
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,661
The tunnels needed
to be shored up with timbers.

562
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:05,532
The mining companies
contracted with many loggers

563
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,437
to supply the mines
with this type of lumber.

564
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:13,040
Of course,
then the bars opened up

565
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:14,775
and the girls came

566
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:17,578
and the dance halls, and so on,
that sort of stuff.

567
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,414
You can see the old movie,
"Come and Get It"

568
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,416
which was
Edna Ferber's novel

569
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,418
about Hurley
and the logging industry.

570
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:26,553
Erspamer:
A block away from us,
you were in Ironwood, Michigan.

571
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,858
They always had strict laws
on booze, liquor.

572
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:34,561
Most of the people
that lived around the range

573
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:37,364
that wanted to go drinking
came to Hurley, Wisconsin,

574
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,100
because it was
a more wide-open town.

575
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,237
At the peak,
we had around 88 bars.

576
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:46,940
Speltz:
The tavern Dawn's Never Inn
opened in 1925.

577
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,811
That'd be five years
into prohibition.

578
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,846
It opened
as Santini's hotel.

579
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,848
The Santini family
installed

580
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:58,352
one of the most beautiful
back bars in Wisconsin.

581
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,687
It's still intact today,
built by Brunswick

582
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,689
mahogany,
triple arches.

583
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,692
Tarro:
The back bar
is Art Nouveau style.

584
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,662
You can see the curlicues
with the flowers

585
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,397
the plant leaves

586
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:13,867
and the carved
heads of the winds.

587
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:18,338
Erspamer:
Dr. Gresham bought this place

588
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,607
and his wife Dawn
was a little bit teed off

589
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,676
and she said,
"You'll never see me in that."

590
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:25,412
So he said okay, and he named
the place "Dawn's Never Inn."

591
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:28,982
Dawn Gresham:
He wanted to save the
beautiful back bar.

592
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,519
He thought it would've been
sent to California in pieces

593
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,722
and there goes the history,
which I agreed to.

594
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,858
Eight months later,
if the bar

595
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:41,328
which is 10 feet high,
could've fit in our home

596
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:44,398
I don't think we'd be having
this conversation today.

597
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:46,133
[laughs]

598
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,135
I don't, no.

599
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:52,206
Tarro: The main street is Silver
St., and it's four blocks long

600
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:55,175
and it slopes
toward the river.

601
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:59,546
This building is in a section
called the "lower block."

602
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:02,516
Lower in every sense
of the word

603
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,553
lower morality, etc.

604
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,657
They had girls upstairs and
they had gambling downstairs.

605
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:14,061
Upstairs it was a hotel,
by the hour.

606
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:18,165
Gresham:
Down the hall is 13 rooms

607
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,234
that were used
for salesmen.

608
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,436
That's what I was told.

609
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:27,140
Each room has
a little buzzer on the door

610
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,343
for, I'm not sure what.

611
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,313
And one bathroom
for all of them.

612
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,117
Tarro:
This particular bar's draw

613
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,720
was that it was
a gambling place.

614
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,722
If you go downstairs

615
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,857
you see that there is
a hole in the wall

616
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:45,859
looking out
at the poker players

617
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,861
to see that nobody
was cheating.

618
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,897
The money
was kept in the back

619
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:54,434
and the big money went through
the opening in the wall.

620
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:58,138
This bar is perhaps
the last one that remains

621
00:28:58,205 --> 00:29:02,743
fairly authentic
to what it originally was.

622
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,612
There's still a lot of places
on the main street

623
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,949
but they've been remodeled
and names changed.

624
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,585
Some have burned down,
and some have been redone.

625
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:14,254
So that this is perhaps
the most representative example

626
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:17,191
of what we had in Hurley
in the old days.

627
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,459
Narrator:
During prohibition,
early tourists

628
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:22,596
made their way
up to northern Wisconsin

629
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:28,035
where taverns were built
to serve them in a rustic style.

630
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,437
The rustic northwoods style
of architecture

631
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:33,240
is really based
on a long-standing nostalgia

632
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,843
and an interest
in frontier cabins

633
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:39,713
and logging camps
and the lure of the northwoods.

634
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,715
Narrator:
Outside St. Germain

635
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,484
Sisters Saloon
preserves the rustic look

636
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:47,788
of an old resort
restaurant and bar.

637
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:50,190
Speltz:
Sisters Saloon
got its start in the 1920s

638
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,927
as more and more tourists
headed north.

639
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:56,730
They used this northwoods
rustic architecture

640
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,599
to attract people.

641
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:03,470
Inside, the walls had the color
of a crackling fire.

642
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:06,139
The bar,
the cabinets behind

643
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,141
were created by a craftsman

644
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,911
who peeled little twigs,
split them in half

645
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:16,350
and arranged them in a really
unique and original design.

646
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,752
Cherie Anderson:
It's one of the places

647
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,888
that people like to stop
because it's very northwoodsy.

648
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:22,890
The newer places are fun too,
I mean fancier

649
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,892
but this is a typical
northwoods place here

650
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,894
that people like
to come and look at.

651
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,796
It's a log structure,
not easy to heat

652
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:32,099
but it's nice
to look at.

653
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:34,902
It was always
called Peacock Lodge.

654
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:37,271
I'm told the original
owner of the place

655
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,540
worked in the southern part
of the state

656
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:41,875
for a meat packing company
called Peacock Hams

657
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,178
and that's why he named it
Peacock Lodge.

658
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:46,113
In the '70s,
my boyfriend's parents

659
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,048
used to own the tavern here,
and the restaurant.

660
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,516
I used to ride my horse down
to visit with the boyfriend

661
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,984
back in the '70s.

662
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,420
Then my sister
had moved back home here.

663
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,490
We heard that the previous owner
was thinking about selling

664
00:30:56,557 --> 00:31:00,627
so we came and talked to them,
and the rest is history.

665
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,596
I'm on a lake
called Fawn Lake.

666
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:04,565
It runs into
Big St. Germain Lake

667
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,533
and also Lake Content.

668
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,502
So I get a lot of lake traffic,
the fishermen

669
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,470
and the boaters,
and skiers come up

670
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,573
to come and have lunch
or dinner or something with us.

671
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,575
I have people
from years ago

672
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:16,743
that still have to stop
and see the place

673
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,745
that honeymooned here,
maybe back in the '40s or '50s.

674
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:21,348
They'll take a ride up north
to come see the old place again

675
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,350
where they used to stay

676
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,352
because this was all
a big resort at one time.

677
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,323
There was a lot of logging
going on in the '20s up here.

678
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,491
I don't know where the original
builder happened to be from.

679
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,493
He built several other
restaurants in this area, too

680
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,495
in St Germain
back in the '30s.

681
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,731
Behind the bar,
it had to be all done by hand.

682
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:39,800
I don't know if they
had to split the logs

683
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:42,269
but they're smaller and it must
have taken a lot of work.

684
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,271
I'm sure it took him
a lot of work.

685
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,205
I took woodworking
in school

686
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:46,106
and I couldn't do that.

687
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,841
[laughs]

688
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:02,122
Narrator:
In 1933, the disaster
of prohibition

689
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:04,358
ended for brewers
and taverns

690
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:08,328
setting off celebrations
across the state

691
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,864
as beer and bars
came back.

692
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:16,136
It had been a long haul
for breweries large and small

693
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,639
which did what they could
to survive.

694
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:23,343
Schlitz made candy bars,
Pabst made malted milk.

695
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,915
Narrator:
One of 73 brewers
to survive prohibition

696
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:31,919
the Potosi Brewery
first opened in 1852.

697
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:34,855
After prohibition, it grew
to serve a regional area

698
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:38,358
before closing its doors
in 1972.

699
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:42,329
Herb Page:
Potosi was one of many
little breweries in Wisconsin

700
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:45,599
that fought a good battle
for a long time

701
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,136
and then finally
went by the wayside.

702
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,273
Narrator:
The Potosi Foundation

703
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,542
recently brought the building
back to life.

704
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:58,679
Housing a brew pub
and restaurant

705
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,914
the old Potosi Brewery houses
the National Brewery Museum

706
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:04,685
telling the story
of Wisconsin brewing

707
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:07,354
through artifacts
of the industry.

708
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:09,356
The idea of the museum

709
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,292
is that our members can exhibit
their collections.

710
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,661
Page:
I was intrigued,
you know, with artwork

711
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,897
on the labels and so forth

712
00:33:16,964 --> 00:33:19,333
and with the history
of breweries.

713
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:22,803
So I started collecting
beer bottles.

714
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,539
Some of them started collecting
cans, some of them with bottles.

715
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:29,643
Page:
But gradually,
other people recognized

716
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,312
the artistic aspect
of these things

717
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:35,182
and they started
collecting.

718
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:39,219
Before you know it, it had
become a nation-wide obsession.

719
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:42,122
We have a cross section
of things

720
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,258
from the larger breweries
in Milwaukee

721
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:46,393
to very obscure,
little breweries

722
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,262
in the small towns.

723
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:51,198
It was
a competitive business

724
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:53,400
and they had to advertise.

725
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,135
A lot of this stuff

726
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:58,338
was before
radio and television.

727
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:01,375
Some of it had very great
artistic merit.

728
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:04,344
This is, of course,
one of the things

729
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:08,115
that attracted the collectors
to these items

730
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:11,652
because they're colorful,
they have local color.

731
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,521
they have historical
background and impact.

732
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:16,957
Bowden:
Up above here,
there are two wooden cases

733
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:19,092
from Semrad and Pusgh Brewery,
in Highland, Wisconsin,

734
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,995
which is a little town
north of Platteville.

735
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,898
The brewery
went out of business in 1942.

736
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:28,569
The case is an illustration
of some of the breweriana

737
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:32,306
that Semrad and Pusgh
put out during the years.

738
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:35,242
A 1904 calendar that shows
the bottling house

739
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:37,244
and it shows
the brewery.

740
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:40,080
An old promo piece from there
is a nice reverse-on-glass piece

741
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,883
illustrating one of
their prime brands

742
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,185
which was called
Old Regulator.

743
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,988
Page:
Then we have some items

744
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:51,258
such as John Graf's Milwaukee
Weiss Beer, for instance.

745
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:54,928
Weiss beer was the pre-
soft drink beverage

746
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:57,331
for women and children.

747
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,933
Bowden:
There's a Million's sign

748
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,636
that would've hung outside
a tavern, double sided.

749
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,638
You can see
Marshfield Brewery

750
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,707
which of course
has been closed for years.

751
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:10,611
There's corner signs that hung
outside of a tavern.

752
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:14,548
Page:
Well, for us that manage
the operation

753
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,451
it's a real pleasure to do that,
because when we're here

754
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:22,189
it's an environment, you know,
among the things that we love.

755
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:27,928
We hope that many other people
can enjoy the same experience.

756
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,900
Narrator:
When bars came back
after prohibition

757
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,536
they operated under
a stricter set of rules

758
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:38,839
that banned using the word
"saloon" in a bar's name.

759
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:42,776
Draeger:
There's a strong idea
that they didn't want to go back

760
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:45,546
to the lawless saloons
of the past.

761
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:50,951
Narrator:
A new addition, bar stools
gave a seat to a new clientele

762
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:52,686
women

763
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,422
who first began frequenting
the prohibition bars

764
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,424
called speakeasies.

765
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,893
When the speakeasies come
about, all bets are off.

766
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,962
Everything is changed

767
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,131
because no longer are there
any rules whatsoever.

768
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,333
The women could come into
the speakeasies

769
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,802
and commune with the men
in a way

770
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:11,939
that they never could
in the saloons of the past.

771
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,242
It attracts
young women, flappers

772
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:20,013
who cast off those Victorian
trappings of their parents.

773
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,982
There's a cocktail culture

774
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,451
that develops
in the speakeasies

775
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,020
because they need something
to mask the taste

776
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:29,656
of that rotten
bathtub gin.

777
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:33,026
[coughs and sputters]

778
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:35,462
So sweet cocktails
become of vogue

779
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,999
and women
start drinking cocktails.

780
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,103
Narrator:
Many of the new bars
sported a different look

781
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,439
from the old saloons
of the past.

782
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:47,708
Draeger:
After prohibition,
it's a blank slate.

783
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:51,445
The designers of taverns are
free to do whatever they want.

784
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:55,716
They take their inspiration
from movie sets of the period.

785
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:57,784
the Busby Berkeley
musicals

786
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,786
with all of these dancers.

787
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:02,256
They can't have anything
that's very intricate

788
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:04,291
so they have
these very simple

789
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:07,461
bold, sweeping patterns
that looked good on film

790
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:10,364
but it also made for
kind of striking sets

791
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,366
inside of the taverns.

792
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:15,802
They start introducing
curves into the design

793
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:20,707
lots of geometric shapes,
circles and long bands of lines.

794
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:27,247
Narrator:
A rare survivor of the era,
the Casino Bar in La Crosse

795
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,950
reflects some
of the design changes in bars.

796
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:32,986
Draeger:
The curving booths
that we have in here

797
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:36,990
the very streamlined corners
on the bar

798
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,725
and the back bar.

799
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,261
The strong chevron
zigzag pattern

800
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:43,864
on the canopy
over the top of the bar

801
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:48,202
the real bold contrast
of materials and colors.

802
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:51,438
They're slick,
and clean, and smooth

803
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:53,173
and bold.

804
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:55,475
They don't have any of that
very opulent ornament

805
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:58,445
that saloon
architecture had.

806
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,816
The Casino is a classic
cocktail bar.

807
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,818
It's meant to appeal

808
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:07,988
to kind of that
smart set of people.

809
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:10,858
Serving
more upscale liquor.

810
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,060
It's not just
a shot and a beer.

811
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,895
They're serving mixed drinks
and cocktails.

812
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,997
They have to accommodate
a couple's trade

813
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:18,999
that never existed before.

814
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,001
So offering booths
where couples

815
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,003
could get together
with other couples

816
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,507
and be able to talk
over the top of a table

817
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:29,209
was an innovation to try
to capture that couple's trade.

818
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:32,880
The Casino had a lot of fun
with the idea

819
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:35,182
of Jazz Age naughtiness

820
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:40,454
being kind of speakeasy-like
in the legal era of liquor.

821
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,456
The Casino
also reflects

822
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:46,560
this irreverence in the
marketing of the Casino, too.

823
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:49,196
Their tag line
for the tavern has been

824
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:51,198
since it opened
in '33

825
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,933
"Lousy Service."

826
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,769
So they're setting
this expectation

827
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,771
that when you come here

828
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,008
it's not a typical
kind of upscale bar.

829
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:05,879
It's a little naughty, odd,
and a little eccentric.

830
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,282
?

831
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:16,356
Narrator:
Bryant's, Milwaukee's
first cocktail lounge

832
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:18,892
shows little sign
of the old neighborhood bar

833
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,627
it used to be

834
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:22,996
before remodeling
by owner Bryant Sharp.

835
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:26,333
John Dye:
There was an old stove
and it was very tavern-like.

836
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,802
Shirley Lafferty:
He got tired
of the neighborhood crowd

837
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,538
coming in
and ordering a beer

838
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:35,976
and sitting there telling their
problems, as the story goes.

839
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:40,380
So he closed the place up
and completely remodeled it

840
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,382
into a cocktail lounge

841
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:45,118
and played
nothing but classical music.

842
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:49,756
Dye: It was a pretty drastic
change for the times.

843
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:55,195
Lafferty: He would ask what you
wanted, and then he would tell
you

844
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,698
"You don't want a beer,
you don't want a shot.

845
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,700
You want
one of our drinks."

846
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:02,503
That's how the cocktail
thing began.

847
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,372
The Pink Squirrel, the Banshee,
and the Bluetail Fly

848
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,509
was originated by him, which
are all ice cream drinks.

849
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:12,246
Dye:
The most famous drink he
invented was the Pink Squirrel.

850
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:14,248
The Pink Squirrel!

851
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:16,984
Oh my gosh!
That's my dinner!

852
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:20,120
Narrator:
When Bryant Sharp passed away

853
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:24,091
Pat Malmberg carried on
the vision, still used today

854
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:26,627
of offering
hundreds of cocktails.

855
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:28,629
I can just
make you something...

856
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,265
Narrator:
With no menu,
in a dimly lit atmosphere.

857
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:36,370
Lafferty:
A lot of people would come in
and make the remark,

858
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,472
"When are you going to pay
your electric bill?"

859
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,541
or "Turn up the lights,"
and this is it.

860
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,644
We have over 400 unique
drinks that were invented

861
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,114
either by Bryant or Pat,
or one of the bartenders.

862
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:52,052
Lafferty: Jimmy was here over 36
years, Dennis was here 36 years.

863
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,521
It was
almost like a family.

864
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,256
I just
never left.

865
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,559
I just stayed.

866
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,100
Dye:
This is a list
of about 250 of our recipes.

867
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:10,304
The way we get people to
figure out what they really want

868
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,372
is to ask them
a series of questions.

869
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:16,443
Do you want something
sweet, sour, bitter?

870
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:25,953
Narrator:
In 1971, a devastating fire
swept through

871
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:28,155
and destroyed
much of the bar.

872
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:30,691
Lafferty:
Oh, the downstairs
was completely gutted.

873
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:33,293
The upstairs
was smoke damaged.

874
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,131
Within three months, Pat
had the whole place re-opened.

875
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,704
Dye:
The cash registers
are plated in gold

876
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,673
the McIntosh
is plated in gold.

877
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:49,209
It's a one piece,
three-tiered bar

878
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,211
which you
don't see anywhere

879
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:53,847
It was custom built
for the place.

880
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:56,817
The vibe and the wallpaper and
the sound system, it's amazing.

881
00:41:56,884 --> 00:42:01,054
He did it all in three months,
which was really incredible.

882
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,789
[laughter]

883
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:06,360
It's a bar.
It's definitely a bar.

884
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:10,664
It's a drinking establishment,
but it's also almost a museum.

885
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,866
There's so much history
and so much tradition here.

886
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,935
It's just wonderful.

887
00:42:15,802 --> 00:42:20,707
Sometimes I feel like a curator
mare than a bar owner.

888
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,544
Good bars have good days.

889
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,052
Narrator:
As Wisconsin suburbanized
after World War II

890
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,956
the big brewers stepped up
their marketing efforts

891
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:38,358
sponsoring
sports teams

892
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,161
and getting into the new
television market

893
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,130
to build national brands.

894
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:46,133
The big brewers also began
to move away from taverns

895
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,502
by aiming at the home market,

896
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:52,472
and selling beer in bottles
and disposable cans.

897
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,441
Draeger:
Once there were beer cans

898
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:57,444
it meant that beer became a
commodity that began to be sold

899
00:42:57,511 --> 00:43:00,380
in grocery stores
and in other places.

900
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:04,084
Taverns started losing
a lot of that off-site sales

901
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:07,354
that was such a big part
of their market.

902
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,423
The brewers
also promoted sales

903
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:13,460
of bottles and cans
because they realized

904
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,562
that getting people
to drink at home

905
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:18,599
would be part of the way
to safeguard the breweries

906
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:21,301
from prohibition
happening again.

907
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:23,203
Bring it
into the household

908
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,606
where family morals
can help moderate

909
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:28,375
some of these ill effects
of drinking

910
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,811
that were un-moderated
within the taverns.

911
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:34,414
You see a lot of imagery
of the housewife

912
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:37,217
serving her husband
a glass of beer

913
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:40,687
of the husband and wife
both sitting down together

914
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:43,757
having a beer
in the living room.

915
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:46,627
Narrator:
In the suburbs, zoning laws

916
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:50,931
meant that bars were no longer
located in neighborhoods

917
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:53,800
but instead
along a commercial strips,

918
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:56,203
where they competed
for attention.

919
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,138
Draeger:
As people become more mobile

920
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,107
how do you attract somebody
to your tavern?

921
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,842
Try to come up
with something novel.

922
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,510
Try to come up
with something

923
00:44:03,577 --> 00:44:05,179
that the other tavern
doesn't have.

924
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:07,314
Lots of them
hooked onto dramatic

925
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,449
or popular themes
of the time

926
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:13,187
and found ways
to set themselves apart.

927
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,423
Narrator:
In Rochester,
outside Waterford

928
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,626
the DMZ Bunker
serves as a VFW post

929
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:23,163
that acquired decommissioned
military equipment

930
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,332
through
a government program.

931
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:29,403
Jeffrey Hartzheim:
That's an M60A3 tank.

932
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,471
It has
a 105mm barrel on it.

933
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:33,440
It weighs
about 106,000 pounds.

934
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:37,411
It was heavily used
in Vietnam, and after.

935
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:41,548
I've always wanted to do
something with a military motif.

936
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:44,384
I've kind of been military
most of my life.

937
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:46,587
This is an A-7 Corsair.

938
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:50,524
It flew
about 90,000 missions

939
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:53,260
jets of that style,
in Vietnam.

940
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:57,297
I talked to a couple friends,
an Army and a Marine veteran

941
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:01,101
and we decided, yeah,
we're going to do this.

942
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,003
This is a T-33 Trainer,
they called it.

943
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,738
It's a two seater.

944
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,341
That's how they trained
the pilots to fly.

945
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:09,676
This was our first jet
used in Korea.

946
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:13,881
The Cobra attack helicopter
is Vietnam era.

947
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,287
When somebody passes away,
their son or daughter-in-law

948
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:22,289
somebody,
will bring in--

949
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:24,291
"My grandpa had this
in the basement."

950
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:26,493
They'll bring it in
and we hang up

951
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,495
what we can, you know,
it's a mix right now.

952
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,564
There's a lot of World War II,
a lot of Vietnam

953
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:32,299
some Korea.

954
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:35,769
We're just starting
to get into Iraq.

955
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:37,738
A lot of nice things.

956
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,041
We just hang up everything
we get our hands on.

957
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:43,343
There's no method to it.

958
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:47,214
If we have room,
we put it there.

959
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:57,291
Woman:
Welcome
to International Exports.

960
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:59,626
If you know the password,
quietly whisper it in my ear.

961
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:02,596
If you don't have the password,
we can't let you in.

962
00:46:02,663 --> 00:46:04,331
Incorrect verb.

963
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:07,534
So do you think you know?
I'll give you a try.

964
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:10,904
You can't get in, but we
never turn away anybody.

965
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:14,308
You need to pass an undercover
mission to gain entry.

966
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:17,044
[all clucking and laughing]

967
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,817
Woman:
When you're on the run,
you really need a safe house.

968
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:27,154
Man: Control told us to set this
one up in Milwaukee.

969
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:31,291
The spies had to have a place
to stop for a little R&R.

970
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:33,827
That's how
it all started.

971
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:36,363
It's been going since 1966.

972
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,098
How fun is this?

973
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:41,168
Oh Oh 7:
This is
kind of a museum now.

974
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:43,971
We have pictures here
from the old Soviet Union.

975
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:46,940
In fact,
we have an oil painting

976
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:51,678
of the godfather of the KGB,
Felix Dzerzhinsky.

977
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:54,748
We have a whole CIA collection
from the Cold War.

978
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,485
We have a cell door from
the Stasi Interrogation Prison

979
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:00,220
in East Berlin.

980
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,092
Agent, I have
pulled you aside

981
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:08,362
because we have reason to
believe you are a double agent.

982
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:10,264
Oh Oh 7:
As long as there's
two countries

983
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,634
there will
always be espionage.

984
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,336
Eliza: When you come to the Safe
House you have diplomatic
immunity.

985
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:19,006
So everybody can,
you know, relax

986
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:22,109
have some wonderful food
and enjoy themselves.

987
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:25,913
What's whispered at the Safe
House, stays at the Safe House.

988
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:27,915
By the way, you can't
show this to anybody!

989
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:29,850
Yeah, don't
show this to anyone!

990
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,785
It's a secret place,
you know.

991
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:35,455
Narrator:
Another bar
with no sign outside

992
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:39,459
The Joynt, in Eau Claire
enters its fifth decade

993
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,762
without
an obvious theme.

994
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,533
But the walls
tell the story of a time

995
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,137
when The Joynt served
as a small and unlikely venue

996
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:54,041
for legends of jazz, blues,
and folk music.

997
00:47:54,107 --> 00:47:56,243
I was sitting over
in this other corner

998
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,046
which we now call the Blue Room,
although it's not blue anymore.

999
00:47:59,112 --> 00:48:01,782
There used to be a Point beer
sign in here that was blue.

1000
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:03,784
So anyway,
we were over there

1001
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,819
and Ahmad Jamal
came up on my jukebox

1002
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:07,821
and I said,
let's get this guy.

1003
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:10,958
So, Ahmad Jamal came here.
It was terrific.

1004
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:13,694
I didn't have any PA,
or anything.

1005
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,596
We rented a piano.

1006
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:17,731
Right in the middle of it,
it occurred to me--

1007
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:19,733
I gave
the tickets away.

1008
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,703
It was a really nice
thing to do.

1009
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:25,639
I thought,
if we could just do this.

1010
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:29,209
We'd sell, maybe six, eight
or ten times a year at the most

1011
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:32,045
call them "The Joynt
Break Even Concerts."

1012
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:36,583
That was a hell of an idea,
only we never broke even, never!

1013
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,186
So for whatever,
from '74 to '91

1014
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:43,490
I spent about every dime
this place took in on music.

1015
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:46,093
Over that course of time,
we had everybody here.

1016
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,162
Jazz, and Blues,
and Folk music.

1017
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,766
Dizzy Gillespie played here.
Charles Mingus played here.

1018
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:55,836
Woody Herman's band played here,
and Stan Kenton.

1019
00:48:55,903 --> 00:48:59,373
McCoy Tyner, Bill Dixon,
and Herb Ellis.

1020
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:01,575
It was like church in here,
no noise.

1021
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:03,744
We didn't even
ring the cash registers out.

1022
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,847
Dave Van Ronk, Sonny Terry,
and Brownie McGhee were here.

1023
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:08,749
Ramblin' Jack Elliot
was here

1024
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,651
Gary Burton was here
with Pat Metheny.

1025
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:14,154
And the Blues guys,
Son Seals and John Lee Hooker.

1026
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:16,156
Then, "Hey, your phone's
off the hook."

1027
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:19,059
I said, "Lady, please, it's
going to be off the hook

1028
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:21,061
for about another
hour and a half."

1029
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,430
"There's no point in taking
your phone off the hook."

1030
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,432
And I got Charlie Bird

1031
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:28,368
or a great guitarist
or somebody playing here

1032
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,270
I say,
"Lady, come on."

1033
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:33,540
That's Phil Woods,
and that's Gerry Mulligan.

1034
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:36,510
There's no money
in doing music

1035
00:49:36,577 --> 00:49:40,280
especially if you do something
that's really good.

1036
00:49:40,347 --> 00:49:42,583
People said, "Well,
why don't you get this guy?"

1037
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:44,585
I said,
"I don't like that guy."

1038
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,887
I said, "Well, I don't think
he's any good."

1039
00:49:46,954 --> 00:49:48,889
"Well, you
might make some money."

1040
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:51,191
I said, "Oh, great,
I know what I'll do

1041
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:54,061
I'll start having some shows
that I don't like the players."

1042
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,063
That doesn't
make any sense!

1043
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:58,332
When the Mercer Ellington
Orchestra was here

1044
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,968
they played Lambeau Field
the next night.

1045
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:04,638
Here's Eddy Harris, right here.
There's Jack Elliot.

1046
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:07,708
That's Mimi Faria.
There's Dizzy.

1047
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:10,611
Bill Evans
was here two nights.

1048
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:13,480
There's Mingus,
right there.

1049
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:16,950
And Odetta, Freddie Hubbard,
Ernie Watts

1050
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:20,087
Bobby Hutcherson,
Fat Joe Lewis, Dave Holland...

1051
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:23,323
and Sam Rivers,
and I could go on and on.

1052
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,226
I think we did a 167 shows,
or something.

1053
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,662
I spent all the money
this place made.

1054
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:31,365
The Joynt didn't have
a penny in the bank.

1055
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:34,701
I thought, there are no
old folks homes for club owners.

1056
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:36,837
Let's put
some money in the bank.

1057
00:50:36,904 --> 00:50:38,839
So I stopped in '94.

1058
00:50:38,906 --> 00:50:42,976
It was a very expensive hobby,
and worth every penny of it.

1059
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,212
It's sad,
but it's okay.

1060
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:56,023
Narrator:
Since prohibition, the brewing
industry consolidated

1061
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:59,293
with the biggest breweries,
the most successful

1062
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,729
able to brew on a large scale,
and create memorable ads.

1063
00:51:02,796 --> 00:51:04,464
It tastes great.

1064
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:06,733
[yelling
in foreign language]

1065
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,603
All right.
It's less filling.

1066
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,339
About 70 brewers
survive prohibition.

1067
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:17,444
By the late 1950s, there are
about 37 Wisconsin brewers left.

1068
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:20,714
By 1975,
there are eight of them.

1069
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,650
Narrator:
Four were giants
of the industry.

1070
00:51:23,717 --> 00:51:25,719
Pabst, Miller, Schlitz
and Heileman

1071
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:29,590
all ranked
in the top ten nationally.

1072
00:51:29,656 --> 00:51:32,359
But the fortunes of some
of the smaller breweries

1073
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:34,361
were about to change.

1074
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:37,531
In Chicago,
syndicated columnist Mike Royko

1075
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,701
who harshly criticized
the national beers

1076
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,370
arranged
for a blind taste test.

1077
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:45,138
In a surprising result

1078
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:47,541
the top
three American beers

1079
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:51,478
Point Special,
Walter's Old Timer's,
and Huber Premium

1080
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:54,414
came from Wisconsin's
smallest brewers.

1081
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:57,584
Speltz:
Royko's article
provided a shot in the arm

1082
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,720
and a lot
of free publicity

1083
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:02,055
for small Wisconsin breweries
just when they needed it.

1084
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:05,692
Narrator:
In 1978, <i>Newsweek</i> magazine

1085
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:10,030
declared Leinenkugel's
the best local beer in America.

1086
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:12,399
That same year,
President Jimmy Carter

1087
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:16,303
signed a bill that loosened
restrictions on the home brewing

1088
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,305
unleashing
a wave of innovation.

1089
00:52:18,372 --> 00:52:20,807
Draeger:
People start experimenting
in their basements

1090
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:22,809
their garages,
and their kitchens

1091
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,811
with all sorts
of different ingredients

1092
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:26,813
and different mixes.

1093
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,416
They'd go back
to the old recipes of the past.

1094
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,785
Narrator:
When Deb Carey
started New Glarus Brewing

1095
00:52:31,852 --> 00:52:35,455
with her husband Dan, she became
the first woman in the US

1096
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:37,457
to found a brewery.

1097
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:40,494
Deb Carey:
We were really tired
of the corporate life

1098
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:42,930
and just desperate
to come back to my home state

1099
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,932
and raise our
very young daughters.

1100
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:48,235
Dan Carey:
Deb took a map of Wisconsin
and with a compass

1101
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:50,237
drew a 30 mile radius
around Madison.

1102
00:52:50,304 --> 00:52:52,439
So I rented a car
and I drove and around

1103
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,408
which is kind of crazy

1104
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:56,743
and stumbled
upon New Glarus.

1105
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,514
There was a warehouse here
that was empty.

1106
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:04,151
The guy who owned the warehouse
came on as our first investor

1107
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:07,454
and traded me stock
for occupation of the building.

1108
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,456
Narrator:
One of the pioneers

1109
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:12,359
of what are called
"craft breweries"

1110
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:15,863
New Glarus created dozens
of varieties over the years.

1111
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:17,865
Most popular
is Spotted Cow

1112
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:20,868
brewed from a recipe
steeped in Wisconsin history.

1113
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:25,472
Dan Carey:
We're big fans
of Old World Wisconsin.

1114
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,808
We love to go out
and walk around.

1115
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,143
It's basically a working museum,
an outdoor museum.

1116
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,246
We went out
to the German Village

1117
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:35,349
and there was a crock
covered with cheesecloth

1118
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,351
and beer fermenting.

1119
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:40,053
I thought, I wonder what
that beer would've been like.

1120
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,757
I imagined how the beer
would be made.

1121
00:53:43,824 --> 00:53:46,960
It would be made with
local barley, imported hops.

1122
00:53:47,027 --> 00:53:49,596
It would be made
with an ale yeast.

1123
00:53:49,663 --> 00:53:51,932
It would be made
with local corn.

1124
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,934
And it would be
unfiltered.

1125
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,270
That's how we came up
with the design for the beer.

1126
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:59,673
Narrator: Craft beers created a
new market niche for small
brewers

1127
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,510
and scores of breweries
and brew pubs

1128
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:05,846
once again
dot the state

1129
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:09,917
producing hundreds
of distinctive beers.

1130
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,856
While many small brewers
have flourished

1131
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:18,125
Wisconsin taverns
haven't fared as well.

1132
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:20,761
From World War II
to the '70s

1133
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:24,698
the number of bars
went down by half

1134
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:28,168
and have continued
a steady decline since then.

1135
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,571
Draeger:
Mom and Pop owned bars
have really declined.

1136
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:32,573
There's a lot
of turnover

1137
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:35,442
and a lot of change
in taverns.

1138
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:38,345
Part of that is attributable
to changes in attitudes

1139
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:40,347
related to
drinking and driving.

1140
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:44,618
It's more expensive to have a
license to open a tavern today.

1141
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:48,856
As a result of that, it's not
an easy startup business.

1142
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:50,757
Narrator:
But the number
of Wisconsin bars

1143
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:52,693
remains one of the highest
in the country

1144
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:57,097
and taverns continue to play
a role in community life.

1145
00:54:57,164 --> 00:55:00,167
Draeger:
It's much more
part of the social fabric

1146
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:02,703
than it is
in other places.

1147
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,305
Couples, children,
extended families

1148
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:07,274
all come to taverns.

1149
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:09,610
It's always
been that way.

1150
00:55:09,676 --> 00:55:13,413
It's that everybody's
living room kind of function

1151
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,415
that the tavern has

1152
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,118
that really is why taverns
are still around today.

1153
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:20,120
Because they serve
the same purpose

1154
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:24,057
that they did a 100 years ago,
or even a 150 years ago.

1155
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:27,027
People in other states
drink in their homes.

1156
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:29,296
They drink
in other gathering places.

1157
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:31,899
In Wisconsin,
people get together in taverns.

1158
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:35,636
That's why Wisconsin
is a tavern state.

1159
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:19,046
<i>Bottoms Up, Wisconsin's</i>
<i>Historic Bars and Breweries</i>

1160
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:21,648
was funded by
the Wisconsin History Fund

1161
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:23,383
supported in part

1162
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:26,019
by the National Endowment
for the Humanities

1163
