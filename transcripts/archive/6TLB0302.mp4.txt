00:00:04:00 - 00:00:06:22
Cat Phan
Whoa, Sergio! What's with the piano?

00:00:07:00 - 00:00:10:00
Sergio González 
Yeah, I traded in the desk for this beautiful baby. Grand. What do you think?

00:00:10:00 - 00:00:11:10
Cat Phan
You traded the desk?

00:00:11:11 - 00:00:13:21
Sergio González 
Oh, I've got a wonderful idea. You're going to love this one.

00:00:13:23 - 00:00:15:13
Cat Phan
Questionable, but let's hear it.

00:00:15:15 - 00:00:21:00
Sergio González 
Okay. Do you know that hit musical Hamilton about America's founding fathers and the Revolutionary War?

00:00:21:02 - 00:00:21:11
Cat Phan
Yeah.

00:00:21:15 - 00:00:25:10
Sergio González 
Okay. Imagine Hamilton, but focused on Wisconsin.

00:00:25:12 - 00:00:28:14
Cat Phan
A musical about Wisconsin and the American Revolution.

00:00:28:15 - 00:00:35:13
Sergio González 
Oh, if you thought Hamilton was a success. Wait until we center Wisconsin history. We are going to go interstellar.

00:00:35:17 - 00:00:37:15
Cat Phan
Okay, let's hear what you got.

00:00:37:16 - 00:00:45:04
Sergio González 
Okay, okay. I have been working on this for about a month. I think you're gonna like it.

00:00:45:06 - 00:01:09:20
Sergio González 
1776 is the year and the Colin this have had it up to here with the British and their taxes and repressive tactics. But in Wisconsin, the fact is, it's not even a state yet. Truth is, I'm starting to regret this singing exploration of the founding of our nation. Oh, no. What have I done, Kat? Turns out Wisconsin wasn't even a state during the American Revolution.

00:01:09:20 - 00:01:11:10
Sergio González 
What am I supposed to sing about?

00:01:11:12 - 00:01:18:08
Cat Phan
Yeah, I think we have a little more learning to do before you write your next big hit musical. Let's call Nick. I think he was around back then.

00:01:18:09 - 00:01:21:16
Sergio González 
Yeah, probably. Hey, card. How's it going?

00:01:21:19 - 00:01:26:17
Cat Phan
Hey, Nick. Sir, do you and I need to learn about any Wisconsin area connections with the American Revolution?

00:01:26:19 - 00:01:29:11
Sergio González 
Oh, is this about Sergio's musical again?

00:01:29:13 - 00:01:31:18
Cat Phan
I see you've been dragged into this already.

00:01:31:21 - 00:01:39:04
Sergio González 
Yeah, and that's a tough question. But why don't we meet up at the Wisconsin Historical Society? I think I know someone who can answer that question.

00:01:39:06 - 00:01:41:16
Cat Phan
Sounds good. Come on. We're going to the historical society.

00:01:41:16 - 00:01:46:23
Sergio González 
Okay, let's do it. What?

00:01:47:01 - 00:01:50:23
Sergio González 
John, can you tell us a little bit about the factors that led up to the American Revolution.

00:01:51:00 - 00:02:35:13
John Hall
And most famous ones that your average school student could cite are taxation without representation, or in this idea that Parliament at least and later, the king, had become a tyrannical force in American lives. There are a lot, lot more at hand. And one of the other major grievances is the sense mounting through the 1760s and the 1770s, that the King is going to deny the colonists their rightful birthright to all of North America, to include those lands that are inhabited by American Indians and so, in the wake of the Seven Years War, French and Indian War in North America, Britain tries to establish a new policy where it's going to keep the settlers,

00:02:35:15 - 00:02:43:12
John Hall
hemmed in, more or less to the east side of the Appalachian Mountains and preserve Native Americans in the possession of their own land.

00:02:43:14 - 00:03:06:22
Sergio González 
The Seven Years War was an international conflict that lasted from 1754 until 1763. The two primary forces were France and Great Britain, although many other nations and peoples were involved in North America. The conflict started with disputes over land claims in the area of the Ohio River Valley. When the conflict ended in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris, France was forced to cede its lands and Canada, then New France, to the British.

00:03:07:03 - 00:03:26:12
Sergio González 
Now, although Great Britain expanded its holdings in North America, a number of factors related to the Seven Years War would ultimately lead to the American Revolution. This included American colonists desire to take lands that were supposed to be held by Indian nations, and the new taxes that were imposed on colonists as a way to pay off Britain's national debt.

00:03:26:14 - 00:03:36:01
Sergio González 
You're kind of laying out, I think one of the misconceptions people have, which is the American Revolution, is between American colonists and the British crown. But there are a lot more players kind of in the mix here.

00:03:36:02 - 00:03:44:17
John Hall
Essentially, every native nation east of the Mississippi River was involved in this conflict in one degree or another.

00:03:44:17 - 00:03:52:12
Sergio González 
Bringing it back to where we are in the western Great Lakes. What's the status on the ground? Right as the American Revolution is about to begin?

00:03:52:16 - 00:04:21:12
John Hall
Because France was wholly defeated in North America in that French and Indian or Seven Years War, the agents of the French crown, the soldiers, they're all gone. And what that does is it leaves the indigenous inhabitants of this region in need of a new, beneficent European partner. And it is now Britain that steps in and says, we now are in that position to be your friends and allies and partners.

00:04:21:13 - 00:04:36:19
John Hall
So here in what we presently presently call Wisconsin, the vast majority of the tribes are aligned in sentiment and interest with Britain because Britain is in the position to fill those trading posts and positions.

00:04:36:21 - 00:04:42:19
Sergio González 
So maybe we can talk a little bit about the archival sources we have here that can give us some insights into how they interacted.

00:04:42:22 - 00:04:58:23
John Hall
We have a document here from 1778 during the American Revolution, in which Frederick Haldimand, the governor general of British Canada, is giving this Menominee chief not merely a certificate, but a certificate that accompanies a medal.

00:04:59:01 - 00:05:22:09
Cat Phan
Starting in the 1600s and continuing through the 1800s. Presentation medals were given to American Indians by Spanish, French, British and American government officials, missionaries, and traders. Europeans gave medals as a way of securing an alliance to commemorate a treaty signing to honor native visitors to a city, or as a reward for service. Many of these medals were highly regarded by their native recipients.

00:05:22:11 - 00:05:30:08
Cat Phan
Some native individuals chose to be buried with their medals. Some handed them down to descendants, and some chose to wear them in portrait images.

00:05:30:10 - 00:05:54:09
Sergio González 
Sir Frederick Halderman, a British Army officer and colonial official, gave this medal to a Menominee chief on August 17th, 1778. The chief's name was Chanin. Halderman presented the medal at a general council in Montreal with representatives of the Sioux, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, Ottawa, Potawatomi, and Chippewa. The medal is made of two silver discs that have been found with a silver rim.

00:05:54:10 - 00:06:11:09
Sergio González 
One side features a portrait of King George the Third. The text on this side reads. George third by the Grace of God in Latin, which is part of his royal title. The reverse side features the royal crest with a text of the royal motto, again in Latin God and my right.

00:06:11:11 - 00:06:19:02
Cat Phan
To learn more about Chief Jarvinen and the medal, Sergio and I spoke with the Menominee Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, David Green, now.

00:06:19:04 - 00:06:49:14
David Grignon
Chief Shauna Nez. Our stage name is, Scherzo Okamoto. She was also known as the Old King. And he was from the Bear Clan. He was the one that greeted the British coming to, the Bay area to do in the fur trade on. And then others in the Bay. Bay area. They always told the British or the French that if we build this, we're still going to be on Menominee land.

00:06:49:16 - 00:06:51:23
David Grignon
And he stressed that to them.

00:06:52:01 - 00:07:13:00
Sergio González 
Now, this style of metal first appears in the Americas in the summer of 1776. These metals were likely intended as a way of gaining the favor of native nations, and keeping them as allies in the war against American colonists. John, it sounds like from everything you're telling us, we often have this idea that the American Revolution is about freedom and liberty, and it certainly is about that, but a lot more complicated.

00:07:13:00 - 00:07:17:01
Sergio González 
It's about land. It's about territory. It's about who gets to decide how rules are being made.

00:07:17:02 - 00:07:40:01
John Hall
I mean, these are the two sides of the same coin, right? And I would argue that much of the ensuing American history is kind of a struggle of the United States to live up to the ideals that are embodied in the Declaration of Independence. But the flip side of it is that they do feel that the British crown is impinging upon their rights to treat continental North America as something of a birthright.

00:07:40:06 - 00:07:42:08
Sergio González 
Whoa! What a conversation.

00:07:42:09 - 00:07:46:23
Cat Phan
The American Revolution involves so much more than just colonists, the British and the East Coast.

00:07:46:23 - 00:07:49:16
Sergio González 
Yeah, it was definitely a multinational conflict.

00:07:49:19 - 00:07:52:22
Cat Phan
So are you ready to write your next big hit musical?

00:07:53:01 - 00:08:07:06
Sergio González 
Broadway? Here we come. Taxation without representation. That's not the full story. Truth is, the young nation wanted more and more territory.

00:08:07:07 - 00:08:18:07
Cat Phan
For native peoples, and the region had their own incentive. The strategies were legion. Their approaches were inventive, more than just to survive, but for people to thrive.

00:08:18:09 - 00:08:32:11
Sergio González 
All this to regale of the American Revolution is more than just the tale of British and colonial resolution, its multinational history and Wisconsin's Rome is no longer a mystery.

00:08:32:13 - 00:08:47:20
Cat Phan
But now it's your turn. What would you like to learn? Ask a friend or a teacher to come along and get together to write your own history and song.

00:08:47:22 - 00:08:59:17
Sergio González 
Hey, guys. Yeah. All right. Does it. For Wisconsin, the American Revolution next, Wisconsin goes to space.
