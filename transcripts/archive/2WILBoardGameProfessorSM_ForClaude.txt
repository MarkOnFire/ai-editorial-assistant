00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,909
- Angela Fitzgerald: When we
first came across Dave Beck

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:13,680
on <i>Wisconsin Life,</i> it was
along the Saint Croix River.

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:21,088
The spot became the inspiration
for <i>Tombeaux,</i> a computer game

5
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:26,093
where players explore the Saint
Croix's ecological history.

6
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,962
- Dave: As the player navigates
through this game,

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,464
they're gonna see more and more

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,902
that these towering white pines
start to disappear.

[electronic beeping]

00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,606
- Angela: Like many children
of the 1980s,

11
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,576
Dave grew up loving video games.

12
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,378
- Christmas of 1988,

13
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,715
I received my first Nintendo
Entertainment System from Santa.

[video game sound effects]

15
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,586
Playing Zelda, the visuals,

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,322
the complexity of being able
to play that game,

17
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,890
exploring worlds.

18
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,992
That's really what
changed my life forever,

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,161
that caused me to want
to become someone

20
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,397
who teaches video game design.

21
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,265
[bell chiming]

22
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,535
- Angela: And that's what
Dave did at UW-Stout.

23
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,205
- Dave: A couple announcements
and then we'll get right to it.

24
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,406
So we can start thinking about

25
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,474
what you guys want to do
with your games

26
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,276
after you're done here.

27
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,479
- Angela: Now, Dave finds
himself on a new path,

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,683
one that also started
with a gift.

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,585
- Dominion.

30
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,689
So this is the first-ever game
I received from my wife.

31
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,291
I unwrapped the game
and I looked at it,

32
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,626
and I kind of laughed, like,

33
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,662
"I don't know why
you're giving me a board game.

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,631
I have really no interest
in this."

35
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,767
I didn't say that, but I smiled,
and that's it.

36
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,971
And I played it, and it was
kind of like this, like,

37
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,806
I don't know,
something happened.

38
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:49,810
My whole mind just opened up
to realizing,

39
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,545
"These exist out here.

40
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,915
"I've walked by these,
these walls of games.

41
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,751
There's hundreds of these types
of games out there."

42
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,888
And I just fell deep, deep,
deep into a hole.

43
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,190

[Dave roaring]

46
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,265
- Angela: Now, a wall of games
forms the backdrop

47
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,801
for Dave to play with family
and friends.

48
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,638
- Dave: Every time I'd sit down
at the table with these games

49
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,941
was just such
a joyous experience.

50
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,844
- I won!
[Dave laughing]

51
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,614
- All the while, two very
important things happening:

52
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,850
surrounded by friends
at a table...

53
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,585
- One, two, three.

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,890
- Dave: ...and not dealing
with digital technology.

55
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,126
Okay, so now are we at the end
of the round?

56
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,294
That was it.

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,930
That's what sold me on the idea
of that

58
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,132
becoming a hobby
that I wanted to pursue.

59
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,300
And, little did I know,

60
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,469
eventually become
a way of life for me.

61
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,173
- Angela: A way of life that's
becoming a livelihood.

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,575
- Dave: When I get
into something,

63
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,376
I just go deep into that.

64
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,346
I really jump into it
and it kind of consumes me

65
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,081
in a good way.

66
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,884
The players would have lots
of different cards.

67
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,419
Water cards...

68
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,156
- Angela: Once again, Dave has
gone from player to maker.

69
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,758
- My wife says to me one day,

70
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,161
"You know what, Dave, I think
the next thing you're gonna do

71
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,562
is you're gonna design
a board game."

72
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,730
And I said, "No way.

73
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,498
"I have no interest in that
whatsoever.

74
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,901
I'm making video games."

75
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,538
After that, we're over
in Scotland

76
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,940
and I had been touring
distilleries,

77
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,410
sampling some whiskeys,
and one night, I couldn't sleep.

78
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,646
And this idea came into my head

79
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,548
about a board game
that I could make

80
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,017
that had to do with maybe
running a distillery,

81
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,185
making whiskey.

82
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,987
This is one of the first
prototypes of Distilled.

83
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,556
- Angela: Again,
Dave immersed himself,

84
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,692
this time into the world
of game creators,

85
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,996
taking Distilled to gatherings
called protospiels,

86
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,633
where games in development
are tried out.

87
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,769
And he crafted a social media
network of followers,

88
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,639
culminating in a
crowdfunding campaign

89
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,241
to cover Distilled's creation.

90
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:05,579
- So I set the funding goal
for Distilled at $18,000.

91
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,649
We raised over half a million
dollars for this campaign,

92
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,786
and I never expected to even
come close to that.

93
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,055
- Player: One, two, three,
four, five.

94
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,324
- Angela: The extra cash meant
Distilled could be

95
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,962
what Dave calls a top-shelf
game, with quality components

96
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,265
and special touches
game players love.

97
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,601
And it's been paying off.

98
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,603
- Dan Leeder: Distilled has been
doing really well, actually.

99
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,838
It's a very popular game.

100
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,706
It's doing so well, actually,

101
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,341
that it's currently
out of print.

102
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,277
- Angela: Soon, Dave will have
another game on the market.

103
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,881
Luthier, a game based
around an orchestra

104
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,084
where players make
and sell the instruments.

105
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,119
- Dave: The golden age of
classical music in Europe,

106
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,788
where you're making instruments

107
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:51,825
for the likes of Mozart,
Beethoven, Bach, other patrons.

108
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,694
[dice clacking]
- Angela: All because

109
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,631
Dave Beck rolled the dice...
- Dave: One, two, three.

110
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:01,001
- Angela: ...and set off
in a new direction.

111
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,838
- Dave: From creation
to it sitting on a shelf,

112
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,940
it was a brand-new experience.

113
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,943
It was quite the journey.
