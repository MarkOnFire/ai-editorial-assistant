With the arrival of snow,
the slow season begins,

00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,208
which makes it the perfect time
for entertaining.

to help kick off
the holiday season.

- I love to decorate
during the holidays,

39
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,959
and I really like
to use simple decorations.

40
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,625
I like to achieve that
Scandinavian minimalist look.

41
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,999
And so I decorate
using natural things

42
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:15,999
like dried oranges,
eucalyptus, paperwhites,

43
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,625
and even oranges that
are studded with cloves.

44
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,375
It just is beautiful,
it's very cost-effective,

45
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,250
and it's a natural way
to decorate for the holidays.

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,417
And the best part is
when I'm taking things down,

47
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,999
I can compost everything.

48
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:34,291
So today, I wanna show you
how I make my wreaths.

49
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,999
These are great
to give away as gifts

50
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,208
or just to hang
all over the house

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,417
to celebrate the holiday season.

52
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,999
The first thing
you're gonna do is

53
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,999
you wanna dehydrate your citrus.

54
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,999
Now, you can use oranges,
you can use grapefruit,

55
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,999
or you can use lemons and limes,
whatever your heart desires.

56
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,917
Dehydrating is really easy.

57
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,208
The first step is gonna be

58
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,000
to slice your citrus
as thin as possible.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,041
Once it's all sliced,
put it in your dehydrator.

60
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,500
I prefer a dehydrator
over the oven method.

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,999
It just makes the dehydrated
fruit look better and cleaner.

62
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,999
So you'll dehydrate your fruit.

63
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,999
Just follow the directions
on your dehydrator.

64
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:17,999
I usually do it for eight hours
or even overnight.

65
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,834
When that fruit comes out
of the dehydrator,

66
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,166
it's gonna look beautiful.

67
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,750
It almost has that stained glass
quality to it

68
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,917
that I just love.

69
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,291
So now we're ready
to make our wreaths.

70
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,999
I like to start with eucalyptus.

71
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:35,792
Eucalyptus, you can probably
find it at your farmers market

72
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,000
later on in the season,
Septemberish.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,333
A lot of people grow it here
in the Midwest and all around,

74
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,625
and it's a wonderful,
wonderful plant.

75
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,792
And you can, it dries easy,
so you can use fresh or dried.

76
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,999
I've started using embroidery
hoops as my wreath base,

77
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,999
so I just found these
at my thrift store.

78
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,542
I grabbed different sizes so I
can make different-size wreaths,

79
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,583
and it just makes it fun

80
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,333
and, I don't know,
just a different look.

81
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,583
So I'll start
with my eucalyptus,

82
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,500
and just have two cut here
and I took some leaves off.

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,917
And I'm gonna run some
hot glue on my stems here.

84
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,375
They're gonna look
a little bit messy.

85
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,458
And then I'm just
gonna place my stem

86
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,750
and squeeze it
right onto my hoop.

87
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:24,250
If your fingers aren't burnt
from hot glue,

88
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,583
you're crafting wrong.

89
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,999
And then on my next,
a little bit more glue.

90
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,999
And then I'm just gonna
squeeze that on too.

91
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,000
It's gonna look messy,
but that's all right.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,542
It won't when we're done.

93
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:39,750
And now, I'm just gonna
use my dried citrus here.

94
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,959
I'll put a little glue
on the back

95
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,999
and press it
right onto my wreath,

96
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:50,999
pushing down to just make sure
that it's sticking.

97
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,792
Another orange.

98
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,291
We'll put that right down here.

99
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,625
So it's looking pretty cute.

100
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,750
Right, it's kind of cute.

101
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,166
And then I'm just
gonna add some bells

102
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,208
so it will jingle along
and be in the holiday spirit.

103
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,917
Now, you can add a bow
to this too if you'd like.

104
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,999
I'm not a great bow-tier,
so I don't.

105
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,959
Okay, so how cute are these?

106
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,542
And you can really
make it your own

107
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,999
by adding a few more
decorations.

108
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,041
Even a nice, big red bow
would look really good.

109
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,083
I'm gonna make a few more
of these wreaths

110
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:38,999
to decorate the house with,

111
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,999
and then we're gonna get
our number one decoration,

112
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,208
which is the Christmas tree.

113

I'll see you over

Boy, this is so cozy
inside your cabin.

124
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,999
I haven't been out here
for quite a while.

125
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,625
- Well, welcome.

126
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,999
- Tell me this whole story
about how this started.

127
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,458
- Well, we go back quite a ways.

128
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,999
My husband and I purchased
the property in 1981,

129
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:30,542
and, at that time, it was
a tired, old soybean field.

130
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,999
And we knew that we wanted
to plant something.

131
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,542
And we explored different
plants, different varieties,

132
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,999
and we came across the
Christmas tree industry

133
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,625
and the real Christmas tree
industry,

134
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,583
and decided to start
planting trees.

135
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,583
- So when you say "the real
Christmas tree industry," is it,

136
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,458
I suppose a lot of people think

137
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,458
maybe you can just go out in
the woods and cut down a tree.

138
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,667
What is special about having
a Christmas tree farm?

139
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,500
- The Christmas tree industry
in Wisconsin

140
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,792
and around the country
of the United States is one

141
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,458
that is a managed
agricultural crop.

142
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,208
And unlike a annual crop
such as corn or soybeans,

143
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,959
it takes anywhere
between 10 and 14 years

144
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,750
to produce our crop
of a Christmas tree.

145
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,917
So it's a long-term investment.

146
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,834
- What does the year look like
for a Christmas tree grower?

147
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,999
- The typical year is always
related to the weather.

148
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:19,792
So we typically,

149
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,667
we'll start doing our planting
in the spring and the fall.

150
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:24,999
And those are
taking our seedlings

151
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:27,208
from the time they're
about five years old

152
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,500
when we put them
out into the fields

153
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,333
to the time that a family
will come and harvest them here

154
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,083
at our farm
10 or 14 years later.

155
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,667
- Why is it important
for you to be able

156
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,999
to provide this to folks?

157
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,625
- I think it's something
that Tim and I started

00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,667
and we were novices
at doing this.

160
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,000
We wanted to make sure

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,917
that we were doing something
sound for the environment,

162
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,000
and we wanted to leave
this piece of property,

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
which was being overfarmed,

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,999
as something that
can be looked at

165
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:01,208
in generations when we're gone
as very much improved.

166
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,000
The real Christmas tree
growing operations

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,208
that we do have produced
100% improvement

168
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,750
over this property particular,
in most farms.

169
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,333
We have produced less erosion.

170
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,166
This is sandy soil here
in our part of the world,

171
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:23,208
and keeping the trees on has
definitely reduced the amount

172
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,250
of soil erosion.

173
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,000
It has created a great habitat,

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,709
an amazing habitat
for the birds.

175
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,709
We also feel very, very good
that we're producing something

176
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,291
that's renewable,
that's recyclable.

177
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,000
This is the ultimate
environmental message here.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,458
For every acre of
Christmas trees that are grown,

179
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:44,667
it produces the oxygen for
approximately 18 people per day.

180
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,125
And that is significant for us,

181
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,750
as well as the beauty
of the Christmas tree.

182
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,166
It is the centerpiece
of everyone's holiday.

183
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,709
It's their traditions
and their memories

184
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,417
when they come out here to
celebrate with their families,

185
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:59,917
their individuals,
their friends.

186
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:03,709
They come out here all bundled
up, whatever the weather is,

187
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,667
and either cut their
Christmas tree and select it,

188
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,875
or they select one
that we've cut

189
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,667
and brought up to the cabin
here for them to choose from.

190
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,417
- Therese, thank you so much
for spending time with me today.

191
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,959
And I came to grab
a Christmas tree.

192
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,999
I know that the busy season
is about to start

193
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,333
and you're about to open
to the public,

194
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,542
so would you mind if I
popped out and grabbed one?

195
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,417
- Well, you can pop out
or you can put your coat on.

196
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,417
- [laughing]
I'll bundle up first.

197
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,834
- Therese: And we'll
give you a sled and a saw,

198
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,999
and point you
in the right direction.

199
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,125
- Well, thank you so much,
and Merry Christmas.

200
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,999

I've invited Christl over

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,709
to show me how she makes
her straw ornaments.

206
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,750
Christl, I just love the look
of these ornaments.

207
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,208
They're just gorgeous.

208
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,625
- Christl Iausly: Thank you.

209
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,000
- Now, you come
from a region in Germany

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,999
where this is a very traditional
ornament, is that correct?

211
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,834
- Christl: Yes, that is correct.

212
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:23,375
The Erzgebirge,

213
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:27,000
which is near my hometown,
they invented Christmas.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,542
- Well, you're the
perfect person to teach me then.

215
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,542
[both laughing]

216
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:36,458
How was this even thought of,
using these stems as something

217
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,999
to make into
something beautiful?

218
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,250
- Well, it was something
that was necessary

219
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,000
because we couldn't use
the tops of the wheat.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,999
We couldn't use them because
we needed them to eat.

221
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:48,750
- Right.

222
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,999
- And so we children
just used this

223
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:56,250
and started making the stars
without the hats.

224
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,959
- Wonderful.

225
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,500
So this, you've been
doing this for a while?

226
00:10:59,500 --> 00:10:59,999
- Oh, ja.

227
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:03,375
I was about eight years old
or so when we started,

228
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,792
or six, or something like.

229
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:08,792
I don't think I went to school
already when I did that.

230
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,583
- Well, I would
like you to teach me,

231
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,166
but I'd like you
to have patience with me

232
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,333
'cause I might not be
as crafty as you are.

233
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,208
- Oh, well, I think
you will learn.

234
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,750
[both laughing]
- So what do we start with?

235
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,709
I see you have some straw
in your hand.

236
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:22,208
- Ja.

237
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,834
- And now, these
were soaked, correct?

238
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:25,417
- They were soaked.

239
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:29,375
They have to be soaked in water
for overnight.

240
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,375
If you don't soak them,

241
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,542
they might break in the middle
because they are fragile.

242
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,792
- So soaking 'em, they can
just become more pliable.

243
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:41,542
- Ja, so they're still
somewhat moist now, ja.

244
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:44,583
- And then you can just take
any thread you have, right?

245
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,417
- Any thread you like.

246
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:50,000
You can use colors
that you like or...

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,375
- So how do I start?

248
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:51,999
I've got my...

249
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,875
- And you start on the top
and have your thumb on top.

250
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,333
Ja, over and under.

251
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:58,999
- Over and under.

252
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,250
- And it's a good thing
to do that twice.

253
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,041
- The back.
- Ja, mm-hmm.

254
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:04,709
- So both.

255
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,041
- And then you knot it up;
you knot them together.

256
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,458
- Inga: I could see how this
could be very relaxing too.

257
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,834
- You'll have the one
on top again.

258
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,750
- And then it's a over,
under, over, under.

259
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,458
- Christl: Yes.

260
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,999
Okay, I think you're there,
aren't you?

261
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,166
- Inga: I think I gotta
go right back to here.

262
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,333
Now I'm back to where
I started, right?

263
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,750
- Christl: All right,
lay it down.

264
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,000
- Inga: Lay it down,
and then tie it off again.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,834
- Christl: Tie it up.

266
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,999
You see that these bows
need a little shortening.

267
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:33,500
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,542
- So we kind of decide
to cut 'em all.

269
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:42,583
Okay, leave it long enough
and start here.

270
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,834
Two, see, now it's
under your thumb,

271
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,667
and you can reach the other one.

272
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:52,250
And when you get to the two
again, you already went too far.

273
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,834
I always make two knots.

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,125
But you leave enough
for the hanger

275
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,959
to hang it
onto the Christmas tree.

276
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,792
And we have some samples
that we probably can show.

277
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:06,375
- This is perfect.

278
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,999
I've gotta get in the kitchen
and start cooking.

279
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,999
I'm gonna keep Christl here
to make more decorations for me

280
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,000
while I get cooking.

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,999
How does that sound?

282
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,999

I decided to invite

287
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,583
into the kitchen with me.

288

My mother, Cynthia.

289
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:50,875

to show me

how she's gonna make her
world-famous cheese truffles.

292
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,542
So tell me a little bit
about your truffles, Mom.

293
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,417
- Well, back in the '70s
and '80s,

294
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,999
we all served
a nice cheese ball.

295
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,792
We could buy it at the store,
we could make our own.

296
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,792
And then we went
to the cheese log.

297
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:12,542
And now, I'm making
cheese truffles.

298
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,125
And those are going to be
little cheese balls.

299
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,166
- That seems like it'll
make it easier to eat.

300
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,999
- So we're gonna start
off with eight ounces

301
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,000
of cream cheese,
softened to room temperature.

302

And so she's gonna,
we're just melding this.

303
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:27,500
We are not ever putting this
in the Cuisinart or a blender.

304
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,542
- Would it overmix?

305
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:31,166
- Totally overmix
and turn to mush.

306
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:31,999
And then we're gonna add,

307
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:35,750
you're gonna grate me
a good 1/4 of a pound

308
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,999
of a hard cheese.

309
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,500
- Okay, and I'm gonna use
the cheese I make

310
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,417
here on the farm.

311

So I've got my cream cheese here

312
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,250
and then this is,
I just do a cheddar.

All right, this looks beautiful
going in here.

314
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:46,959
- Cynthia: Isn't
that great colors?

315
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,709
- Inga: Yeah.
- Cynthia: And a small,

316
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,500
you know, the smaller grade
you can do.

317
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,000
- You wouldn't microplane.

318
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,583
- No, no, no.
- No.

319
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,834
- You know, but you
can make long strands

320
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:58,667
or the short strands.

321
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,999
Make a short strand
for the ease of eating.

322
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:08,291
Okay, my secret weapon, Inga,
for this cheese is pepper jelly.

323
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,250
I'm gonna put in about 1/4
of a cup of pepper jelly,

324
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,999
which will give it the sweet
and the spice.

325
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,792
So I'll let you pour that in.

326
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,458
- Inga: All right.

327
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,999
- That is, Inga's doing that
over there.

328
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:25,999
I am going to take about
3/4 of a cup of chopped nuts.

329
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:26,999
I love pecans.

330
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,625
Personally, I would really
like to try cashews.

331
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,667
And then the next ingredient,

332
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,999
we are going to have
Wisconsin cranberries.

333
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:35,542
- All right.

334
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:41,625
- All right, so this goes in
with my nuts over here.

335
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,500
And to finish that,
to give it another kick,

336
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,417
we're going to put in about
1/4 of a cup of chopped chives.

337
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:54,417
And because we're putting these

338
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:59,041
into cheese bites
or truffles, small size,

339
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,999
I'm only giving Inga
1/3 of this bowl.

340
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:07,041
- So I'm gonna incorporate the
1/3 of the mixture she did

341
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,583
into the cream cheese.

342
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,999
So that this, I like this idea

343
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,458
'cause then when
you're biting into it,

344
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,542
you're getting a little filling

345
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,542
and a little crunch
in every bite.

346
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:15,999
- Right.

347
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,959
Now we're gonna start
forming our small truffles.

348
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,458
- Inga: Okay.

349
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,959
- Cynthia: And because we've
added the sweet pepper jelly.

350
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,667
- Inga: Yeah?

351
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,083
- Cynthia: They're
a little loose.

352
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:26,917
- Oh, that's okay.

353
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,999
- And they will get hardened
once in the refrigerator.

354
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:32,917
- They'll set back up nicely.
- But look.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,417
- Inga: I think they look good.

356
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:38,500
- Okay, now you
can try to add...

357
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Look at that, is that nice?

358
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,667
- Then you can pick 'em up
with your little skewer.

359
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,875
- Cynthia: And you can pick 'em
up with your skewer.

360
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,917
- We're gonna finish making
our cheese truffles here,

361
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,792
and then I'm gonna put my mom
to work decorating the tree.

362
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:53,625
And then I need to get my
main course in the oven.

363
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,583
[upbeat acoustic music]

364
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,333
Now that it's the
holiday season,

365
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,166
I've been thinking a lot
about family traditions.

366
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,834
And what is my family tradition?

367
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,500
Really, the only one we have is

368
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,291
to celebrate during the middle
of the day.

369
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,542
I'm a fourth-generation
dairy farmer.

370
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,458
My entire family are farmers,

371
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,875
so we need to eat
between the morning milking

372
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,500
and the evening milking.

373
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,583
With my guests coming today,

374
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,999
we're gonna be eating
about noon, you know,

375
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,083
so we can get back out
to do chores.

376
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,999
The cycle of dairy farming
is never-ending,

377
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,917
but it's always enjoyable.

378
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,208
The other tradition we have
for our family is

379
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:38,417
my folks have been vegetarian
for as long as I can remember,

380
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,500
and it's during the holidays
when we really like

381
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,999
to showcase some really
exquisite vegetarian dishes.

382
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,709
So I want to wow my guests today

383
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:51,625
with a beautiful vegetarian
lunch featuring sweet potatoes.

384
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,999
I'm gonna be making
sweet potato steaks

385
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,750
with a white bean puree.

386
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,792
And then I'm gonna top that
all off with an herbal salad.

387
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,999
So let's get started
with the sweet potatoes.

388
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,999
I'm gonna just slice off the
nose of this sweet potato

389
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,999
and save that for my chickens.

390
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:13,709
And then I'll just slice these
into about half-inch steaks.

391
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,083
I couldn't find a better word
to use than "steaks,"

392
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,542
so that's what I'm calling them.

393
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:23,208
Slice right down the outside
of that sweet potato.

394
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,208
And then watch
your fingers here.

395
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,542
And then cut the others out.

396
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,125
So I'm getting these
really beautiful steaks.

397
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,333
And look at that color--that's
just full of betacarotene.

398
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:37,999
I'll do two.

399
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,875
I'm just gonna cut the tip off
of that one

400
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,999
so that it sits better
on my cutting board.

401
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,583
And now you can just lay
your sweet potatoes out

402
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,999
on a sheet pan
with parchment paper.

403
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,166
Lay them all down.

404
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,834
And then now,
I'm just gonna glaze it

405
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,999
using a maple syrup,
garlic, and butter glaze.

406
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,999
The glaze is very simple
to make.

407
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,999
Alls you need is
a half a cup of maple syrup,

408
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:09,625
half a stick of butter,
and one clove of minced garlic.

409
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:14,834
You'll add that right to a
saucepan and melt it down.

410
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:19,999
And then now, I just glaze
the top of my steaks here.

411
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,291
Now we'll season these
with a little salt and pepper.

412
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,458
[pepper mill grinding]

413
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,125
And now, these will go
into a preheated oven.

414
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,250
I've got my oven set to 375.

415
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,000
These are gonna pop in
for about 20 to 25 minutes,

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,792
just until they're fork tender.

417
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:46,083
Now I'm gonna make a white bean
puree with some rosemary

418
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,375
to top onto the
sweet potato steaks.

419
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,041
And this is really good.

420
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,041
You could use it even just
as a dip with some crackers.

421
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,000
That's how good it is.

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,250
The first thing
I'm gonna do is chop up,

423
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,583
just roughly chop
some fresh rosemary.

424
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,999
I'll pop that right
into my food processor.

425
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:09,709
And then, let's do three cloves
of garlic for this.

426
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,625
I'll pop my garlic
right into the food processor.

427
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,999
[food processor whirring]

428
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,667
Give it a little whirl just
to get that garlic minced up

429
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,125
before I add the rest
of the ingredients.

430
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:30,583
And now I'm gonna add in two
cans of white beans, unrinsed.

431
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,375
And then just give this a blend.

432
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,250
[food processor whirring]

433
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,999
I'm gonna add a little bit
of lemon juice for some acidity.

434
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,041
Probably a half a lemon will do.

435
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,999
A nice glug
of extra virgin olive oil.

436
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,709
And some salt and pepper
just for the seasoning.

437
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,834
[pepper mill grinding]

438
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,959
And then I'll give that
a final puree,

439
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,875
and it'll be ready to go.

440
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,834
[food processor whirring]

441
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,999
The last part of this dish
is gonna be an herb salad.

442
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,125
And I'm gonna start by doing
a homemade salad dressing.

443
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,999
I'm gonna start with a shallot.

444
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,250
[shallot crunching]

445
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,375
And you'll just wanna mince
finely your shallot here.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,166
And that goes
right into my bowl.

447
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,959
And now I'll do
two cloves of garlic,

448
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,750
and these are gonna
be minced as well.

449
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,917
And then that goes right
into my bowl as well.

450
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:42,083
And now I'm gonna add salt
and pepper to the bowl.

451
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,750
A little bit of Dijon mustard.

452
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,458
And then I like
to use a sweetener,

453
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,999
like a honey or a maple syrup.

454
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,333
I have a friend
who keeps bees on my farm,

455
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,625
so I have lots of honey,

456
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,041
so I'm gonna use that
in my dressing.

457
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,250
Okay, this looks good.

458
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,625
I'm gonna add a little bit
of lemon again for that acidity.

459
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,375
The rule of thumb is, I believe,

460
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,333
two parts oil
to one part vinegar

461
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,999
when you're making
your salad dressing.

462
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,834
But the best advice I can
give you is taste as you go

463
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,458
and adjust as needed.

464
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:18,125
You could also use a sherry
vinegar, red wine vinegar.

465
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,875
Any kind of acidity like that
would work well here.

466
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,208
And then a little bit
of extra virgin olive oil

467
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,875
that I bring out
for occasions like these

468
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,834
or if I'm making a
really delicate salad.

469
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,250
Now I'm gonna add some herbs.

470
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,208
I'm adding dill,
cilantro, and parsley.

471
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,875
I like the way
the three work together,

472
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:42,000
and they're gonna complement
the sweet potatoes very nicely.

473
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,999
I'm trying to chop
everything uniformly

474
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:48,999
so when you're eating it,
it feels nice on your palate.

475
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,417
Stir that in nicely.

476
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,999
And now I'm gonna add
a little bit of crunch

477
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,000
with some walnuts.

478
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,917
I might chop these up a bit,
just a handful of walnuts.

479
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,291
And then I'm gonna add
a little bit of feta.

480
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,625
The feta cheese goes nicely
with this.

481
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,999
It's a nice salty cheese.

482
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:07,999
And then some really
beautiful pomegranate seeds,

483
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:11,041
since it's the season
of pomegranates

484
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:15,750
and they look really festive
and holiday in this dish.

485
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:17,999
And now we can plate it up.

486
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:21,000
The best part about this recipe
is you can serve it

487
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,999
at room temperature or warm,

488
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,959
so it goes well
with entertaining.

489
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,999
You don't have to kind of try
to plan everything

490
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,083
around when your guests
are sitting at the table,

491
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,999
making sure everything's warm
getting to the table.

492
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,667
That's why I love this recipe.

493
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,542
So I've got my sweet potatoes
there,

494
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,291
and I'm gonna add a little bit
of the bean puree

495
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,709
to the top of the potatoes.

496
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,125
And then I'll add my salad
right on top.

497
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:48,999
And maybe a few more
pomegranates here

498
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,792
just to make it look festive.

499
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,375
And a bit of cheese.

500
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,166
And now,
we're ready for a party.

501
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,542
I'm a big fan of thrifting,
garage saleing,

502
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,709
finding little treats
here and there.

503
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,417
And I love to decorate my table

504
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,999
using all of my
really fun finds.

505
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,625
And when I set my table,

506
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:15,458
I love the idea of mismatched
glassware, mismatched dishes,

507
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,500
and just using what
you have on hand.

508
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,834
I decided to have my
cheese board run right down

509
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,000
to the middle of the table.

510
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,083
I love going to holiday parties

511
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,333
and sampling all different kinds
of cheese and charcuterie.

512
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,999
But the problem is, is then
when you get to the table,

513
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:32,208
you have to leave the cheese
plate at the appetizer table.

514
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,792
So I wanted to bring everything
right to our lunch here.

515
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,999
So I just put down a layer
of parchment paper

516
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,999
and then built my cheeseboard
right on top of that.

517
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:45,667
I also love the idea when
it comes to holiday giving,

518
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,083
if we can start giving anything

519
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,959
that kind of can come
from the heart.

520
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,041
I think we should be
shopping less at stores

521
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:55,417
and showing more appreciation
to our host or hostesses

522
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,500
through a homemade gift.

523
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,333
I think everything's ready.

524
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,999
I'm gonna invite my friends
to the table.
