Or, "Good idea.

There's no way
we're gonna do that."

I really wanted to see

if we can popularize
African cuisine

62
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,999
and sort of get it
into people's consciousness.

63
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,166
- Yaw: That hit a sweet spot

64
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,333
because I've always said
within the community,

65
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,999
we should be offering our foods
outside of our community.

66
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,999
It is excellent food.
It's wonderful food.

67
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,500
- Ghana's lively
street food scene

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,999
held many possibilities.

69
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,208
Yaw found inspiration
in his childhood memories

70
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,375
of a favorite candy snack.

71
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,375
- Yaw: Nkatie cake in Ghana,

72
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,625
which just literally means
"peanut cake."

73
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:56,709
It's a form of brittle,
Ghana-style brittle.

74
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,709
I went into the kitchen,
I played around

75
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,083
with the formulation
and all that kind of stuff

76
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:02,875
for the brittle

77
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,667
and started giving it
to family and friends,

78
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,333
saying,
"Hey, this is pretty good.

79
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,458
"You should try it out.

80
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,083
Let me know what you think."

81

that, I go, [snaps fingers]

Yaw, this is it.

83
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,999
- The kitchen experiments
resulted in

84
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,417
Sharay's Ghana-style Brittle,

85
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:21,917
using Yaw's childhood nickname.

86
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,250
The duo
introduced the product

87
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,917
at farmers' markets
in the Fox Valley.

88
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,917
- It's the not-too-sweet

89
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:33,125
nutty treat
that doesn't stick
to your teeth.

90
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,125
- Mm, superb.

91
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,000
- Orson: One of the beautiful
things about this area

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,291
was that people
were just so welcoming

93
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,375
of the idea
and of us.

94
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,875
And that gave us the confidence,
"Okay, if we can do it

95
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,291
on our home market,
well, we can do this
everywhere."

96
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,000
- Doing it everywhere,
like grocery stores

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,999
and specialty shops,
means scaling up,

98
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:58,333
an expansion that meant
increased production.

99
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,999
The solution?

100
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,166
Buy the candy shop

101
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,500
where they had contracted
for small production runs.

102
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:10,208
So, Yaw and Orson are like
two kids in a candy shop.

103
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,875
- Yaw: Ghana-style brittle,

104
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,041
very different
from your traditional brittle.

105
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,625
It's easy
to bite into.

106
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,999
You get
rich nut flavor.

107
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,333
- It's a story
that Orson sees as worthy

108
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,583
of the Marvel movies
he and Yaw love to watch,

109
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,083
and nearly as improbable.

110
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,458
- Orson: It's like,
this thing shouldn't exist.

111
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,999
But yet,
I'm watching it.

112
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,041
It almost feels like

113
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,375
this is what we're doing
with our immigrant experience

114
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,667
and the business,
it shouldn't really exist,

115
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,041
but yet,
you're living it.

116
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,166
- Brittle is
just the beginning.

117
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,291
The start of a vision

118
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,333
of sharing beloved treats
from West Africa,

119
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,875
in Wisconsin,
and beyond.

120
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,999
- We really wanna get
a line of West African snacks

121
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,875
that we can put out there
for people to go ahead

122
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,999
and try and enjoy.

123
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:56,917
- What do you think?

124
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,166
- I think it's pretty good.

125
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
- I love that reaction.

126
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,625
- So, I wanted to showcase

127
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,709
that something good
comes from Africa.

128
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,000
And that's kind
of like the story

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,999
that I've been
trying to tell.
