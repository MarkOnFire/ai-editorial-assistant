00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,970
[grunts]
- Barrett Klein: Take one.

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,972
- Producer: And then try
talking about it.

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,208
- Orthoptera, Diptera,
Lepidoptera,

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,944
Hymenoptera, Trichoptera.

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,349
Notice they all end
in "optera," Greek for "wing."

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,684
Coleoptera, beetles.

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,153
From a weevil
to a ground beetle.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,591
Here, we've got burying beetles
and other carrion beetles.

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,594
Goliath beetle, the most
massive insect on the planet.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,096
Insects.

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:34,835
The grand diversity, variety,
not only in shape, color, form,

12
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:39,473
but behavior has always
inspired and excited me.

13
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:45,012
I'm Barrett Klein,
entomologist, entomoartist,

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,748
animal behaviorist,
and professor of biology

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,485
at University
of Wisconsin-La Crosse.

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,220
[quirky music]

17
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,525
I like to share my food
with the roaches.

18
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,861
Let's see.

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,597
Now, they love bananas.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,567
Chowing down!

21
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:14,908
So it's tempting to swat, slap,
and dismiss or repel insects.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,646
- Advertiser: Flying insect
killer: kills bugs dead.

23
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:23,684
- It takes a little bit
more effort to observe,

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,988
not just tolerate, but
celebrate insect involvement

25
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,723
in our lives.

26
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:35,629
Pollination, decomposition,
nutrient dispersal,

27
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,364
soil aeration.

28
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,534
Our lives depend on them.

29
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,137
Let's find that
winner of a drawer.

30
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,039
Hey, what are they doing here?

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,608
Excuse me.

32
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,211
When I was five years old,
I found a dead butterfly

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,815
on my parents' driveway,
and I was thrilled

34
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:59,753
because to a child, to well,
to anybody with open eyes

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,191
and an open mind,
the beauty was exhilarating.

36
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:09,062
I could hold that accessible,
exquisite organism,

37
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,333
and I felt really privileged.

38
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,071
And I knew at that point,
I had this nebulous epiphany

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,643
that insects would be
at the core of my existence.

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,812
So, when I was asked
to write a book,

41
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,315
I titled it
<i>The Insect Epiphany</i>

42
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:32,653
because every day,
there's a new epiphany

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,923
as to how insects
influence our lives.

44
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,860
Cultural entomology,

45
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,298
or how insects have affected
human culture across the world

46
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,700
and throughout history.

47
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,735
[groovy music]

48
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,307
On this table, you see insects
in comic books,

49
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,944
and then stamps
from across the world.

50
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,680
Products like cochineal.

51
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:04,084
The dried bodies can form this
lustrous red.

52
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,087
Entomophagy, the eating
of insects.

53
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:11,258
High in calories, as well as
micronutrients and protein.

54
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:16,163
Pupae, crickets, grasshoppers,
mealworms, larvae.

55
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,367
From Korea, we've got
silkworm moth pupae.

56
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,369
Not my highest recommendation.

57
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,137
Insects as costumes.

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,307
Here's my sketchbook
designing that number.

59
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:32,279
So when Halloween comes up,
I must have an insect helmet.

60
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:36,049
A bald-faced hornet nest
with entrance as the mouth,

61
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,953
and a gaping hole
revealing a brood cone.

62
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,026
Paper wasp helmet,
silk tunic and wings,

63
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,931
cochineal sleeves,
paper chest shield.

64
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,233
- Producer: Why, why,
why do you do it?

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,968
[Barrett laughs]

66
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,741
My reason for involving insects,

67
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:08,048
it affords me a greater intimacy
with the arthropods I love.

68
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,919
But also, I find art
is an easy, fun,

69
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,191
often inspiring way
to communicate

70
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,361
to fellow humans
the value of insects.

71
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:30,404
To explore this intimate
connection we have with insects,

72
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,707
that's what's really
exciting to me.

73
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,442
