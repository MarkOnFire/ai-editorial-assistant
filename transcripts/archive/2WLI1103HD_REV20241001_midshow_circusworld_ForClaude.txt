1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:00,999
[shimmery music]

2
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:02,875
- I'm having a blast
at Circus World

3
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:06,166
while trapezing through the
historic treasures found here.

4
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:09,208
[whistle blowing]

5
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:12,333
- Ringleader:
Welcome to Circus World!

6
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,875
[circus music]

7
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,709
- Come one, come all

8
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,041
to enjoy camels,

9
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:19,875
clowns,

10
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,999
and a human cannonball
[cannon pops]

11
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,999
here at Circus World.

12
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,709
To learn a bit more
about the history here,

13
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,709
I met up with Scott O'Donnell,

14
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,500
who wasn't
clowning around...

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,041
just yet.

16
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,999
- Scott O'Donnell: So, we opened
July 1st, 1959, to celebrate

17
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,999
the state of Wisconsin's
vibrant circus heritage.

18
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,999
We're here in Baraboo
because it was the hometown

19
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:42,999
of the Ringling Bros.,

20
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:46,792
who started their circus here
in 1884,

21
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:47,792
and their personal attorney,

22
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:50,583
John M. Kelly,
at the tender age of 93,

23
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,417
decided that this state

24
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,875
needed to celebrate
its vibrant circus heritage.

25
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:55,834
- So, would you say Wisconsin

26
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,208
has been the lead contributor,
historically,

27
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,999
to circuses around the nation?
- Without a doubt!

28
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,875
It's been the incubator
and the cultural epicenter

29
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,083
for this art form
that has been around

30
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,709
as part
of the American experience

31
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,083
longer than Coca-Cola,
the Kentucky Derby,

32
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:09,999
and baseball
in America.

33
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,750
Really, if you take the map,
and you throw a dart at it,

34
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,875
you're gonna get on it
really close to a town

35
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,125
where a circus came from
in this great state.

36
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,999
- So, connect us
to what that means

37
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:19,999
when we come
to Circus World.

38
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:20,999
Like, what should I expect
to experience?

39
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:25,417
- Scott O'Donnell:
Well, 64 acres
of a living history museum.

40
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,083
<i>The Big Top Show
</i> is our signature piece,

41
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:28,875
where you get to sit

42
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,875
under a big, billowing,
red and white big top tent,

43
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,125
as people have done
for generations in America,

44
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,083
and it's filled to the gills
with talent.

45
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,208
We have singing ringmasters
and funny clowns.

46
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,667
We have daring aerialists
which are 40 feet up in the air.

47
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,999
We have jugglers and acrobats
and contortionists,

48
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:48,667
and some amazing animal partners
with us, as well.

49
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,250
But there's
six other performances

50
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,250
outside of the<i>Big Top Show,</i>

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,999
plus seven buildings
to explore,

52
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,250
filled to the gills
with the largest collection

53
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,291
of circus artifacts and ephemera
in the entire world.

54
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,208
So there's lots to do,
whether you're three to 103.

55
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,333
You got a full day
here at Circus World.

56
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,750
- A full day traveling
through what is known

57
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,542
as "the greatest show on earth,"

58
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,999
all while learning about
Wisconsin's rich circus history.
