[groovy music]

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,276
- Ian Thomson: Mile of Music
is very artist focused

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,611
and community forward.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,447
We pride ourselves on taking
care of the artists 100%

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,116
from the time we initially
make contact with them

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,752
all the way through
'til when they leave.

7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,889
- Jake Cochran: From the moment
we booked it to getting on site,

8
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,824
we feel really taken care of.

9
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,226
The logistics are super smooth
and easy.

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,096
There's a sign-up sheet
for a free massage.

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,099
There's amazing food ready
for us anytime we want it.

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,068
It's a pretty prime place to be.

13
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,804
- Mac Inglis: There's an
artist care program here

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,406
that includes things
ranging from dental care

15
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:43,911
to chiropractic care to massages
to tons of free food.

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,180
- Jeff Gorman: Getting some
hearing tests,

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,715
even being able to get
your hair cut,

18
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,852
those are things that you
just never really have access to

19
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,687
at a lot of festivals.

20
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,355
- Regina Strayhorn: We
enthusiastically signed up

21
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,657
for a dental appointment.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,659
- Sydney Shepherd: Yeah, we're
all going to the dentist

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,927
tomorrow.
- And massage therapy.

24
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
- Vanessa Wilbourn: I had my
ears tested today.

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,599
She is not going deaf,
grateful for that.

26
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,401
- Max Niemann: I went to the
chiropractor earlier

27
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,569
on the company dime.

28
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,470
We're playing with house money
tonight, baby.

29
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,472
- Mike Savino: I'd say
we feel very appreciated here.

30
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,875
- Josiah Wolf: That's what I had
heard about the festival before.

31
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,877
That's all I heard
about it was free health care.

32
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,679
My friend who was here,
he's like, "Oh, man,

33
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,614
"you could get a massage
and your eyes checked

34
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,983
and your ears,
get custom earplugs."

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,220
I'm like,
"Oh, that sounds nice."

36
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,021
- Tracy McNeil: We got our
hearing checked today,

37
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,358
and we got, like,
free molded ear plugs

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,393
that are gonna be
shipped out to us.

39
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,661
It's really cool,
it's really cool.

40
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,463
And they really look after you.

41
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,665
It's such a great vibe.
