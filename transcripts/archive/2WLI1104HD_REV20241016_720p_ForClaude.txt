as we attend the
Northern Wisconsin State Fair.

The expansive fairgrounds

have been a community staple
for more than 120 years.

[strumming ukulele]

It's a rich history

37

that included
agricultural exhibits,

38
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:38,792

- Anja Notanja Sieger:
Listening.

64
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,750
Writing is listening,
if you do it well.

[Angela clears throat,

68
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,917
Good writing
is all about listening.

69
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,291
- Anja: Listening not only
for what they need to hear,

70
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,834
but also just listening
to what they're saying.

71
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,583
- Angela: It's about zeroing in

72
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,625
and reflecting on
what's around you.

73
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,959
- Anja: People need to hear
what they are thinking

mirrored back to them,

75

and too often,
people aren't getting that.

76
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,834
But I don't really know
what I'm talking about.

Okay then,
let's try this once more.

[advancing paper in typewriter]

[carriage return]

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,999
Introducing Anja.

83
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,792
She's been writing stories
since she could draw.

84
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,041
- I've always was just
one of those kids that...

85
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,125
would draw a picture,

86
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,542
and the picture
would have a story.

87
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,625
And so, even before
I could write, I'd be like,

88
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,667
"Mom, Mom,
write down this story!

89
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,583
This is,
this is what this is about."

90
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,625
And that's just
how I've always been.

91
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,917
- Later, drawing
would segue into typing,

92
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,500
lots of typing.

93

Anja creates poetry
on the spot,

96
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,250
setting up a typewriter

97
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,000
at festivals, fairs, and
craft shows around Wisconsin,

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,999
and charging a fee

99
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,083
to write personalized
poems or stories.

100
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,667
- Anja: I generally give people

101
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,834
a very thorough
interview process

102
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,250
where I want to know...

103
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
what they
need to hear right now

104
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,458
or who is it going to
and why?

105
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,999
And why does that person
make them a better person?

106
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:35,083
Or how is their dog different
from all other dogs?

107
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,291
You know, I get in there
with people.

108
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,834
- One of
her first poems

109
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,999
featured
a dash of romance

110
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,792
and a whole lot
of awkwardness.

111
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:49,166
[playful brass instruments]

112
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,959
- A guitar player,
who was a busker,

113
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,000
came up to me,

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,999
and he wanted a love poem.

115
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,291
And I think
he was hitting on me,

116
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,999
but I wrote him one
because I needed the money.
[laughs]

117
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:05,709
[typing]

118
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,500
- For others, a dash of romance
might shift to love.

119
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,125
- I remember this one couple;

120
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,999
they wanted me to write
their marriage vows.

121
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,458
So, I did.

122
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,792
And then, I put it
in an envelope.

123
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,250
And then, they're like,
"Seal it.

124
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,083
"We don't want to see it.

125
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:26,291
We want it to be a surprise
during the wedding ceremony."

126
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:30,999
And I was just like,
"Okay, all right, enjoy!

127
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,083
It'll be very entertaining."
[snickers]

128
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,875
- While entertaining,

129
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,375
there is pressure involved.

130
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,625
- Yeah,
no, there's no delete key.

131
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,917
But in this day and age,

132
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,458
that's magic

133
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,208
because
we have Photoshop,

134
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,999
we have
Artificial Intelligence,

135
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,166
but here I am

136
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:56,208
giving you
an authentic artifact.

137
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,166
Perhaps
there will be some flaws,

138
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,999
just like I am flawed,
and you are flawed,

139
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,250
and it's okay.

140
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,667
It's interesting.

141
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,709
- It's helping people
articulate those flaws

142
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,208
that brings Anja
the most satisfaction.

143
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,542
- I feel like
I'm doing a good thing

144
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,999
when I'm writing
for people

145
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,333
who are going through
a difficult time

146
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,166
or struggling
with anxiety.

147
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,999
I mean,
a lot of times,

148
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,709
I'm stepping
into a role

149
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,083
that, like,
therapists offer,

150
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,542
but I am an artist,
and so,

151
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:37,875
I'm giving them therapeutic
art, and that feels good.

152
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,458
- Anja, although
an expert writer,

153
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,291
has come to a somewhat
nonexpert conclusion

154
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,834
about herself.

155
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:50,750
- Anja: Every single time
I write a poem for someone

156
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,166
who's asking
for something,

157
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:57,000
there's always a chance
I'm gonna fail.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,041
There's always a chance

159
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,999
they're not gonna like
what I write.

160
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,917
There's always a risk.

161
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:03,999
And I think

162
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:08,792
there's something

In 1932, there was no money

An important step
to their preservation.

475
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,500
- Leah: It's really hard
to convince people

476
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,250
that they should have
these horses

477
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,500
if they don't see them
riding and doing things.

478
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,208
- Em: They don't just belong
in museums, right?

479
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,709
They don't just belong
in a history book.

480
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,959
We need to make sure that
there's a future for them, too.

the Humble Horse herd

482
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,917
have become ambassadors
for the breed.

483
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:30,709
A visit to the River Falls
campus, near Em's office,

484
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,125
provided welcome relief
during a stressful semester.

485
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,875
- Em: Maybe you can call it
"multi-species social work."
[laughs]

486
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,041
- Whatever you call it,
the Humble Horse

487
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:45,208
is making a difference
for people and ponies.

488
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,667
- Em: I'm not an owner.

489
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,834
I don't own these horses,
but I caretake for them

490
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:51,750
And I'm lucky enough
to do so.

author
Robert Root

495
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,709
overcomes
his fears

496
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,166

498
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,375

[strumming acoustic instrument]

500
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:12,500
- Robert Root: I'm the only one
signed up for the cave tour

501
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,750
at the Ledge View Nature Center,
but Jane Mingari,

502
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,333
the Assistant Naturalist,
agrees to lead it.

503
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,125
Despite a fear
of tight, dark places,

504
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,667
I'd resolved
to explore a cave.

505
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,709
Now, I have no excuse
to back out.

506
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,000
We walk to the entrance
on the roofs of caves.

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,750
Jane explains how
the solution caves below us

508
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,792
were carved by seepage
of rain and snowmelt

509
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,166
that sometimes became
underground streams

510
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,542
and even waterfalls.

511
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,625
The ground beneath us
is honeycombed

512
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,999
with chambers and channels.

513
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:49,375
The Carolyn's Caverns
cave system

514
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,792
is over 700 feet long.

515
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,999
It's accessible part
of the year for tours,

516
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,667
but closed from October to May
for bat hibernation.

Its first room,
the Bat Room,

521
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:12,125
has an opening in its steel door
for bats--

522
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,750
big brown, little brown,

523
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,417
long-eared,
and tri-colored bats--

524
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,000
to enter and exit.

525
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,999
Jane urges me to explore
two side rooms.

526
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:26,083
I smile gamely and commit myself
to crawling and clambering.

527
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,999
I squirm on my belly in and out
of one narrow passage...

528
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,834
[water dripping, clambering]

529
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:36,041
and climb down a ladder
into a small, enclosed space

530
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,583
with a muddy bottom.

531
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,500
I hope I've acclimated myself
to what's ahead.

532
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,583
We wander through
other rooms and passages,

533
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,291
stepping carefully
on the uneven floor,

534
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,792
wary of protrusions
near our heads.

535
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,125
I bend, I stoop,

536
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,417
I crawl on my hands and knees,

537
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:55,709
and I slither outright.

538
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,709
Only one space
is especially tight--

539
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,125
less so for Jane
than for me.

540
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,959
But crawling through passages
like the Whale's Throat

541
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,709
and the Kid's Passage

542
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,500
means venturing
into long, dark holes

543
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,333
with no chance
to raise my head

544
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,999
or propel myself
by any means other

545
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,166
than elbows and thighs.

546
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,250
I try not to think about
getting stuck

547
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,875
and soon realize
I don't need to think about it.

548
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,917
When we descend
to Carolyn's Cave,

the original entrance
to the system,

550
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,834
we're 17 feet
below the surface.

551
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,750
At the bottom of Dave's Sink,
the deepest room,

552
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,208
we're 36 feet, four stories,
underground.

[dripping,

At times, bending to look down
a dark passage,

555
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,625
I feel the lure
of crawling in to see

556
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,542
just how far
it would take me,

557
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:53,458
how tangled and interconnected
the cavities might be.

Jane illuminates layers
of Silurian strata--

and miniature stalactites.

She steers me around

00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,999
the sticky pools
on the cave floors.

[sloppy sucking sounds]

Despite the weight
of the rock strata above me,

00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,041
the density of the walls
around me,

When we reach daylight,
I feel no sense of relief.

I suppose
you could say

571
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,999
I confronted my fear
of crawling in caves

572
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,625
and overcame it.

573
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,750
It seems to me
more likely

574
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,250
that I was too absorbed
in where I was

575
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,041
to notice my fear.
