1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,037
- Samantha Mulrooney: All right,
hello, everybody.

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,974
Thank you for joining us
here tonight.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,510
Welcome to those of you
here in the building

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:13,013
and to those of you
joining us online.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,816
This is
our Crossroads of Ideas:

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,951
"Alzheimer's and the Gut-Brain
Superhighway."

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,954
So, this is the second part
of our three-part miniseries

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,723
on the microbiome.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,891
My name is Sam Mulrooney.

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,459
I am the outreach
program manager

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,662
for WID, Wisconsin
Alumni Research Foundation.

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,531
Sorry, oh, my gosh.

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,634
Wisconsin Institute
for Discovery

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,304
and the director of the
Wisconsin Science Festival.

15
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,940
The Crossroads of Ideas
is a collaboration

16
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,909
between the Wisconsin Institute
for Discovery,

17
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,544
the Morgridge Institute
for Research,

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,313
and the UW-Madison
Strategic Communications.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,215
It's an opportunity
to foster dialogue

20
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,385
between the community
and UW-Madison researchers.

21
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,921
The series addresses issues
that matter to all of us

22
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,757
and are also the subject
of research at UW-Madison.

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,358
Since 2014,

24
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,061
Crossroads has been a staple
of public programming offered

25
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,665
at the Discovery Building
on UW-Madison's campus.

26
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,401
So, before I say a little bit
more about this evening's event,

27
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,269
we'll take a moment
to acknowledge the land

28
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,638
that we occupy here
at the Discovery Building.

29
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,808
The Wisconsin Institute
for Discovery at UW-Madison

30
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,477
acknowledges that it
occupies the ancestral lands

31
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,748
of the Ho-Chunk Nation, known as
Dejope, which means four lakes.

32
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,618
The Ho-Chunk have stewarded
this land and its waterways,

33
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,087
Mendota, Monona, Waubesa,
and Kegonsa

34
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,922
since time immemorial,

35
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,392
maintaining deep cultural,
economic, and spiritual ties.

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,961
We honor their sovereignty

37
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,196
and the shared strength
of standing together

38
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,966
with all First Nations
of Wisconsin.

39
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,467
Thank you.

40
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,237
So, tonight, we are here
to continue the journey

41
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,005
of this exciting
three-part miniseries,

42
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,173
like I mentioned,

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,442
featuring the
gut-brain superhighway

44
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,512
and the complex interplay
between gut microbes

45
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,846
and brain health.

46
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,215
So, we have two wonderful
researchers here with us tonight

47
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,650
to help us dig into this topic,

48
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:00,187
Dr. Barb Bendlin
and Dr. Federico Rey.

49
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,588
They will each take
a few minutes

50
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,390
to talk about their work,
and then we'll finish

51
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,558
with a shared conversation

52
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,493
and time at the end
for audience Q&A.

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,698
So, as a quick introduction
to both of our presenters today,

54
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,367
Dr. Bendlin is a faculty member

55
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,769
in the Division
of Geriatrics and Gerontology

56
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,938
within the Department
of Medicine.

57
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,307
She is a member of the Wisconsin
Alzheimer's Institute's

58
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,475
Executive Committee

59
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,777
and the Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center

60
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,847
executive committee, leads
the research education component

61
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,283
in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center,

62
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,251
and directs
the UW-Madison Neuroscience

63
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,487
and Public Policy Program.

64
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,722
Dr. Bendlin is a recipient
of the 2019

65
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,491
Distinguished Honors
Faculty Award

66
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,092
and is an associate editor

67
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,495
of <i>The Journal</i>
<i>of Alzheimer's Disease.</i>

68
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,898
Dr. Federico Rey started
his independent research program

69
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,835
in bacteriology
at UW-Madison in 2013.

70
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,337
A major focus of his group
is to understand

71
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,940
how variations in the
gut microbiome composition

72
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,808
modulate the effects of diet

73
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,678
and the host's susceptibility
to cardiometabolic

74
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,379
and cognitive diseases.

75
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,014
The contributions from his team

76
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,616
are helping move the field
from associations

77
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,284
to causal relationships

78
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,919
and shedding light
on the mechanisms

79
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,622
by which gut microbes
modulate health.

80
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,890
So, with that,

81
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,426
please welcome first
to the stage Dr. Barb Bendlin.

82
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,728
[audience applauding]

83
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,667
- Dr. Barbara Bendlin:
Thank you, Samantha,

84
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,169
and welcome, everyone.

85
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,372
It's wonderful to see
some old friends in the audience

86
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,541
and new friends as well.

87
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,611
I'll be talking today about some
of our work

88
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,947
in aging
and Alzheimer's disease.

89
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:38,819
But I wanted to start off by
just talking a little bit about

90
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:44,825
Élie Metchnikoff, going back
in history to the early 1900s.

91
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,361
He was a Russian zoologist

92
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,766
and is well-known for his
pioneering work in immunology.

93
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:57,171
So, he found an immune cell
called a phagocyte,

94
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,742
and he won the Nobel Prize
in Physiology and Medicine

95
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,610
for his discovery.

96
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,146
But what else
is interesting about him

97
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,784
is that he was interested
in aging and longevity,

98
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,287
and he noticed
that there were some individuals

99
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,789
in Eastern Europe
who lived to be very old,

100
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,624
who were centenarians,

101
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,695
and he was curious
about what factors led them

102
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,897
to live to this old age.

103
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,701
And he noticed that they ate
a lot of fermented foods

104
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,003
and that they
were consuming yogurt.

105
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,706
So, he himself started to,

106
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,711
with his interest in microbes
and interest in immune function,

107
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,949
he started to eat a lot
of fermented foods, sour milk,

108
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,017
yogurt, and in fact,

109
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:48,388
he had this theory that if you
ate these microbial-rich foods

110
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,892
that potentially,
they crowd out toxins.

111
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,595
And he believed it to the extent
that when there was

112
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:59,466
a cholera epidemic,
he actually consumed cholera

113
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,436
to see what the effect
would be on him.

114
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,171
And he survived it.

115
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,473
And he had this idea that

116
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,811
the good bugs were
potentially protecting people

117
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,546
against bad bugs.

118
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,517
And so, he was interested
in longevity.

119
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,820
He actually coined
the term gerontology.

120
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,122
And I just thought this was
such an interesting story,

121
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,859
because I'm also interested
in aging

122
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,963
and diseases
that increase with aging.

123
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,000
It's kind of this idea
between microbes

124
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,369
and aging and immune function
is really something

125
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:40,741
that myself and my colleagues
are interested in as well.

126
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,277
So, I study Alzheimer's disease,

127
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,513
and the key
pathological features

128
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,349
you see in Alzheimer's,
we're looking at them

129
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,519
here actually under the
microscope in a human brain.

130
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,589
So, on the left,
we have beta amyloid plaques.

131
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:59,259
And on the right,
we have neurofibrillary tangles.

132
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,629
We see these
when somebody comes to autopsy

133
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,198
who has Alzheimer's dementia,

134
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,100
but we can actually see these
in living people as well

135
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,002
using brain imaging.

136
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,005
We can also use
cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

137
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,175
And, most recently,
we can even find out

138
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:19,980
if someone has these pathologies
using a blood sample.

139
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,982
When we're thinking
about factors

140
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,786
that contribute
to aging, healthy aging,

141
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,521
or risk for disease,

142
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,891
we know that
human genetics plays a role.

143
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,461
However, there's also another
idea beyond just genomics,

144
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,397
and that's the idea
of the exposome,

145
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,132
or all of those exposures

146
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,034
that we have over the course
of our lives,

147
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,805
from when we're in utero
until we're in old age.

148
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,174
And we know
that those also have an impact

149
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,009
on our health outcomes.

150
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,579
In fact, even there's been
cases of identical twins

151
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,781
who have the exact same genetics

152
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,151
where one individual develops
Alzheimer's disease dementia,

153
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:02,122
but the other person does not
or develops it much later.

154
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,191
So, when we think about some
of those factors,

155
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,694
some of those exposures,
those can include things

156
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,364
like the environments
that we live in,

157
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,666
the jobs that we work at,

158
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,202
perhaps
how much sleep we're getting,

159
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,472
whether we smoke cigarettes,
et cetera.

160
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,040
So, there's all these kinds
of things

161
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,676
that happen in our daily lives

162
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,412
that can influence our risk
for disease.

163
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,916
And microbial exposures can be
another one of those things

164
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,051
that are part of the exposome.

165
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,421
So, those could be viruses
that we're exposed to.

166
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,756
For example,

167
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,159
there's quite a large literature
on herpes simplex virus

168
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,295
and whether that impacts
the brain.

169
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,630
The jury is still out on that,

170
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:48,368
but also potentially
Lyme disease or coronavirus.

171
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,472
We do know that coronavirus,
for example, impacts the brain.

172
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,843
Some of these other
so-called lifestyle factors

173
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,179
may also operate
through the microbiome.

174
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:03,884
So, for example, what we eat
impacts the gut microbiome,

175
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,621
or for individuals who work
and are exposed to pesticides,

176
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:12,459
that could deplete the healthy
microbes in and on their body.

177
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,428
So, the microbiome,

178
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,164
when we're talking
about the human microbiome,

179
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:20,534
that's all the microbes
in and on our body.

180
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,569
Most of them are in the gut.

181
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,472
And sometimes we think about
microbes as being pathogenic,

182
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,107
but often they're benign,

183
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,743
and very often
they're also beneficial.

184
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,013
And we know that in individuals
with disease,

185
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,748
they can be different.

186
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,452
And we've been really interested
in understanding

187
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,354
whether microbes
are different

188
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,691
between people with and without
Alzheimer's disease.

189
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,660
So, about 10 years ago,

190
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,463
I started working
with my friend and colleague

191
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,466
Federico Rey in bacteriology,

192
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,602
and he had done
some pioneering studies showing

193
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,273
that the gut microbiome
is not only different

194
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,910
in disease states,
but using animal models,

195
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,381
he showed that certain microbes
might even drive disease

196
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,383
or health outcomes,

197
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,786
and he was working in obesity
and Type 2 diabetes.

198
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,122
So, we started a project to see

199
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,991
whether the gut microbiome
was different

200
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,593
in Alzheimer's disease.

201
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,928
And potentially,

202
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,797
could we figure out what
the mechanisms might be linking

203
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:28,435
the gut and brain
in neurodegenerative disease?

204
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,572
So, how do we do this?

205
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,373
In Wisconsin,

206
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,544
we have actually very
wonderful research participants

207
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:41,081
who join our studies,
who undergo brain imaging

208
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,418
so we can see if they have
that pathological protein

209
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,020
associated
with Alzheimer's disease.

210
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,024
They undergo MRI,
positron emission tomography,

211
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,860
cognitive testing.

212
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,629
Many of them
undergo lumbar puncture.

213
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,098
So, I'm showing you
a participant here

214
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,267
whose permission
we have to show this.

215
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,469
The reason why we take
the cerebrospinal fluid

216
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,004
is because it bathes the brain.

217
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,342
And we can see proteins
related to Alzheimer's disease.

218
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:13,013
But perhaps their greatest
contribution has been stool.

219
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,617
So, in order to study
the gut microbiome,

220
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,353
we can actually look at stool,

221
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,622
because everything
that's in the gut

222
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,891
eventually comes out
in the stool.

223
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,993
So, we added this as a procedure

224
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,530
so that we could look at the
gut microbiome in people

225
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,466
either with Alzheimer's disease
dementia

226
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,968
or without
Alzheimer's disease dementia.

227
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:39,573
We also had participants
who were actually asymptomatic,

228
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,808
but we knew if they had
pathology in the brain

229
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,012
based on their
cerebrospinal fluid.

230
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,717
We were interested in abundance
and diversity of gut microbes.

231
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,853
So, if you think about
a healthy ecosystem,

232
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,522
there's lots
of different kinds of plants,

233
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,224
compared to,
like, a monoculture.

234
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,893
So, we wanted to see how
many different things there are

235
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,162
and then also
how much of different kinds

236
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,831
of microbes were present.

237
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,868
When we looked at people with
Alzheimer's disease dementia,

238
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,604
they had reduced diversity.

239
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,842
So, not as many different kinds
of microbes in the gut.

240
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,877
Some of the microbes
were elevated,

241
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:21,415
but much more were reduced
in Alzheimer's disease dementia.

242
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,118
And we, after we published
these findings,

243
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,920
a number of other studies

244
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,223
actually confirmed
our original observations

245
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,425
of reduced diversity.

246
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,928
We also saw that the abundance
of certain bacteria

247
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:38,932
was associated with how
much brain pathology people had,

248
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,535
even among people
who were asymptomatic,

249
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,837
suggesting that there
could be an early relationship

250
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,574
between the gut and brain
in dementia.

251
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:52,546
So, how do we potentially
change the gut microbiome?

252
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,082
So, there's a number
of different factors

253
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,017
that shape
our gut microbiome.

254
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,754
Many of them shape our gut
early in life.

255
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,390
We're, as scientists,
interested

256
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,325
in potentially harnessing ways

257
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,328
to change the gut microbiome
to improve health.

258
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,130
And you're gonna hear
about some of those

259
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,099
from my colleague, Dr. Rey.

260
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:16,136
But, for example, diet has
a large impact on the gut.

261
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,273
We're also interested
potentially in probiotics.

262
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:24,077
We might even explore
microbial transplant to see

263
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,181
if that can have
a benefit for individuals,

264
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,285
for their healthy aging
and for their brain.

265
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,954
I did want to tell you
a little bit,

266
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,157
kind of to bring it back
to Dr. Metchnikoff.

267
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,926
There was a clinical trial

268
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,996
that looked recently
at supplementing diet

269
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,932
with fermented foods.

270
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,602
And so, in this clinical trial,
the participants

271
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,172
who had previously not been
eating a lot of fermented foods

272
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,974
started a diet
with fermented foods,

273
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,844
including yogurt, kombucha,

274
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,083
brined vegetables, and kimchi,
for example.

275
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,753
And what the investigators
found was that those individuals

276
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,556
who ate more fermented foods

277
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,693
actually had changes
in their gut microbiome.

278
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,128
So, they had
increased diversity,

279
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:21,301
and it appeared to positively
impact their immune function.

280
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,771
What was interesting was,
there wasn't just more diversity

281
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,975
because they were eating
microbial-rich foods,

282
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,310
but that eating
the microbial-rich foods

283
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:35,249
actually kind of made their
intestines more hospitable

284
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,418
to different kinds of microbes,
suggesting that this

285
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,789
could be potentially
beneficial for health.

286
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,591
So, the takeaways are

287
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,228
that gut microbiome
is important for health.

288
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,765
It's been implicated
in longevity, healthy aging.

289
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,901
We do believe
that it may play a role

290
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,870
in Alzheimer's disease dementia.

291
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,806
But the caveat is that
these are still early studies.

292
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,510
We need more mechanistic
studies, more clinical trials.

293
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,112
And you're gonna learn
a little bit more

294
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,847
from my colleague, Dr. Rey.

295
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,015
And I'll stop there.

296
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,616
Thank you.

297
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,919
[audience applauding]

298
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,758
And I'll welcome Dr. Rey
to the stage.

299
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,694
- Dr. Federico Rey:
Thank you, Barb.

300
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,396
Thanks for the invitation.

301
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,599
And so, yes,
I'm a microbiologist,

302
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,334
and I'm interested

303
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:31,972
in how the metabolism
of bacteria influence disease

304
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,308
and sort of what I'll
be telling you about, the work

305
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:39,179
that we're doing with regards
to Alzheimer's disease.

306
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,748
And so Barb did
a great introduction

307
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,383
to the gut microbiome.

308
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,052
And there are a couple
of aspects

309
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,322
that I would like
to sort of remind everybody.

310
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,392
And one of those is that the
genomes of the microbes

311
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,528
that colonize our gut

312
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,532
represent an enormous
genetic repository

313
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,267
that encode for functions

314
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,036
that we did not have to evolve
on our own

315
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,372
and endowed us
with capabilities,

316
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,107
metabolic capabilities,
for example,

317
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:11,078
to digest fruits and vegetables
and so on.

318
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,082
And that sort of
metabolic capability

319
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,051
has some features that
are conserved among all of us.

320
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,753
But there are also

321
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,223
sort of quite a bit
of variability among individuals

322
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,193
in those capabilities
in our microbiome.

323
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,929
So, we have a unique set
of microbes,

324
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,797
each of us, in our gut.

325
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,634
And the other sort of aspect
that I wanted to mention

326
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,606
is that sort of the idea of that
the microbiome is quite plastic,

327
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,443
so we can change, you know,

328
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,680
through diet or through some
other interventions,

329
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,416
we can sort of change the
composition

330
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,951
of the gut microbiome.

331
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,487
However, the up to date,
we can make broad changes,

332
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:56,890
but to make sort of precise
changes of specific taxa,

333
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,393
we're not there quite yet.

334
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,062
And so the other aspect that
I wanted to mention is that,

335
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,564
even though we can,

336
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,399
you know,
we have the idea of the notion

337
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,801
that we can change
the microbiome through diet,

338
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:10,137
most microbes that colonize us

339
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:13,173
stay with us
for very long periods of time.

340
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,375
You know, the studies
that are published today

341
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,245
that look at up
to eight years,

342
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,949
but about 60% of the microbes
that we detect today,

343
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,750
we're likely gonna see

344
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:28,155
in sort of colonizing you
eight years from now.

345
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,825
So, my lab is interested
in understanding sort of

346
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:35,028
the consequences of our
gut microbial differences.

347
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,430
So, you know, there are

348
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,499
about thousands of microbes
can colonize our gut.

349
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,201
And each of us sort of ends up

350
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,103
with a collection,
a unique collection

351
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,840
of 100 to 200 different species
of bacteria.

352
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,342
So, we're interested in

353
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:52,713
how these microbial differences
influence the metabolism

354
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,448
of the food that we consume

355
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,417
and how these in turn
impact our health.

356
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:01,121
So, the central hypothesis that
drives the research in my lab

357
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,925
is that the gut microbiome is
a key determinant

358
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:09,129
of how we respond to the diet
that we consume.

359
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,432
So, think about
your favorite meal.

360
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,968
This is my favorite meal,
and the point

361
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:19,106
that I wanna drive from this
slide is that everything

362
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,708
that we consume,
this is a microbe,

363
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,977
or there are many microbes
out there

364
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,346
that can process it
into something else.

365
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,548
And so they are gonna go

366
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,650
through the different components
of this meal.

367
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,187
You know, we have
a salad rich in fiber

368
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,790
and plant polysaccharides,
which are sort of great food

369
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,492
for our gut bacteria.

370
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,428
And they use it
as a substrate for growth.

371
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,297
And they generate energy.

372
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:47,901
And as a product of their
metabolism of this fiber,

373
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:49,736
they produce small molecules

374
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,605
called
short-chain fatty acids.

375
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,440
These short-chain fatty acids,
you know,

376
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:57,144
the predominant ones are
acetic acid, like vinegar,

377
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,079
propionate, and butyrate.

378
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:03,951
They have been linked
with many benefits on health.

379
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,987
A good red wine
is a rich source

380
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,389
of antioxidants,
and antioxidants,

381
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,692
there has been a lot
of studies on antioxidants

382
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,461
and the protective effects
on cardiovascular health.

383
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,630
What we're learning
is that some of us

384
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,365
harbor bacteria in our guts

385
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,068
that can turn those antioxidants
that are in wine

386
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,137
and other fruits into compounds

387
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:27,841
that are way more potent
than what is present

388
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,143
in the red wine or fruit.

389
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,247
And then we look at the steak.

390
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:37,618
It's a great source
of essential nutrients

391
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,353
or key nutrients for our health,

392
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,788
like choline and carnitine
and histidine.

393
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,491
But what we have learned
over the last few years

394
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,895
is that there are bacteria
in our guts

395
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,131
that like these substrates
as much as we do

396
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:54,635
and can turn it
into compounds or metabolites

397
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,537
that maybe are not as good
for us.

398
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,440
And I'm gonna tell
you a little bit about that.

399
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,209
So, this is sort of the pipeline

400
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:05,145
that we have,
our discovery pipeline

401
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:08,482
sort of from correlation
to causation

402
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,152
in trying to understand how
bacteria metabolism

403
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,755
influences AD progression.

404
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:19,493
So, through our collaborations
with ADRC and with Dr. Bendlin,

405
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,263
we start usually
with populations of humans,

406
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,165
large populations of humans

407
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,601
that are fairly
well-characterized

408
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:31,371
in terms of the
AD-related phenotypes.

409
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:35,776
We have data on cognition
for these individuals.

410
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:40,113
And we take their fecal samples,
we measure their,

411
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,882
we look at their bacteria.

412
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:46,053
We look at the metabolites
that are in their blood

413
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,454
and cerebrospinal fluid.

414
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,156
And then we sort of run
correlations

415
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,693
to identify metabolites
or bacteria

416
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,263
that track with disease.

417
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,733
And so that sort of leads us
to generate hypotheses

418
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,302
about the function
of these metabolites

419
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,972
or the relation of these
bacteria or these metabolites

420
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,209
with disease, which we then
go into animal models

421
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:13,447
or in vitro models to test
whether these metabolites

422
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:16,450
that track with disease track
because they influence disease

423
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,619
or track because
they are produced

424
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,853
as a consequence of disease.

425
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,923
So, we do these tests
of causality

426
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,259
and then try to understand
if they are causal,

427
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,828
if they have an effect
of disease, how,

428
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,830
and we try to understand
the mechanisms.

429
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:35,369
So, this is sort of the central
or conserved sort of studies

430
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,106
that we do for many,
for a lot of our work.

431
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,409
And so I'm gonna tell you
about one metabolite

432
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,811
or sort of gonna tell you
about two groups of metabolites.

433
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:47,614
But this one,
I'll tell you before,

434
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,450
is called
imidazole propionate.

435
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,885
I'll tell you more
about that metabolite.

436
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:55,522
But we see it is
a bacterial metabolite

437
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,393
that we see in the blood
of people

438
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,730
that is increased in individuals

439
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:07,467
that score lower
in the cognitive test.

440
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:11,405
What I'm showing you here
are three graphs

441
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,174
where we look at
different cognitive tests,

442
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:17,978
where we assess
executive function,

443
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,480
memory, vocabulary, and so on,

444
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:21,982
sort of different types
of tests,

445
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,586
and we correlate
the scores on those tests

446
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:29,223
with the abundance of this
metabolite ImP in their blood.

447
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,058
And what we see is
that individuals

448
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,595
that tend to score better
in this test

449
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,667
have lower levels of the
metabolite in their blood,

450
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,637
whereas individuals
that score worse,

451
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:47,374
they have higher levels
in their blood.

452
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,944
And we also see that the
abundance of bacteria

453
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:55,983
capable of making this bacterial
metabolite are associated,

454
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:00,187
are positively associated,
with markers of neuron damage.

455
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:05,259
So, more bacteria that makes
ImP, more neuron damage.

456
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:09,162
So, a little bit
about this metabolite ImP.

457
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,165
It's a metabolite that
bacteria make from histidine.

458
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,968
Histidine is
an essential amino acid

459
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:18,739
that is present
in the steak that I show you.

460
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,807
And humans or mammals

461
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:25,512
can metabolize histidine
to some extent.

462
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:29,249
But bacteria can metabolize
histidine

463
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,485
to imidazole propionate.

464
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:33,187
And only bacteria can do that.

465
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,855
So bacteria,

466
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:37,324
whereas humans can do some
conversions of histidine

467
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:39,193
and be able to utilize
histidine,

468
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,929
we get only imidazole propionate
from bacteria,

469
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:44,364
and there's only a small set
of bacteria

470
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,001
that can actually do
this conversion.

471
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,240
So, because of the correlation
that we observe

472
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:56,376
between imidazole propionate
and cognition,

473
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,778
we decided to test

474
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:03,550
whether imidazole propionate
exacerbates AD pathology

475
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:05,519
in a mouse model of AD

476
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:09,656
And so what I'm showing you here
are slides,

477
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,826
cerebral slides
of brains of mice,

478
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:17,097
that were either treated
with ImP, to your right,

479
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:20,067
or that have low levels of ImP.

480
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,370
So, you know,
the slide to the right are mice

481
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:26,373
that have very high levels
of ImP in their blood.

482
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,975
And what we see, and so,
you know,

483
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,044
and just to guide you here,
so we have the cortex

484
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:34,681
and the hippocampus there
of the mice.

485
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:39,152
And what we see is that mice
that have high levels of ImP

486
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:44,024
accumulate a lot of amyloid
plaques on their brains

487
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,427
compared to control animals.

488
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:50,998
Here's more histology.

489
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:54,168
So, looking at a different type
of cells here,

490
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:58,005
these are called astrocytes,
that they look like stars,

491
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:02,209
and these cells' response
to damage in the brain

492
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,444
or to the accumulation
of plaques.

493
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:07,881
And we see that in mice
that have high levels of ImP

494
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:13,820
sort of the abundance of these
starlike cells called astrocytes

495
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:16,089
is more abundant
compared to control.

496
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,991
And here's
some of the statistics.

497
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:22,696
We do this in multiple mice
to get statistical body.

498
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:28,035
Okay, so, I told you
about one metabolite

499
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:31,371
that is potentially
sort of not good for us

500
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,942
and may sort of exacerbate
progression of disease.

501
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,944
There are other
bacterial metabolites

502
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,514
that might be good for us,
and such is the case

503
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:43,951
of these compounds called
short-chain fatty acids.

504
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,285
And so, as I told you,

505
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:49,723
these are mainly produced
by bacteria from dietary fiber.

506
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,360
And there are a number
of studies where

507
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,996
sort of scientists dose mice

508
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,232
with these
short-chain fatty acids,

509
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,334
specifically butyrate,

510
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,604
and they were able
to, sort of the similar study

511
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,939
I mentioned earlier
with imidazole propionate.

512
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,408
In this case, they increased
the levels of butyrate.

513
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:11,678
And what they see is that
increasing levels of butyrate

514
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,814
reduces disease progression.

515
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:17,851
And so some of the mechanisms
by which this might be happening

516
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:21,355
is sort of butyrate might have
anti-inflammatory effects

517
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:24,324
and be protective in the brain.

518
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,594
So, what we are doing,

519
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,898
so, all of this
was done in animals.

520
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,534
And so we were on mice.

521
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,868
So, we are testing this

522
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:37,738
whether this is true
also for humans.

523
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,940
So, in the human cohorts

524
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:43,443
that Barb mentioned,
we collected fecal samples

525
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,414
and we are measuring
short-chain fatty acids

526
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:52,219
in feces of individuals
that are either negative

527
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:54,121
or positive for amyloids.

528
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:57,524
So, individuals that have
AD pathology in their brain

529
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,660
and, you know,
the findings that we're getting

530
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,063
is that individuals
that are positive

531
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,300
for amyloid tend
to have lower levels

532
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:08,368
of short-chain fatty acids,

533
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,604
consistent
with what we're seeing in mice,

534
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:14,942
and maybe suggesting that these
metabolites might be protected

535
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:18,212
or might slow down
the accumulation of amyloid

536
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,849
in the brain,
but more study is needed.

537
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,255
Okay, so, the take-home messages
from what I was telling you,

538
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,457
we see these associations

539
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:33,694
between the abundance
of gut bacteria

540
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,464
and their metabolites
with AD pathology in humans.

541
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,466
And for some of these
metabolites,

542
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:43,570
we see a causal role of these
sort of bacteria

543
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:45,372
and metabolites in mice.

544
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,508
And what I'm sort of trying
to say here

545
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,810
is that these metabolites
may potentially

546
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,345
change the trajectory,

547
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:54,481
may not be the cause
or the cure to the disease,

548
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:59,253
but just sort of change how fast
or slow the disease develops.

549
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,421
And, you know,
these are just two examples.

550
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,323
There are other examples
in the literature,

551
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,526
but I think this is
just the tip of the iceberg.

552
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:09,863
There's a lot more metabolites
to explore and discover.

553
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,332
And with that,
I'll thank you for your time

554
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,603
and thank the lab
and the funding sources.

555
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,906
[audience applauding]

556
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:31,552
- Barbara: So, now we're going
to have our fireside chat.

557
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:35,622
- Federico: Okay,
so I will probably start.

558
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:40,127
So, I mentioned
sort of the probiotics.

559
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:43,096
And I'm sure there's
a lot of people

560
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,333
interested in learning
whether we're finding out

561
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,069
what's the evidence
of probiotics and AD,

562
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,237
what has been done.

563
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:52,539
Are there strains that are good?

564
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:53,707
What do we know?

565
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,243
- Yeah,
so, there have been

566
00:27:57,144 --> 00:28:01,148
some small number
of studies with small numbers

567
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:04,017
of participants,
mostly looking at people

568
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:07,554
who already have
some memory impairment.

569
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:12,192
And the studies have shown
some positive effects

570
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,862
on cognitive function.

571
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:18,732
And most of those studies
use probiotics

572
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,937
like <i>Lactobacillus,</i>
<i>Bifidobacteria.</i>

573
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,541
But we're lacking
kind of large,

574
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:29,543
gold-standard clinical trials,

575
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,079
and there haven't been
any studies

576
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,680
that have looked at impacts

577
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:36,617
on those neuropathological
features that I showed.

578
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:37,951
So, looking at, say,

579
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:41,455
at amyloid plaques
or neurofibrillary tangles,

580
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:43,223
and you and I
have talked about this.

581
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,958
I don't think necessarily

582
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:48,896
that probiotics would stop
the spread of those pathologies

583
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:50,998
once they get going.

584
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,299
But potentially,

585
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:55,035
they could still have
beneficial impacts on the brain.

586
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:56,203
But we don't know.

587
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,404
We have to do those studies.

588
00:28:57,471 --> 00:29:00,007
- Yeah, probably
to look at change of sort of,

589
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,276
you know, changes in amyloid
or tau, sort of,

590
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:06,280
maybe the length of those
studies need to be, I mean,

591
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,482
I don't know how long were
these studies that you describe.

592
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,684
- Yeah, so, I mean,
the studies that have been done

593
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,453
mostly looked at memory,
and those were over,

594
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,489
kind of short periods of time.

595
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:19,493
But using the biomarkers,
like the brain imaging

596
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,229
or even maybe
the blood biomarkers,

597
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:25,032
we could see
if probiotics have an impact

598
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,368
on the actual biology
of the disease.

599
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,703
Yeah.

600
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,340
So, I think one question
I have for you,

601
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,275
and we were talking about it

602
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:39,179
before we started the session,
has to do with diet.

603
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,215
And I personally don't think

604
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,517
that there's, like, one diet
for everyone.

605
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:46,019
And we know, for example,
even, you know,

606
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:48,789
ketogenic diet
can have beneficial impacts

607
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:53,694
for some people, for example,
reversing insulin resistance.

608
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,364
But you showed a lot of
evidence for fiber-rich diets.

609
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,699
So, I'm curious.

610
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:01,235
A, is there a good diet
for everyone?

611
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:05,239
And B, can you speak to fiber
specifically?

612
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,408
- Yeah, so I mean, the answers
are, well, they also,

613
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:11,578
what the literature says
with regards to diet is,

614
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,280
and there's quite a bit
of variation

615
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:16,350
in responses to specific diets.

616
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:20,521
Some people respond great
to Mediterranean diets,

617
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:22,723
and people respond great
to ketogenic diets.

618
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:28,662
So, there's no universal diet
that is beneficial for health,

619
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:31,064
as most studies suggest.

620
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,002
However, I would say that fiber,

621
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:40,707
the sort of evidence
for fiber being beneficial,

622
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:44,478
I think is really strong
and for multiple diseases.

623
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:49,049
I'm not speaking about AD
specifically, but, you know,

624
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:53,320
sort of
particularly metabolic diseases.

625
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:56,490
So what, sort of the tweak there

626
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,092
is that
there are specific fibers.

627
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,929
There are people that respond
better to specific fibers,

628
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:04,798
where other people respond
better to other fibers.

629
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,401
And there's quite a bit
of variability when you look at,

630
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,436
you know, start sort of
looking at specific fibers.

631
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,938
There's quite a bit
of variability.

632
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:16,276
But if you consume a large sort
of good proportions of fiber

633
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:19,680
and, you know, the recommended
numbers are quite high

634
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:21,648
and hard to achieve,

635
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,019
of sort of a diverse source
of fibers,

636
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,388
I think sort of, that would be
my recommendation

637
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:31,291
so as to sort of what diet
would be good.

638
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:33,227
And this is something
that over the years,

639
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,562
I have become obsessed
with sort of my diet

640
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,664
and tweaking the amount
of fiber.

641
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:41,268
And so, what I say is
the recommendation of fiber

642
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:46,006
is about 30 to 35 grams of fiber
a day for an adult man

643
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:50,077
and about 30 for women.

644
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:52,246
And it's really hard.

645
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,682
You have to eat,
like, 20 oranges to get the...

646
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:58,585
[Barbara laughing]
So, getting the values of fiber

647
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:01,788
that are recommended
is not easy.

648
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,660
And so you have to be
very conscious about,

649
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,763
you know, incorporating fiber
in every meal

650
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,933
and every snack to reach those
levels that are recommended,

651
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,203
you know, sort of
for beneficial effects.

652
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,007
- Barbara: What's the best
fiber-rich snack?

653
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,175
- Federico: Orange.

654
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,910
[both laughing]

655
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,413
There are
some good cereals out there

656
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,716
that have astronomical amounts
of fiber

657
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,118
and that sort of have, you know,

658
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,787
very diverse sorts of fibers
that are good,

659
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:35,522
but in general, eating,

660
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:38,625
you know,
sort of grains and vegetables

661
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:42,563
and sort of can get
good fiber intake combined.

662
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,598
- Barbara: Yeah, okay.

663
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:51,004
- Federico: So, all this
evidence about our microbiomes

664
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,873
changing as we age.

665
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,911
And, you know, sort of talk
a little bit

666
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,647
about what's happening
with the microbiome and aging

667
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:03,050
and sort of what's
the literature on that

668
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:05,085
and what you think is
sort of happening there.

669
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,887
Why does it change?

670
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:08,055
- Yeah.

671
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:11,925
So, as we get older,
generally speaking,

672
00:33:12,693 --> 00:33:14,661
there does seem to be

673
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:17,698
reduced diversity
as we get older.

674
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:20,367
And then another thing
that we've found

675
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,970
in our studies
is as people get older,

676
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:27,040
there's also increased
intestinal inflammation.

677
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,809
We see that as well.

678
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:31,745
So, there could be lots
of different reasons

679
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:34,081
that other people have studied,
not necessarily us,

680
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:38,385
but the, you know,
Westernization of the diet

681
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:42,489
reduces diversity.

682
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:46,693
Taking antibiotics
over the life course

683
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,563
probably reduces diversity.

684
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:55,636
I think probably medications
are also playing a role.

685
00:33:55,702 --> 00:34:01,508
And we have seen some impacts
of proton pump inhibitors, even,

686
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:05,112
in increasing
intestinal inflammation.

687
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,248
So, those are
very useful medications.

688
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:09,583
I take one myself.

689
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,121
But sometimes, you see
that literature and wonder,

690
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:18,058
is there ways
that we could potentially

691
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,494
promote increased diversity
with aging?

692
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,663
What would be the ways
that we could do that

693
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,832
as opposed to just
losing microbes?

694
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,534
I don't know,
are there other things

695
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:29,136
that you think are having
a negative impact?

696
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,470
- Federico:
Changes in mastication.

697
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:31,872
Sort of probably, you know,

698
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:35,342
sort of change
the access to sort of some

699
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,711
of those substrates and, you
know, how they get metabolized.

700
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:40,113
- Barbara: The kinds of foods
we're eating as we get older.

701
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,715
- Federico:
The kind of food, yes.

702
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:43,116
- Barbara: Yeah.

703
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:44,585
- Federico:
That also has an impact.

704
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:49,156
- Barbara: I mean, oranges
we can masticate, though, so...

705
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:50,924
- Federico: Absolutely.

706
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:54,161
- Barbara: Yeah,
what do you think

707
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:57,831
are kind of the
big opportunities in terms

708
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:00,300
of better understanding
of the microbiome

709
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:04,071
and then in terms of our work
for healthy brain aging?

710
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:06,707
You know, what do you see
as things on the horizon?

711
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,343
- I do think sort of,
you know,

712
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,645
and sort of obviously
I have a biased answer on this

713
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:14,214
because of my interest
in bacterial metabolism,

714
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,049
but I feel like sort of

715
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:19,553
there's a lot of opportunity
to sort of,

716
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,957
as I was alluding to everything
that we eat gets processed

717
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:29,129
or metabolized by bacteria,
resulting in compounds

718
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:32,666
that enter in our circulation
and affect our biology.

719
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,002
And so identifying,
you know,

720
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:39,206
sort of cases like ImP
and other metabolites.

721
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,575
I think ImP
and short-chain fatty acids

722
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,076
are just the tip of the iceberg,

723
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:47,281
and there's a lot of opportunity
to find sort of metabolites

724
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:48,849
that impact disease.

725
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,851
And maybe they sort of,
I imagine

726
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:54,321
sort of a constellation
of metabolites impact disease

727
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,889
in different conditions

728
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:59,726
and maybe impacting disease
in opposite direction

729
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:02,663
and in unique ways
for each individual.

730
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:07,201
So, a role for personalized
nutrition in sort of

731
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:12,639
impacting the ability
of those metabolites.

732
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:19,813
And yeah, so I think sort of,
and then sort of the idea,

733
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,648
yeah, sort of the idea that,
you know,

734
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:24,318
maybe early interventions,
you know,

735
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:26,687
being mindful about what we eat

736
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,189
and sort of trying
to promote the production

737
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:33,060
of those beneficial metabolites
maybe might have a role

738
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:36,029
in sort of changing trajectory
of disease.

739
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,165
But there's more metabolites
to find.

740
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:39,466
And who knows?

741
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,002
Maybe there are some that are
more potent than others.

742
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,403
- Barbara: Can I ask you,
though,

743
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,172
so, do you think
that the best way

744
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,775
to change our microbiome
then will be through diet?

745
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:51,478
Or do you think there's
like a, people will do

746
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:55,415
some kind of probiotic cocktail
in the future?

747
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,650
- Federico: Yeah.

748
00:36:56,717 --> 00:37:00,954
So, I mean, I do think
that diet and sort of diet

749
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,525
using information of, you know,

750
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,361
of our gut microbiomes
to inform, you know,

751
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:10,230
to design our diets
with, you know,

752
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:15,235
with sort of microbiome-centered
sort of a strategy

753
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,204
to change our diets.

754
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,307
Sort of increasing
the production

755
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:23,143
of beneficial metabolites
is one way to go.

756
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,346
However, I would say
that in recent years,

757
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:30,450
the number of academic labs
and companies

758
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:31,952
that are studying,

759
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,654
sort of studying the idea of,
you know,

760
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,023
producing these cocktails
of bacteria,

761
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,225
these are defined sets
of bacteria

762
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,160
that have specific properties

763
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,930
and can be changed
with specific nutrients.

764
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:44,231
And, you know,

765
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:47,634
sort of, this would be
like a more advanced version of,

766
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:50,037
you know,
regular general probiotics

767
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,238
that you get in the store.

768
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,574
This would be prescribed

769
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,778
and that would target
specific conditions, you know,

770
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,014
to change the abundance
of specific metabolites

771
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,283
or to sort of talk
to the immune system

772
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,120
in a specific way
with specific bacteria.

773
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,123
I feel like that's sort of one
of the directions

774
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,825
that this field is going with,
you know,

775
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,961
moving from those
fecal transplants

776
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:16,964
that are very core
sort of changes in microbiome

777
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,802
to cocktails of bacteria
with specific functions.

778
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,204
- Barbara:
Do you take any probiotics?

779
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:28,742
- I drink kefir every day,
that has probiotics,

780
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,545
but I don't take pills
with probiotics.

781
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:33,180
And I should say
that probiotics,

782
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,816
I mean, they are very general.

783
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:39,987
And while
there's amazing data for some,

784
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:43,790
you know, in some cases
for some strains of probiotics,

785
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:46,226
there's quite a bit
of variation

786
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:49,129
on the responses,
depending on the strain.

787
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:52,299
And so, the data
out there is quite messy.

788
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:57,004
They are good sources to look
at specific strains of bacteria

789
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,740
and what clinical trials
have been done

790
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:04,811
sort of to try to match your
need with the right strain.

791
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:12,152
But I say that right now sort of
the field is quite, you know,

792
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:15,756
the data is quite messy
with very disparate effects.

793
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:18,091
However, I don't think
they are dangerous.

794
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:21,395
So, you know, if they work,
why not?

795
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:23,263
I would take them.

796
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,998
- Barbara: Yeah.

797
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,402
- Okay, so, over the years,

798
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:30,804
I have heard you
sort of talk about Alzheimer's

799
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:34,775
and sort of have learned
how complex this disease is

800
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:37,544
and sort of how challenging
it could be to find a cure.

801
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:41,481
So, can you sort of summarize
some of the...

802
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,716
I mean, is there hope,

803
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:47,287
and what are the recent
successes in this area?

804
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:48,455
- Barbara: Yeah.

805
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:51,325
So, I would say that,
you know,

806
00:39:51,825 --> 00:39:54,962
we've been studying Alzheimer's
for, you know,

807
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:58,098
over a hundred years
since it was identified.

808
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:00,434
But I would say
in recent years,

809
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,103
the last 5 to 10 years,
there's been some really,

810
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,706
truly major breakthroughs.

811
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,007
Some of them I mentioned,

812
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,276
which includes things
like being able to see

813
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:12,279
the disease developing
in the brain early, you know,

814
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:14,515
not waiting
until someone has passed away

815
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:18,719
to be able to see that, see
what is causing their dementia.

816
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:21,788
There have been
some promising breakthroughs

817
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,957
in terms of drugs
that have been developed.

818
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:28,495
So, there's new
monoclonal antibody therapies

819
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:32,032
that people can take
that you can now,

820
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,269
you know, actually get at
the hospital here in Madison.

821
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:37,638
You know, I have friends
who are clinicians

822
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:39,606
who are prescribing
these new medications

823
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:42,776
that remove amyloid
from the brain.

824
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,278
And then we also,

825
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,680
you know, we have
some great things going on.

826
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,149
I think even
in our research, as well.

827
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,286
And a lot of this
has been possible, you know,

828
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,954
through the funding
that we've gotten.

829
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,490
But then, also,
even more importantly,

830
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:59,159
our partnerships
with participants.

831
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:02,863
So, we're really fortunate
that we have so many people

832
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,033
who are engaged
in the topic of dementia

833
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,002
and have participated
in these studies

834
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:11,104
and have made
these discoveries possible.

835
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:14,808
So, I see that as very,
very hopeful.

836
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,611
- Federico: I agree.
- Barbara: Yeah.

837
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:20,814
We are open for questions
from the audience as well.

838
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:24,084
I believe there will be some
microphones.

839
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:29,489
So, just raise your hand, and
someone will bring you a mic.

840
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,165
- Attendee 1: So,
how far are we away

841
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:42,236
from having people donate
a sample of feces

842
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:46,373
and analyzing their microbiome?

843
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:50,344
And you say they react
different to fibers

844
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,446
based on what the microbiome is.

845
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:56,517
So, is that gonna be
in a clinical scenario?

846
00:41:57,985 --> 00:41:59,987
- I mean,
I don't know how long,

847
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:02,556
but I'll say, like,
that is the vision.

848
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,527
So, I know people and I think
there's private companies

849
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:08,195
that are pursuing this as well,

850
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:12,065
but that you would send
your stool sample

851
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,268
and then find out, you know,

852
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:17,804
what kinds of microbes
you have present,

853
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,641
maybe how those influence
your risk for disease,

854
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,676
maybe give you some suggestions

855
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:25,445
for different diets
or probiotics.

856
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:28,215
I think there's even, like,
ideas

857
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:31,418
for "smart" toilets
in the works.

858
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:34,888
But how far away are we
from that?

859
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,624
- Federico: I don't think so,
not very far.

860
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,960
Already, you know,
as Barb mentioned,

861
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:41,295
there are companies
working on this

862
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:44,164
and there are publications,
you know, sort of

863
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:48,702
where they use information
from the microbiome

864
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,471
and sort of some,

865
00:42:51,538 --> 00:42:54,975
you know, other metadata
to predict responses,

866
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:58,679
glucose responses to diet
with high accuracy.

867
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:01,882
And so, the microbiome
information sort of aids

868
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,852
into those predictions
to a great deal.

869
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,621
So, I think that we're not
that far

870
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,890
from that sort of becoming more,

871
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:12,960
the evidence still developing,
but sort of developments

872
00:43:13,026 --> 00:43:16,597
on AI and those type
of sort of approaches

873
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:20,300
is also accelerating
how we mine the microbiome data,

874
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,569
the very complex
microbiome data,

875
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:26,306
and apply it to these
type of questions.

876
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,282
- Attendee 2: Okay.

877
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:38,318
So, you were mentioning
about the various metabolites

878
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:42,956
that increase the incidence
of a-beta plaques.

879
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:46,693
Do you think that those
are directly interacting

880
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,598
with the monomeric amyloid beta
and influencing the aggregation,

881
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:54,801
or it's just
a downstream effect?

882
00:43:55,302 --> 00:44:00,040
- So, this is sort of,
specifically sort of for ImP.

883
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:02,609
So, this is sort of
work in progress.

884
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:06,446
So, the evidence that we have
suggests that maybe,

885
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:09,116
so ImP seems to be interacting

886
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:12,553
or disrupting
blood-brain barrier function

887
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:17,524
and maybe sort of impacting
the clearance of amyloid.

888
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:19,760
So, we don't have
sort of definitive data on that,

889
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,162
but it doesn't seem,
we don't know

890
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:24,898
whether ImP sort of how,
you know, the exposure,

891
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:26,800
how much gets into the brain.

892
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:28,969
So, I would think
that the effects might be due

893
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:31,271
to the effects
on the vasculature.

894
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,574
And we have data
sort of suggesting

895
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,110
that it does impact
the vasculature.

896
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:42,216
Any other questions?

897
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:46,587
- Attendee 3: Hi, great talk.

898
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:51,859
I'm wondering how do you address
the interindividual variability

899
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:56,063
that you showed both
with the data and what we know

900
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:58,899
when you design a human study?

901
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,667
- Barbara: Mm.

902
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:03,403
That's tricky.
[laughing]

903
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,805
It's true, with the animal,

904
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,640
you know,
the animal studies are so easy

905
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,243
because all the animals
are kind of the same.

906
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:12,012
And with humans--
Go ahead.

907
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,847
- Federico: They're less similar
than we hope.

908
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,249
- Barbara: Okay, okay, yeah,
that's true.

909
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:18,418
You have a whole other
body of research on that.

910
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:19,753
That's true.

911
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,054
- Federico: But not like humans.

912
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,857
- Barbara: But I guess you might
have seen some of the,

913
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,560
some of the pictures
that Federico showed.

914
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:31,198
Even those relationships between
ImP and the cognitive function,

915
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,867
all those little dots
are everywhere, right?

916
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,236
And so there's a lot
of different things

917
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:38,839
that are impacting trajectories.

918
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:42,176
And, you know, maybe
we're going about it wrong.

919
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:46,146
I mean, ideally we would
find probiotics, for example,

920
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:51,151
that would reduce risk
for dementia across the board.

921
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:55,255
But maybe it's not going
to be as simple as that.

922
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:58,692
I mean, and just
to add one more complexity,

923
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:01,862
usually when people develop
dementia, there's a lot

924
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,731
of different pathologies that
are accumulating in the brain.

925
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,466
I talked about amyloid and tau,

926
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:08,135
but there might be
other things going on.

927
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:10,304
There might be
vascular dysfunction.

928
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:13,040
There might be other
abnormal proteins.

929
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:15,909
So, it does get really tricky.

930
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:18,412
All that said, we still try

931
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:22,950
to figure out what's
the effect of the probiotic

932
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:25,552
or the drug that we're testing.

933
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,187
And if we know
what the effect is,

934
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:29,556
what the effect size is,

935
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:32,559
then we can calculate,
for example,

936
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:36,330
how many people we need to have
in a study to see the effects,

937
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:38,866
but it's not simple,
yeah.

938
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:42,202
- Federico: Maybe what I can add
to that is sort of the idea

939
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,604
that we don't think,

940
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,339
at least from the perspective
of the microbiome,

941
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:47,908
there's not gonna be
one metabolite that,

942
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:51,745
you know, that is <i>the</i> metabolite
that we have to--

943
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,780
It's gonna be different
from different people.

944
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:57,384
So, the idea that
we have to think about,

945
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:59,520
instead of thinking about
individual metabolites,

946
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:02,189
we have to think about
constellations of metabolites

947
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:03,357
that are different.

948
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,259
You know, like
our microbiome is very different

949
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,661
among different people.

950
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,633
- Attendee 4: Hi,
thank you for the talk.

951
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:13,934
I have a personal question.

952
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:18,705
So, if I wanted to kind of do
an experiment on myself,

953
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:20,240
how can I, I guess,

954
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:23,110
compare diets to see
which one would work best for me

955
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:27,114
without being
a research participant?

956
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,382
- Barbara: Yeah, okay.

957
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:33,554
So, I'm not advising
that you experiment on yourself.

958
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,122
That's the first caveat.

959
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:38,759
But, you know, we have done
studies where, for example,

960
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:42,529
people wanted to know how they
responded to different foods,

961
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:48,101
just even this, like, idea
of monitoring your glucose.

962
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,770
You know,
you could get a glucose monitor,

963
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:52,339
and you could try
different diets and then see

964
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:54,208
how it affects
your glucose levels.

965
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:58,178
That would be
a very simple thing to do.

966
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,280
I think that some people maybe

967
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:02,316
who have access
to the technology

968
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:06,019
also collect stool samples and
monitor their stool to see how,

969
00:48:06,086 --> 00:48:10,324
for example, higher-fiber diets
might impact their composition.

970
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,959
But that could get expensive,
right?

971
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,293
- Federico:
It can get expensive.

972
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,831
And also, I think sort of,
we don't have at this point,

973
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:20,133
you know, we look at microbiome
composition of a person

974
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,237
and we cannot tell you,
"Oh, this is healthy."

975
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:27,474
You know, we can say how far you
are from healthy if you're not.

976
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:31,845
But it's hard to define healthy
or healthier, you know?

977
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,248
So it's just sort of
challenging to do

978
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,250
from the microbiome perspective.

979
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:37,451
But maybe like what you said,

980
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:40,621
tracking the phenotype
of interest.

981
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:42,656
I mean, I think of mice
most of the time.

982
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:45,058
So, I don't have a good
suggestion.

983
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:48,028
- Barbara: You could, you know,
maybe it wouldn't be unbiased,

984
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:51,365
but you could track how
you subjectively feel, you know?

985
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,100
Are you sleeping better?

986
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,435
Do you have more energy?

987
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:57,037
Those kinds of things, yeah?

988
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,639
- Attendee 4:
I have a follow-up question.

989
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:02,242
So, with glucose,
I can look at my HbA1c,

990
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,178
and I kind of know
how that's trending.

991
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:09,149
Is there a similar metric
or metrics for gut health?

992
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:13,820
- Barbara: Mm, again, I think
it would be, you know,

993
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:17,824
some of these things
that we collect in the lab.

994
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:21,328
But then, because it's
not, like, so easy to do,

995
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:25,265
for example, an analysis
of your stool sample.

996
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:29,203
There is a Bristol
stool scale you could see

997
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:32,539
just what
your stool looks like and see

998
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:36,009
how the effects of fiber
are impacting you.

999
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:39,479
See what happens
after you eat your 20 oranges.

1000
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,215
[both laughing]

1001
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,486
- Attendee 5: Hi, thank you,
great talk.

1002
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:47,921
I have a question.

1003
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,524
You guys talk a lot about how
diet influences your microbiome.

1004
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,093
I'm curious if you guys
have explored how stress

1005
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,164
or other lifestyle factors
change your microbiome

1006
00:49:57,231 --> 00:50:01,034
and to what extent
in comparison to diet?

1007
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,872
- Federico: I mean,
I have not explored that.

1008
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:07,741
We have not done
sort of in our studies.

1009
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:11,745
There are studies out there
suggesting that it does.

1010
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:13,680
We sort of have looked at.

1011
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:16,783
We did a collaboration
many years ago

1012
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:20,187
looking at social interactions
and, you know,

1013
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:22,055
ourselves and there are studies
suggesting

1014
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,958
that social interactions
sort of have a large impact

1015
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,793
on microbiome,

1016
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,230
and, including sharing
of taxa among people

1017
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:34,968
that have close interactions,
sort of like spouses

1018
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,938
and the sort of the quality
of the relationships,

1019
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:41,041
you know, correlated
with the number of taxa

1020
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:42,209
they correlated.

1021
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:44,378
So, there are many
sort of aspects

1022
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:46,313
of our life that, you know,

1023
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,816
including stress that sort of
impact the microbiome,

1024
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,552
absolutely.

1025
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,153
- Barbara: And I think

1026
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,089
if you are following
this series next month,

1027
00:50:56,156 --> 00:51:00,694
there will be a talk
on microbiome and mindfulness.

1028
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:04,131
So, we might learn more about
how reducing stress

1029
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:06,867
can potentially impact
the microbiome

1030
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:08,168
through mindfulness.

1031
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,770
I'll be looking forward
to that one.

1032
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:12,172
- Federico: Yeah, absolutely,
flip side.

1033
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,740
- Attendee 6: Hi.

1034
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:16,243
Thank you so much
for your talks.

1035
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:21,782
You said that there are some
companies trying to associate

1036
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:27,154
benefits of having
certain type of microbiota

1037
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:32,292
or the whole thing,
microbiome and some metabolites.

1038
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:35,729
And you said
that they're publishing this.

1039
00:51:35,796 --> 00:51:37,731
My concern or my question is,

1040
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:41,468
are they really assessing
food intake?

1041
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:45,472
- Federico: Well,
I cannot speak for every study,

1042
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:49,343
but most, you know,
microbiome studies,

1043
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:54,781
they do collect, or many,
or at least the intention is

1044
00:51:56,016 --> 00:51:59,019
to collect these sort of,
diet information is very useful

1045
00:51:59,086 --> 00:52:02,689
and informs greatly
changes in microbiome.

1046
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:04,491
I think many studies do,

1047
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:08,829
but I don't know
for the specific companies.

1048
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,598
But I do, I mean,
maybe I wanna add to that

1049
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:15,569
that I think sort of
the field is evolving.

1050
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:19,940
We don't have the answers
to everything.

1051
00:52:20,007 --> 00:52:22,009
And I'll be skeptic somewhat

1052
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:24,311
that today will make you
recommendations on

1053
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:27,748
how to change your microbiome
based on what you already have.

1054
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,950
I don't think the field
is there today.

1055
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:33,320
So, I'd be skeptic of a company
sort of making such suggestions.

1056
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:36,557
- Attendee 6: Yeah, me too,
thank you so much.

1057
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:37,758
- Attendee 7: I'm just curious.

1058
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:41,195
How long does it take
to change your microbiome

1059
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:46,266
if you were gonna change
your diet or take probiotics?

1060
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:48,969
- Federico:
Maybe I can take that.

1061
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:55,142
So, studies in mice show that
the changes happen overnight,

1062
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:56,743
really quick.

1063
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,378
You know, overnight,
you see changes.

1064
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:01,481
By week, two weeks, you see
very dramatic changes.

1065
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:05,552
In humans, the story is
a lot more complicated.

1066
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,254
you know, as it always is.

1067
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:11,792
And unless you do
very dramatic changes of diet,

1068
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,929
you know, let's say
you become vegetarian.

1069
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:20,000
You, like, you go
from carnivorous to vegetarian

1070
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:23,971
or become, or start doing
ketogenic diet.

1071
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:27,841
So, the changes are
very subtle in humans

1072
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:30,143
and take very long time.

1073
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:35,282
And what you typically see
is sort of changes

1074
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:37,084
of abundance of bacteria,

1075
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,454
but not so much disappearance
or, you know,

1076
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:44,992
new members coming in,
and that takes much longer.

1077
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,561
I don't have a sort of
time scale,

1078
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:49,963
so the changes, you know,

1079
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:54,368
I've seen studies where, you
know, someone takes antibiotics,

1080
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:57,204
for example, and there's a huge
depletion of the microbiome,

1081
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:01,074
and then they track
that person over months

1082
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:03,777
and, you know, and they put it
in different diets

1083
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:06,747
and the microbiome
doesn't change very much.

1084
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:10,384
So, it's very slow
to change in humans.

1085
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:19,059
- Attendee 8: Hi.

1086
00:54:19,126 --> 00:54:24,097
I'm wondering if that's the same
in the case of fecal transplant.

1087
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:29,102
- Federico: A fecal transplant
is, well, it all depends.

1088
00:54:29,169 --> 00:54:32,973
If there's
a previous antibiotic treatment,

1089
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,478
engraftment, it can be better,
but they are transient, too.

1090
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:41,415
So, usually sort of with,
you know, in cases,

1091
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,817
for example,
with C. difficile infection,

1092
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:46,987
which is when the fecal
transplant is prescribed,

1093
00:54:47,054 --> 00:54:49,590
usually you see
significant engraftment

1094
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:54,928
because that microbiome
is lacking a lot of bacteria.

1095
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:57,431
But if you do sort of
a fecal transplant

1096
00:54:57,497 --> 00:54:59,299
in a healthy individual,

1097
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:03,237
you're not gonna see
much engraftment of new taxa

1098
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:04,905
from the donor sample

1099
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,207
because there is a robust
community there

1100
00:55:07,274 --> 00:55:10,978
preventing the colonization
of what comes in.

1101
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:14,414
So, the fecal transplant
sort of,

1102
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,150
and we have sort of,
you know,

1103
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,754
we had intentions
of doing these studies,

1104
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:25,959
and we have this castle
of the fecal transplant trials,

1105
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:28,295
and there's a lot of poop

1106
00:55:28,362 --> 00:55:30,631
that has to be given
to the individual

1107
00:55:30,697 --> 00:55:32,833
to have sort of some level
of engraftment.

1108
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,968
But it's not great, though.

1109
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,637
You can change a few taxa,

1110
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:41,842
but you don't have a complete
reconfiguration of microbiome.

1111
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,243
- Barbara: We started

1112
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:48,916
a fecal microbiota transplant
study in Alzheimer's disease.

1113
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:52,352
We started it
before the pandemic,

1114
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:56,623
and then it stopped
when the pandemic started.

1115
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,824
But I will just say

1116
00:55:57,891 --> 00:56:02,229
that we had sourced the material
from a company

1117
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:08,735
that carefully screened
the stool for harmful microbes.

1118
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:13,941
And it's not a recommended
do-it-at-home type of activity

1119
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:17,978
like some people in the audience
might want to experiment with.

1120
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:22,049
But, yeah,
so, we did a few transplants.

1121
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:24,952
But I would say that again,
yeah, in healthy older adults,

1122
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:26,920
there's not that much known

1123
00:56:26,987 --> 00:56:29,056
about how quickly
that would happen

1124
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:31,758
and whether it would have
beneficial impacts

1125
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:33,427
or maybe even negative impacts.

1126
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:36,496
We don't know.
- Federico: We don't know.

1127
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:39,433
- Host: We have one final
question from online.

1128
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:43,136
Is there a standard blood test
for ImP

1129
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:48,442
that my rheumatologist,
neurologist, or PCP can order?

1130
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:50,644
- Federico: No.

1131
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,914
No, I want to sort of
answer that.

1132
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:56,383
I would say the data is
very preliminary,

1133
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,986
and we don't know
the side effect

1134
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:00,320
that might have in humans.

1135
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:02,823
But there's absolutely,
these are metabolites

1136
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,560
that we measure in academic
or commercial labs,

1137
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:09,329
but they are not in the clinic
yet.

1138
00:57:09,396 --> 00:57:10,664
- Host: Thank you.

1139
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:11,899
- Samantha: All right.

1140
00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:13,500
Thank you, everybody,
for joining us here tonight

1141
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,669
and for those of you online,
and just a reminder.

1142
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,137
Thank you for the plug before.

1143
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,741
Our next Crossroads of Ideas
will be on March 4,

1144
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:22,643
featuring mindfulness
and the microbiome.

1145
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:25,312
So, that will conclude
our three-part miniseries.

1146
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:26,713
So, be sure to check that out

1147
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,182
on our Crossroads of Ideas
webpage.

1148
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:30,751
There's also recordings of our
previous Crossroads as well,

1149
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,152
if you want to check those out.

1150
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:34,521
So, one more final round
of applause for our presenters.

1151
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:36,390
Thank you guys for being here.

1152
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:37,758
[audience applauding]

1153
00:57:37,824 --> 00:57:39,226
Excellent, all right,
have a good night.

1154
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,961
Thank you.
