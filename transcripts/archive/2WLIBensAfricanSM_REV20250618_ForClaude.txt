1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,070
[bright accordion music]

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,305
- Angela Fitzgerald: Along
Main Street in Stoughton,

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:10,244
the town's Norwegian heritage
is on proud display.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,181
But off Main, Ben's African
Mediterranean Cuisine

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:19,152
shows that Stoughton's global
connections go even broader.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,322
- Ben Pallangyo: Well, I grew up
in Tanzania, East Africa.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,790
Born and raised.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,393
- Angela: Ben Pallangyo's
East African background

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,696
is seen in the decor
and on the menu.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,400
- Then you go to main course,
then you go to dessert.

11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,601
This is so fresh.

12
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,070
You can do this with any meal.

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,306
- Angela: Keeping it fresh
for Ben

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,676
means an always-evolving menu.

15
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,412
- Our menu changes every hour.

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,847
- Angela: And hours
could be spent

17
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:51,785
looking at the trophies
of Ben's travels across Africa.

18
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,187
There, he leads safaris

19
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,122
featuring encounters
with animals

20
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,691
unlike any from Wisconsin.

21
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:01,929
[lions roaring]
- Ben: The pride of lions.

22
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,897
The hippo up closer.

23
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,000
Up-close encounter
with the elephants.

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,938
If you go on safari,
you come back different person.

25
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,105
- Angela: The word "safari"

26
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,374
simply means "journey"
in Swahili,

27
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,311
one of Ben's native languages.

28
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:22,249
His journey brought him along an
unlikely path to Stoughton.

29
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,253
Ben met a Wisconsin woman
while working as a restaurateur

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,789
and tour leader in Africa.

31
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,659
- My now ex-wife,
but great friend,

32
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,897
good relationship still because
we have a family together.

33
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,565
- Angela: Ben still remembers
the shock

34
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,869
of arriving
during Wisconsin's winter.

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,137
- Ben: It was bloody hell cold.

36
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,007
I feel like I'm at 19,340 feet,

37
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,644
which is the height
of Mount Kilimanjaro.

38
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,847
- Angela: But Ben quickly found
Wisconsin's warmth.

39
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,249
- My first impression was

40
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,284
Wisconsin people
are wonderful people.

41
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,785
Make no mistake.

42
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,621
- Angela: And Ben found
other signs

43
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,923
he'd come to the right place.

44
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,427
- When I come to Stoughton, I
found this flag from Tanzania.

45
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,431
- Angela: It was at the Lutheran
church he'd just joined.

46
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,268
- Ben: They support a mission
in Tanzania,

47
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,104
and I have a family member
who works there.

48
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,508
I immediately felt that
it was no coincidence.

49
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,045
You cannot ignore a sign,
a good sign.

50
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:29,550
There is a good sign sometimes
lands upon you.

51
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,586
- Angela: But not all signs
have been inviting.

52
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,289
Ben's own restaurant sign
was vandalized

53
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,724
a few months after he opened.

54
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,726
And that wasn't all.

55
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,563
- I just woke up,
I went to parking lot,

56
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,898
get into my car,
and I found out,

57
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:49,169
[glass shattering]
the window, it's broken.

58
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,839
I'm not concerned about the
small intimidation

59
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,874
of breaking my window.

60
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:58,612
You can break the window,
but you cannot break Ben.

61
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,585
Ben is an unbreakable animal
from Serengeti.

62
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,488
- Angela: And the community
rallied its support.

63
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,324
- Ben: People were very upset.

64
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,426
The community was upset.

65
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,829
So many people came here
to support me.

66
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,265
I've never seen this love
before.

67
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,535
Now there is something personal
to me about Wisconsin.

68
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,637
- Angela: Wisconsin will always
be a part

69
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,473
of Ben's safari through life.

70
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,676
- Wisconsin has given me
a family.

71
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,547
My son Remi, my daughter Chloe,

72
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:37,851
they're both Wisconsin kids,
raised here,

73
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,254
and they are incredible.

74
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,223
Wisconsin has given me life.

75
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,958
