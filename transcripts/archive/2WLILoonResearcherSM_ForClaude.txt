- Walter Piper: Good eye.

- Angela Fitzgerald: The most
important research

4
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,559
on Wisconsin's iconic loons

5
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:28,729
happens in the middle
of the night.

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:32,032
- Walter: Just another
routine night on the lake.

7
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,367
- Angela: From early on,

8
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:38,305
biologist Walter Piper has had
a fascination with loons.

9
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:43,177
- Healthy-looking chick.
[loon chick screeching]

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,646
There he is, real fuzzy.

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,183
Hasn't gotten adult feathers
in yet.

12
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,055
I've always been enchanted
by loons.

13
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,858
[loon calling]
As a child,

14
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,259
I heard loons out on the lake,

15
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,629
and they were beautiful
to listen to.

- Angela: For more
than 30 years,

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,002
Walter has been watching loons

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,406
during his annual pilgrimage
to northern Wisconsin.

20
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,807
- Walter: I really love
the solitude

21
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,376
of being out on a lake
in a canoe,

22
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,414
watching loons, being
sort of at one with them,

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,683
watching them
raise their families.

24

[loon calling]

25
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,753
- Angela: Walter is
a loon behavior

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,389
and reproduction specialist.

27
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,226
His observations are providing
new insights.

28
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,894
- When you see loons preening,

29
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,896
after they've done all that
combing of the feathers,

30
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,432
they'll get up and
straighten out their wings

31
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,168
by doing a wing flap.
[wings flapping]

32
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,171
- Angela: However, the calls
that echo across the lakes

33
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:48,308
in the Northwoods are still
very much a mystery.

34
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,043
[loon calling]

35
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,417
- Walter: We've only begun
to scratch the surface

36
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,621
about what they're communicating
with their calls.

37
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,656
- Angela: Those familiar
summer sounds

38
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,725
might also fade away.

39
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,727
- There are projections that
loons will disappear

40
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,730
from Wisconsin in the next
several decades.

41
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,200
- Angela: Imagine the
eerie silence on northern lakes

42
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,935
without loons.

43
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,142
- Walter: I'm very, very anxious
about this reproductive decline

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,877
that we've seen.

45
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,513
Reproductive success
is way down.

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,814
- Angela: This wasn't the case

47
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,786
when Walter first started his
loon research in 1993.

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,855
- Walter: Back in the
roaring '90s,

49
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,491
half the pairs
would have two chicks.

50
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,826
Now it's about three to one,

51
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,564
one-chick broods
to two-chick broods.

52
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,099
- Angela: That phenomenon
is putting more stress

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,035
on Walter's research,

54
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,737
making his work
even more crucial.

55
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,940
- Walter: We're going to three
lakes in the Rhinelander area:

56
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,143
Flannery, Washburn,
and Manson.

57
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,246
[loon calling]
Not too far away.

58
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,114
That's promising.

[owl hooting]

60
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,355
If we're trying to catch chicks,

61
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,325
I'll make a hoot call,
which is what the adults do.

62
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,926
It's like the deer
in the headlights.

63
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,928
If they hesitate
and stay on the surface

64
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,665
and they're not sure,
then we grab them.

65
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,603
[Walter whistling]

66
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,642
Now slow.
[whistling]

67
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,212
[splashing]

68
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,082
- Angela: The team will take
the loons to shore

69
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,217
to quickly conduct
their research

70
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,120
before releasing them back
into the wild.

71
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,755
- Walter: We weigh both adults
and chicks

72
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,056
when we capture them.

73
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,025
That's an important
measurement that we make.

74
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,727
And what we've noticed is that

75
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,096
chick mass has declined
substantially.

76
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,430
- Angela: Walter has a theory

77
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:54,168
on why chick mass continues
to decline.

78
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,937
- Walter: Loons
are visual predators.

79
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,339
Loons have to be able to see
their food to catch it

80
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,741
and to feed it to their chicks.

81
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,744
So, water clarity suddenly
came onto our radar.

82
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,113
And every time the satellite
passes overhead,

83
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,550
we can see, how clear
is the water in this lake?

84
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,919
Water clarity
in northern Wisconsin

85
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,720
had declined on average,

86
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,923
and this meant that
the overall decline

87
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,227
had an enormous impact on loons,
we realized.

88
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:26,099
- Angela: Another threat:
an explosion of black flies.

89
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,368
- Walter: That's related
to rainfall,

90
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,905
almost certainly related
to climate change.

91
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,041
We've had some almost complete
wipe-out years,

92
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,979
where all May nests that
loons attempt are wiped out.

93
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,081
Loons are just overwhelmed
by black flies.

94
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,519
There are thousands around them,
and they abandon the nest.

95
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,287
- Angela: The emerging danger
to loons

96
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,490
is playing out
in Walter's research.

97
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,595
- This year, it's about
105 pairs that we follow,

98
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,864
most of whom we've marked
in previous years.

99
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,132
Some of them, we marked
back in the '90s.

100
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,870
Okay, so this bird is green
over copper cream.

101
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,371
- Angela: Walter is
very familiar

102
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:08,442
with the loons here
on Manson Lake in Oneida County.

103
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,044
- Walter: The male is
an 11-year-old male.

104
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,247
The female is from Vilas County.

105
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,882
These are both adults
banded as juveniles,

106
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,383
so they're especially
valuable to us

107
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,951
'cause we know their age
exactly.

108
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,653
We also know their
natal origins,

109
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,990
so we can learn a lot about
their behavior and ecology

110
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,392
throughout their lives.

111
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,732
- Angela: On this night,
Walter captures their chick

112
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,035
and brings it to shore
for banding.

113
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,840
Despite the trends,

114
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:43,443
this baby loon
is defying the odds.

115
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,611
- Walter: Got it?

116
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,213
- Allie: Oh, that is
a big chick.

117
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,414
- Walter: A big old chick.

118
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,449
I know, a little nipper too.

119
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,251
She's our biggest one by far
this year.

120
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,588
- Angela: The chick weighs in
at more than 10 pounds.

121
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,624
- It's almost certainly a male,
to be that large this young.

122
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,526
It's about something
like eight weeks old.

123
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,261
It's just huge.

124
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,501
Okay, that's good.

125
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,469
Pretty, pretty big.

126
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:15,375
Okay, back in the box he goes,
before he nips me to death.

127
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,080
So, a very successful night.

128
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:24,551
All right, get them back
to where they belong.

129
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,886
We breathe sigh of relief

130
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,955
when we catch a big,
healthy chick like this

131
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,757
because it means that it's been
well fed.

132
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,126
That says good things
about Manson Lake.

133
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:38,332
It made us feel good to see such
a big, strapping male chick.

134
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,268
- Angela: It's hard not to see
the heartfelt connection

135
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:45,472
Walter has with these loons.
[loon calling]

136
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,842
- I love loons,
I love being outdoors.

137
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,546
I don't want to let loons
slip away in northern Wisconsin,

138
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,515
or at least I wanna do
everything I can

139
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,884
to try to keep them here because
they're beautiful animals

140
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,620
and they've given me so much.
