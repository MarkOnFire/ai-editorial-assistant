00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,444
- Norman Gilliland: Welcome
to <i>University Place Presents.</i>

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,179
I'm Norman Gilliland.

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:16,550
"I'm having my usual
pre-season panic attack.

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:20,821
"I'm feeling unprepared
both in scores and in sleep.

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:25,792
But then, I suppose this is
the normal annual condition."

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,296
So said Leonard Bernstein
about the difficulties

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,733
of being a conductor
at the beginning of a season.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,801
So many things to think about

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,471
and so many things
to worry about.

11
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,873
When a performance goes well,

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,076
it's easy for the audience
to assume that it's all

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,244
flowing naturally,

14
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,180
and yet, there is a lot
of preparation

15
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,716
and yes, a lot of anxiety
behind preparing a concert,

16
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,385
let alone a concert series.

17
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,721
And who could tell us more
about that than my guest?

18
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,090
Welcome to
<i>University Place Presents,</i>

19
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,894
longtime conductor of the
Madison Symphony, John DeMain.

20
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,763
- Hi, Norman, great to be here.

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,831
- Last time we talked,

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,634
we talked about your
long musical history

23
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,736
and even from early childhood,

24
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,239
and then your
early conducting experiences

25
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:17,311
and how naturally that seemed
to be for you, the thing to do,

26
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,813
despite some of the challenges,
of course,

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,949
that would apply
to any conductor.

28
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:28,155
But when you make the transition
from Texas, Houston, to Madison,

29
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,962
what kind of complications
arose in your career

30
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,764
which was already
well established at that point?

31
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,901
- Well, I was on the verge
in Houston

32
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:44,905
of trying to expand
my career more internationally.

33
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,641
And, some of that, actually,

34
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:52,546
I was planning to conduct some
<i>Toscas</i> in Bonn,

35
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,749
and the entendent
of that particular theater

36
00:01:55,816 --> 00:02:00,821
was actually arrested
for overspending the stipend,

37
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,791
you know,
that the government gives.

38
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,261
And so my performances
were canceled

39
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,029
and that never happened.

40
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,598
But I had been at Houston
for 18 years,

41
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,467
and I thought, you know,

42
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,204
"I don't want to just be
in one place my entire life."

43
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,408
So, and I had started
actually in symphonic,

44
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,510
doing a lot of symphonic.

45
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,879
Well, the St. Paul Chamber
Orchestra was, you know,

46
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,115
it was a symphonic path,
and before that,

47
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,516
the Norwalk Symphony.

48
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:34,655
And so I had this, and I
suddenly changed, you know,

49
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:39,092
direction with the offer to go
to Houston Grand Opera,

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,594
the Texas Opera Theater.

51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,765
So, and I found that the more
I had a reputation,

52
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,267
and I had a lot of success
with the world premieres

53
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,002
and <i>Porgy and Bess</i>
and all of that,

54
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,772
the more I was being tapped
as an opera conductor,

55
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,242
and the harder it was to get
anybody to take me seriously

56
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,977
as a symphony conductor.

57
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,080
I did have a shot
at the Omaha Symphony,

58
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:04,918
and the search committee told me
that I would have won that,

59
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,620
that position.

60
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,656
But the outgoing president
of the board jumped the search

61
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,925
before it was finished
and panicked

62
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,328
and hired somebody else.

63
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,365
And that was upsetting
to the orchestra and me.

64
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:22,236
But anyway,
they have a wonderful result

65
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:26,840
as of all those years and
my time in Omaha and Houston.

66
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:30,711
So, but I was beginning
to get really frustrated

67
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,146
because Mahler didn't write
any operas,

68
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,482
and they did Bruckner.

69
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,451
So I mean,
there's just so many composers

70
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,553
that, you know,
you want to get your hands on,

71
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,488
and it was impossible to.

72
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,790
And so I thought,
you know, I can do this.

73
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,926
I really want to have
a symphony orchestra.

74
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,261
How can I do it?

75
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,064
And I thought, well,
at 45 years of age,

76
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,401
you know, or 47,
I think at the time I came here,

77
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,004
you know, I was not gonna get
the New York Philharmonic.

78
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,338
Let's be honest,

79
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,942
because I didn't have any
track record leading up to that

80
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,144
symphonically in a major way.

81
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,647
And it's interesting because
I think if you're 19 years old

82
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,982
and you do your,
you know, you suddenly jump in

83
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,617
and you do a Brahms symphony,
everybody goes,

84
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,885
"Oh, wow, wow, wow."

85
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,220
But if you're 47 years old

86
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,621
and you're suddenly doing
your Brahms symphony

87
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,623
for the first time,
they go, "Who are you kidding?"

88
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,559
You know, 'cause those guys
have been playing that

89
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,627
for all those years,
you know, over and over,

90
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,030
almost every other season,
they're playing the same pieces.

91
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,364
They want somebody to come in

92
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,967
who really has been around
the block with these pieces

93
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,369
and has fresh ideas or whatever,
you know.

94
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,772
So that reality was
very clear to me.

95
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,909
So I wanted to go somewhere
where it was professional,

96
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,578
where I could make a difference.

97
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,313
Hopefully I could make
a difference.

98
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,981
And so that, I was, I mean,

99
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,784
I would, I didn't want to be in
front of an amateur orchestra.

100
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,853
That would have been
too much of a change

101
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,288
from what I was doing
in my opera world,

102
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,324
'cause I had
the Houston Symphony in the pit.

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,860
I had, you know, Seattle
Symphony when I was in Seattle.

104
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,862
I had, you know,
great orchestras

105
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,697
to work with all the time.

106
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:01,001
So, but it was interesting
when I applied to come here

107
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,337
because the search
was being handled

108
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,172
by Madison Area
Technical College,

109
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,907
'cause at that time,

110
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,176
the symphony and the technical
college had a relationship

111
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,545
'cause Roland Johnson,
my predecessor,

112
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,080
taught there, you know,

113
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,815
and was very close friends
with the president,

114
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,017
I'm told, of the college.

115
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,954
And it was kind of disconcerting
because I would,

116
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,155
I had a question, you know,

117
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,058
and I would call
to ask about something about,

118
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,128
you know, the guest conducting
and the whole thing.

119
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,997
And these students would
answer the phone,

120
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,900
and they had not a clue
as to who a conductor was

121
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,101
or what he was, you know.

122
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,537
And I thought,
"What am I getting myself into?"

123
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:41,575
And, but what I did was
I came up to see <i>Shining Brow.</i>

124
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:45,512
You know, Roland wanted
to have a world premiere

125
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,748
under his belt
before he retired,

126
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,217
and everybody found
the right thing.

127
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,718
Frank Lloyd Wright,

128
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,556
the story that happened to him
out at Taliesin in Spring Green.

129
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,591
And I came up to see it,

130
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,461
and I was very impressed
with the level of production.

131
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,230
Of course, Stephen Wadsworth
had directed it,

132
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,265
and he's a very fine director.

133
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,402
And I guess Madison Opera
spent a little bit of money

134
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,904
on that production
because it really looked good,

135
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,840
and the orchestra played well.

136
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,141
I remember at the time

137
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,109
I thought the winds and brass
were terrific,

138
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,345
and I thought
the strings were dicey,

139
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,415
and, but I thought
I could make a difference

140
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,150
by the way I would rehearse,

141
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,153
'cause I've had
that situation before.

142
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,122
And, you know, let's see
where this goes.

143
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,557
So they gave--
So it's interesting.

144
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,292
They gave me the,

145
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,462
the first guest of the three
guests that they brought in,

146
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,930
I was the first one.

147
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,966
And on my program was
the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony.

148
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,134
And of course,
this season we've had

149
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,004
Michael Stern conducting
the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony.

150
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,841
So that was,
and then there were in January

151
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,377
when they sat down to meet,

152
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,013
they remembered me 'cause,
you know, I thought,

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,314
"Are they gonna remember me?"

154
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,650
'Cause the last person
is the freshest in your mind.

155
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,519
But they did,
and they offered me the job.

156
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,689
So, when you say the
challenges, well, first of all,

157
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,124
what I did when I came here

158
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,993
is I sat down
with the search committee

159
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,296
in which there were some players
on the search committee,

160
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,031
and I said to them,

161
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:15,936
"What would you like
the next music director to do?"

162
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,204
'Cause I thought, you know,

163
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,541
why not find out what they want,
what they hope for.

164
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,543
And they did not want me
to come in there

165
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,278
and fire everybody
and throw everybody out.

166
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:28,215
They said, "Just make us play
better," is what they told me.

167
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,150
- That's nicely humble.

168
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,785
- Yeah, nicely humble.

169
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,221
And so I thought, "Okay,
that gives me, you know,

170
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,889
some framework
to come in,"

171
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,393
because you're walking into an
orchestra that you don't know.

172
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,762
In fact,
it's only in recent years

173
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,497
that I discovered the history

174
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,966
of how this became a
professional orchestra

175
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,467
'cause they, you know,

176
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,836
we're about to celebrate
our centennial.

177
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,772
When this orchestra started out,
it was not paid.

178
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,440
It was a community orchestra.

179
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,944
And Roland was the one
who converted to being paid.

180
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,414
And I didn't realize
that the principal players

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,582
that played in the orchestra

182
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,251
when I got there
never took an audition.

183
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,554
- Oh, that seems to be
a little bit of an oversight.

184
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,556
- Well, it would be.

185
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,991
Today, it would be impossible

186
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,759
because the contract
wouldn't allow it.

187
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,761
But he was creating
this orchestra,

188
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,364
so he offered
the principal chairs

189
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,267
to the heads of the department
at the university.

190
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,303
And the university hired
really good people.

191
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,607
So he was getting first-class
musicians in those chairs.

192
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,775
And, you know,
a few of them are still there,

193
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,777
but, you know,
a lot of them have retired now.

194
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,882
But that was the nucleus
for building the orchestra.

195
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,683
The string section,

196
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,919
just to try
to get enough string players.

197
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,456
You know, the program wasn't
that strong at the time.

198
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,391
The players weren't that strong,
you know.

199
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,793
So that was a challenge.

200
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,629
So anyway, you come in there,
and you figure,

201
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,164
"Well, how am I supposed to know
how to seat people

202
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,966
or where to put people,"
and all of that.

203
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,737
So I suggested that
I audition the string section.

204
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:00,440
Not make it mandatory, but just
sort of get an idea, you know,

205
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,643
and I made a couple changes,

206
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,678
and most of the people
went along with it.

207
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,780
But there was
one particular person

208
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:11,518
who who had a real problem,
and her friends got after her.

209
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:16,123
And so she lasted a season, and
then she quit, which was fine.

210
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,527
But most of it was painless,
and it was helpful.

211
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,432
And so we started,
and I remember, you know,

212
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:31,371
talking about auditions,
and they were now auditioning,

213
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,674
but not behind a screen.

214
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,277
- Which is usual today.
- Which is usual.

215
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,946
- Anonymous auditions.
- Yes, anonymous.

216
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,380
You don't wanna know the sex,

217
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,783
you don't wanna know the age,
you don't wanna know the color.

218
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,585
Nothing, you know, just
hear them play the instrument.

219
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,455
And that was interesting
because I think

220
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,458
that what happened was
fiefdoms were created, you know,

221
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:55,629
like the heads of the
departments of the university,

222
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,464
when you needed a third trumpet

223
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,334
or you needed a third oboe
or whatever you needed,

224
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,403
they chose their best students
to come in and play.

225
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,908
So I perceived it to be
what I would call a closed shop,

226
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,309
and that was fine.

227
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,144
But that's not what, you know,

228
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,780
the orchestra of the city
should be about.

229
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,382
So the first thing I announced

230
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,451
was we were gonna do
blind auditions,

231
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:20,454
'cause that's what I had been
exposed to, even at the opera.

232
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:24,157
The other thing, you know,
the other jobs I had always,

233
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,626
you know, blind auditions.

234
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,061
And they went belligerent
at first.

235
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,763
They were furious with me,
you know.

236
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,267
But when they saw how I did it,
which was to,

237
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,537
we'd pick the winner,
we'd see who they were.

238
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:40,073
And if there was some reason why
there was a problem, you know,

239
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,475
like, they shouldn't play

240
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,743
because they're difficult
to work with

241
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,911
or something like that.

242
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,846
We let that come to the surface.

243
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,148
We had, you know, they realized
that they could make input,

244
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,217
but it sort of worked.

245
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,853
I mean, it worked
right from the beginning.

246
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,288
But it was interesting

247
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,190
when these string players took
their auditions

248
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,993
because they'd come in,
and the sort of good ones

249
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,062
at the university
would play their concerto,

250
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,131
you know,
and some of it would be in tune

251
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,166
and they'd get around
the instrument really well.

252
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,168
- Norman: Good start.
- Yeah, it's a good start.

253
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,636
But when they would play--

254
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,773
So the way you do an orchestral
audition is, and actually this,

255
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,508
it's prescribed,

256
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,811
the excerpts that
each instrument will be asked

257
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:21,615
to play at an audition, and
most orchestras adhere to that.

258
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,650
So it's really the things

259
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,920
that will expose the
difficulties of the instrument.

260
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,756
And it might be 32 bars
of a Beethoven symphony

261
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:30,924
or a Mozart symphony.

262
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,593
It might, of course,

263
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,230
you're always gonna have
<i>Ein Heldenleben</i> or <i>Don Juan</i>

264
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,465
or one of these
incredibly difficult things

265
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,867
to play on the violin.

266
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,269
And so that's what's there.

267
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,672
Well, when they would get
to those excerpts and play,

268
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,608
they would all crash and burn.

269
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,310
I mean, they're
beautiful vibratos, now "Ehh."

270
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,546
I mean, it was terrible,
it was awful.

271
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,414
And so I remember
at my first rehearsal,

272
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,817
I stood up at the podium,
and I just looked at it.

273
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,118
I said, "You know,

274
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,120
"if you want your students
to play in this orchestra,

275
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,089
"tell them that
the excerpts are more important

276
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,991
than the concerto."

277
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,027
So the next year,
because, you know,

278
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,230
if you're not willing
to practice your orchestra part,

279
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,165
you don't belong in an orchestra

280
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,868
because you will
pull it down, you know?

281
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,370
And so everybody's
got to realize,

282
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,372
'cause you know, you want
everybody wants to be Heifetz.

283
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,941
But when you play in that
orchestra, those parts are hard.

284
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,576
And if you don't practice...

285
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,878
Next year,
everybody practiced, you know.

286
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,648
And then, so I think
that was the challenge.

287
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,885
And also the string section
wasn't full size.

288
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,123
And so I asked if it would be
possible to have 16, 14,

289
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,424
naively, you know?

290
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,626
I mean, there's a lot of cities
in the United States

291
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,629
that don't have 16 firsts,
14 seconds, 12 violas,

292
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,565
ten cellos, and eight basses.

293
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,766
But I didn't care about that.

294
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,768
I wanted to see
if I could have a really--

295
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,970
So they said, "Yeah,
if you can find them, you know,

296
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,138
we'll let you do it."

297
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,639
So I found them.

298
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,209
And I always pay tribute
to John Stevens

299
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,611
when he was dean
over at the university,

300
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:00,614
because he really believed
in developing the string,

301
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,882
you know, department.

302
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,050
And they, of course,

303
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,785
those excellent players
in the Pro Arte

304
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,387
and some of the individual
teachers that were there.

305
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,690
Good students started,

306
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,592
yeah, good students started
coming there,

307
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,760
and the level was growing,

308
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:17,798
but it was still, our
principal source of musicians

309
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,499
was still the
University of Wisconsin.

310
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,834
That was the principal source.

311
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:24,671
But as word got out
that the orchestra was,

312
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,040
you know,
getting better and playing,

313
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:31,578
you know, we weren't, you know,
mitigating the repertoire.

314
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,747
We were playing whatever,
you know, we wanted to play.

315
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,382
I just found a way
to rehearse it.

316
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,818
You know, my first concert,
Mahler's Symphony No. 1.

317
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:42,456
So, then people started
coming in from Chicago

318
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,092
and from, you know,
from the outlying areas.

319
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,661
And that was really great.

320
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:50,697
And I'll remember, you remember
we had Martha and Rich Blum,

321
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,433
who used to be
in the Pro Arte Quartet,

322
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,937
and she was principal second,
and he was principal viola,

323
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,840
and I think it was,
it was about the third year

324
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,875
or fourth year that I was here.

325
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:05,412
And the auditions were so good
that we had plenty of people

326
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,080
for the first violins,

327
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,416
and we could actually put
people of that level

328
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,251
in the second violin section.

329
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,553
And at the first rehearsal,

330
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,655
she jumped up and she said,
"Oh, my God,

331
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,257
I have a section behind me."
[Norman laughs]

332
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:21,195
And that's what started
to transform the orchestra.

333
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,998
And now today, they come in
from all over the country.

334
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,234
- But you make a distinction,
don't you,

335
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:31,004
between what you'd call
a weekly orchestra

336
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:35,108
and then a kind of an ad hoc
orchestra paid by the service.

337
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,376
- John: Right.

338
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:41,248
So in Europe, every city has
a full-time orchestra,

339
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,952
with retirement benefits,

340
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,221
you know, health insurance,
the whole thing,

341
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,723
all paid for
by the municipality,

342
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,058
all paid for by the government.

343
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,595
Now, they have, according
to the size of the city,

344
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,762
different level orchestras.

345
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,432
An A orchestra
would be a 96-piece orchestra.

346
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,734
A B orchestra might be
a few less players,

347
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,003
a C orchestra might be
72 players

348
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,238
in a smaller town.

349
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,307
But it's full time,
fully professional,

350
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:10,511
and supported
by the government.

351
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:16,550
In America, our full-time
orchestras are in cities that

352
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,919
have over a million population.

353
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,555
You know, so you know,
you have the, you know,

354
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:25,759
Philadelphia, Houston,
Detroit, New York, Chicago,

355
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,962
Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Seattle.

356
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,298
Of course,
there's more than ever now

357
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,300
full-time orchestras
in these big cities

358
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,801
all over the United States.

359
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,403
That wasn't the case
a hundred years ago.

360
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,739
But that's the way it is,
you know, now.

361
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,543
And so in a city
like the size of Madison,

362
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,279
we have a fully professional
orchestra.

363
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,614
The orchestra is paid every time

364
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,417
they sit down to rehearse
or play.

365
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,153
They're just not on a weekly.

366
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:58,125
And actually years ago,
that was, the schedule

367
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,726
that we play
is the same schedule

368
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,728
that the Cleveland Orchestra
played,

369
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,398
that the Pittsburgh Symphony
played before they went,

370
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,066
before this idea happened.

371
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,903
Most of it happened in the 1960s
where Ford Foundation came in

372
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,105
and was really infusing
a lot of money

373
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,342
and creating these full-time
orchestras all over the country.

374
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,612
And so, but we have
a wonderful model

375
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,949
because it's a model
that is sustainable financially

376
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,853
as well as it's really good
for creativity

377
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,187
'cause there's no burnout.

378
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,257
The 52-week orchestras
have to be careful of burnout.

379
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,093
As a matter of fact,
when Michael Stern was here,

380
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,463
we talked about the differences
of these orchestras

381
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,132
and that the orchestra
that he had for 20 years,

382
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,002
Kansas, had a 42-week season.

383
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:44,605
And he said
there were people saying,

384
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,540
"Well, can't you make it
to 52 weeks?"

385
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:47,875
And he said, "No."

386
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,944
He said, "I wouldn't trade those
10 weeks off for anything,

387
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,047
because that's what keeps the
musicians from getting burnout."

388
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,849
And they can't wait to get back
and play.

389
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,651
And they're fresh
and they're ready to go again.

390
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,052
So those are some of the little

391
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,389
inside trade-offs of all
of that.

392
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,057
- How is it all financed,
though?

393
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,493
I mean, because we
do hear occasionally, of course,

394
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,395
about orchestras
that get in trouble.

395
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:11,265
You know, Toronto, I think
was one not too long ago,

396
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,933
for example.

397
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,237
Green Bay disappeared entirely
after a hundred years or so.

398
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:20,774
And so these things
do have their day.

399
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,546
- Well, the challenge is,
I think, is to connect

400
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:29,416
with the community,
because in America,

401
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,817
everything is, you know,

402
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,086
we have ticket sales,
we have contributed income.

403
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,821
We have sometimes

404
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:36,990
some government and some,
you know,

405
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,226
a little bit of help
from foundations

406
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,561
and that kind of thing.

407
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,664
But it's mostly people
giving us donations,

408
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,733
and big ones, as well
as the ticket sales.

409
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,970
And I think that, you know,
there have been certain cities,

410
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:54,575
I think, where, you know,
you could have a bad board,

411
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,144
you could have bad
fundraising 'cause,

412
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:00,113
you know, fundraising is such
a big piece of this, you know.

413
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,015
And so you have a director
of development,

414
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,251
Casey Oelkers, you know,
with the Madison Symphony.

415
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:05,652
She's brilliant.

416
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,756
And, you know, we do fabulous
with our fundraising.

417
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:14,494
And it's very different
because I joke all the time

418
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:19,666
that when I was conducting,
like the year that I came here

419
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,103
and Barbara was moving into
the house, my wife at the time,

420
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,506
before she passed away,
she was moving into the house,

421
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,176
and I was guest conducting
an opera in Nice.

422
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:33,514
And, of course, it's
subsidized by the government.

423
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,616
So my lunch every day
was at the commissary

424
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:39,052
with the garbage collectors and
everybody else, for $2 or $3.

425
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,222
And I ate like a king, you know?
- Sure.

426
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,324
- But there were no parties.

427
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,626
There were
no development functions

428
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,227
'cause there was
no need to raise money.

429
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,229
There was no opening night
party.

430
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,632
This is all the stuff that we're
totally used to in America.

431
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,600
- You don't quite
have the ups and downs

432
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,435
that you would have
with an American orchestra.

433
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,670
- No, I mean,

434
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,339
but you don't meet
the people you're playing for.

435
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,375
You could live
in an ivory tower,

436
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,278
go do your performance,
and then disappear.

437
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,180
So I remember opening night
of <i>Attila.</i>

438
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,649
Verdi's <i>Attila</i> is was what
I was conducting.

439
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,151
The head of Glyndebourne,
Brian Dickie,

440
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:14,354
who then was at Chicago Opera
Theater for years and Toronto.

441
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,557
He came just to see the show.

442
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,158
And so we went out to a bar

443
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,694
and got drunk afterwards
and celebrated opening night.

444
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,929
But that was so different.

445
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,131
And so I always tell our donors,
I said, "You know,

446
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,667
"in Europe, you only have to be
nice to the deputy mayors

447
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,970
who dole out your subsidy
every year."

448
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:32,372
I said, "Here, I have to be nice
to all of you."

449
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,007
But it's so great because,
you know,

450
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,844
especially when you're
a town like Madison, Wisconsin,

451
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,245
the background of these people

452
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,147
who come to the symphony,
you know,

453
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,549
who has a Nobel Prize,
who has a patent, you know.

454
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,352
I mean, there's just such
a wealth of interesting people

455
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,254
that are in so many
different fields

456
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,422
and who love music

457
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,424
and wanna make music a part
of their lives.

458
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,192
Classical music.

459
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,829
- And so you,
as a selector of the music,

460
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,802
I would think would be
a little bit more,

461
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,970
correct me if I'm wrong,

462
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,838
but a little bit
more constrained

463
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,040
than one of those
European conductors

464
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:11,545
where the income is guaranteed
for the organization.

465
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:14,581
They wouldn't have to rely
quite so much

466
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:18,785
on ticket sales and ticket
sales being a significant part,

467
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,787
not just of the income,

468
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,291
but of also kind of the
public relations for a symphony,

469
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:29,229
rely those sales on
certain pieces that are draws.

470
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,398
- Right, well, let's
just back up for a second.

471
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,567
The last part
of the 20th century,

472
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,770
the big mantra was
subscriptions.

473
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,874
And I can't think
of his name at Chicago Symphony,

474
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:46,213
but he was the sort of godfather
of the idea of subscriptions,

475
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,481
are king.

476
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,683
- Guaranteed income,
at least for a year at a time.

477
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,451
- And an audience,
guaranteed audience.

478
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:53,086
You know, so, you know,

479
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,922
you're doing eight concerts
a year,

480
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,657
and somebody takes eight,

481
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,826
you know, and they get their
same seats, they, you know,

482
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,662
year after year.

483
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:05,632
And so we were filling the
concert halls with subscribers,

484
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,501
and then some single tickets.

485
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:11,205
All of a sudden, that
has completely reversed.

486
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,175
And today, the way
things are going today,

487
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:18,679
subscriptions are
not a part of the future.

488
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,681
- Why would that be?
- Because people don't wanna

489
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,517
make a commitment
a year in advance

490
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,953
to what they're gonna be doing
on Saturday night.

491
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,122
And that's what, you know,
I mean, you know,

492
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,124
when you think about it,
you go back to 1950

493
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,526
and the New York Philharmonic,

494
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:36,630
they were doing, you know,
32 concerts a year or whatever.

495
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:38,232
You know, people went
every Saturday night.

496
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,566
That's what they did.

497
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,201
And you didn't have to have,
you know,

498
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,970
4,000 people
for two performances,

499
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:44,705
6,000 people
for three performances.

500
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,473
The same people came back
all the time.

501
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,243
So your audience was
maybe only 6,000 people

502
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,677
in a city of 10 million.

503
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,480
- But you could rely on 'em.
- But you could rely on them.

504
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:54,948
Then when things started
to change,

505
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,351
they started doing half seasons,
then quarter seasons,

506
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,120
and then they had to
exponentially grow the audience,

507
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,956
so they'd start doing pops
events and, you know,

508
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,324
and all different kinds
of events,

509
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,592
because especially

510
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,128
if you're trying
to finance a 52-week orchestra

511
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,130
with pension and health

512
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:12,366
and all of those things
that go with it and recording.

513
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,534
- And competitive salaries.

514
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,802
- And the salaries,
full-time salaries.

515
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,972
So there's a big difference in,
you know,

516
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,808
not that Milwaukee
has to raise every year

517
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,145
and what we have to raise, even
though we're now at $7 million.

518
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,713
You know,
but still, you know,

519
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,383
most of the major orchestras
look from $32 million

520
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,985
to $70 million or $80 million
a year that they have to raise

521
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:33,720
to be able to sustain that.

522
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,422
So that's a challenge.

523
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,891
But that's the American system

524
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,793
as opposed
to the European system.

525
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,797
And if it ever changed
overnight in Europe,

526
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:44,965
everything would fall apart

527
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:48,402
because there's no history
of private giving.

528
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,771
- Not since, say,
Beethoven's time.

529
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,272
- John: Not since
Beethoven's time, right.

530
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:55,375
With the monarchies.
- Yeah, the benefactors.

531
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,177
- Well, they were
the government, in a way.

532
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,345
- That's true, they were.

533
00:22:58,412 --> 00:22:59,713
They were just
absolute government.

534
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,114
- Absolute government,
so they did it.

535
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:03,951
I think nothing has changed.
[both laugh]

536
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,619
- Goes around,
comes around and all that.

537
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,588
But getting back
to the repertory,

538
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,724
how does that need to sell
a certain number of tickets

539
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,593
determine what you,
John DeMain,

540
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,828
as the artistic director
and conductor

541
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:15,996
of the Madison Symphony,

542
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,665
how does it affect
what you select,

543
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,901
not just the repertory, but
of course, the soloists, too.

544
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:22,703
- John: Well, it's changing.

545
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,974
I mean, it's changing
because first of all,

546
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,543
for example,
single ticket sales,

547
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,345
both the opera and the symphony

548
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:35,883
are currently experiencing
a huge ticket sale

549
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:40,521
on the day of the actual concert
or the day before.

550
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,990
So you're going into these
programs not knowing

551
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:45,392
whether anybody's gonna come,
and sometimes they don't,

552
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,094
sometimes they do.

553
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,495
That's a change.

554
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,264
So then you're trying
to say, "Well,

555
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,232
okay, what's going to get
them in?"

556
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,468
Because now we don't,
because with the subscription,

557
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:57,838
a guaranteed audience, you
sort of play whatever you want.

558
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:59,840
You still,
if you want them to renew,

559
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:02,042
you still have got to give them
the reason

560
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,611
why they fell in love
with symphonic music.

561
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,414
- And a lot of it has to do
with brand names, doesn't it?

562
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,016
- Yeah, sure.
- I mean, familiar things.

563
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,185
- I mean, Beethoven,
but don't forget,

564
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:14,855
there was all of that
European migration to America

565
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:18,425
and all of that history in
those people's lives and work.

566
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:20,227
And, you know,
and I look at, you know,

567
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,129
during the Second World War

568
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:24,164
when all the Jewish people
came over here, you know,

569
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,133
and I mean, for them,

570
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,671
their very soul depended on
hearing classical music

571
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:31,839
and opera.

572
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,574
I mean, it was
nourishment for their soul,

573
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,110
and their life was
bereft without it.

574
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:42,249
Today, we're looking
at several generations now

575
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,151
who have, not necessarily here.

576
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,553
I mean, Madison has
music education in the schools

577
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,055
and in the outlying areas,

578
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:50,624
but so many pockets
around the country

579
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:52,893
do not have music education
in the schools.

580
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,229
And so when those people come
and move here,

581
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:57,130
they don't have that
in their background.

582
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,832
They don't need it.

583
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,535
They don't know about
classical music.

584
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:03,203
So we're facing now

585
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,474
a whole couple generations
that have not had the benefit

586
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,710
of music education, you know.

587
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,912
And so how do we reach them?

588
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:15,148
And not only that,
but as an organization,

589
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,551
most symphony orchestras
and opera companies

590
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:18,819
have been remiss

591
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:21,555
where equity, diversity,
and inclusion was concerned.

592
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:25,926
So all of that
is revolutionizing the approach

593
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,561
that we are taking.

594
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:30,264
But still, you know, I mean,

595
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,166
our musicians trained
to play hard stuff, right?

596
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,968
I mean, you know,
horn players want to play

597
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,571
Mahler and Bruckner and Strauss,

598
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:40,874
and we want,
and Beethoven is just,

599
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,179
I mean, you can't say symphony
without saying Beethoven,

600
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:48,949
you know, and Beethoven,
and all of these masterpieces,

601
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,417
they continue
to be masterpieces.

602
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:53,153
There's nothing,
nothing has made

603
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,189
Beethoven less than Beethoven.

604
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:56,356
- And it's true.

605
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:59,293
And you could look at it
on paper and say,

606
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,729
"Oh, you know,
<i>Pastoral Symphony,</i> ho hum."

607
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:05,599
But then when you get there,
it wins you over all over again.

608
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,134
- Oh, it's so brilliant.

609
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,469
I mean, and he had
a way of connecting,

610
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,238
I think, with the common man

611
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:14,575
and still wrote
very complex music, you know.

612
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,845
But his melodies and the fact
that he had a voice.

613
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,613
You know, you always know

614
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,648
when you're listening to
Beethoven, or most of the time.

615
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:24,251
- A lot of times, it sounds like
you're listening to an anthem.

616
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,419
- Yeah, right.

617
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:26,787
I mean, it's just phenomenal.

618
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:30,190
So I think,
and those are the reasons

619
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,359
why people fell in love
with music.

620
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,760
You know,
they would hear these pieces,

621
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,063
and they'd fall in love
with them.

622
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:38,398
And I think we also
went through a very bad patch

623
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,334
in the second half,
I've said before,

624
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,035
in the second half
of the 20th century

625
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:46,206
with a lot of ugly music,
you know, music that was,

626
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:49,409
that was designed
not to have any form,

627
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,512
shape, or recognizable thing
to it

628
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:53,547
that for an audience
to hook into,

629
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,783
and following
a kind of philosophy

630
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,619
that these composers
are writing for themselves

631
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:00,187
and screw the audience.

632
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:05,092
- Yeah, and that does raise
a whole interesting approach,

633
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,260
doesn't it?

634
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:08,328
Because you could say
that music is

635
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:13,333
either written for the composer
or for the performer

636
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,068
or for the audience.
- John: Right.

637
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,370
- Sometimes it's all three.

638
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:18,539
Sometimes, as you say,
John, it's just for the composer

639
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,207
or just for the performer.

640
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,110
- Well, I think
when you look back in history,

641
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:26,813
when composers wrote pieces
and they weren't successful,

642
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,815
they were devastated.

643
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:31,151
Bizet was devastated that <i>Carmen</i>
wasn't a hit

644
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,653
the first time it played.

645
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,655
Rachmaninoff
went into a deep depression.

646
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:37,024
- Yes, before he got hypnotized.

647
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,127
- So they wanted to connect
with their audience.

648
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:42,329
You know, I always like
to remind everybody that I think

649
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,932
that Beethoven is the father
of serious listening,

650
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,434
because, you know,
we use this idea,

651
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,369
this terrible term,
classical music.

652
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:50,537
What does that mean?

653
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:51,738
Because we write a piece
yesterday,

654
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,507
so suddenly it's classical.

655
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:55,542
It's concert music,
you know?

656
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,180
And those opening chords
of <i>Eroica--</i> bomp, bomp!

657
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,484
It's sort of like,
"Stop talking, listen up.

658
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,687
We're going on a journey."

659
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:10,424
And he really was the one
who started

660
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,892
moving into the concert halls

661
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,262
and started really listening
at the compositions,

662
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,897
and that developed from there.

663
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:20,067
So Beethoven for me is,
you know,

664
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,336
the icon of symphonic music,

665
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:24,605
even though we have Haydn
and Mozart and all of that.

666
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:27,574
But what Beethoven did with
those nine symphonies was just,

667
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,009
you know, extraordinary.

668
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:32,412
But it was also the whole idea
of how you experienced a concert

669
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,048
and how you, you know,
you didn't casually have a drink

670
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,317
and walk around like
you did in the, you know,

671
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,186
the Renaissance and, you know.

672
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:41,455
- Or in Beethoven's time
for that matter, too often.

673
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:45,192
Yeah, I mean, there's
a wonderful story about him.

674
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:50,497
I think he was just playing solo
for some high-rolling patrons

675
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,366
and their friends.

676
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:57,804
They were chatting as he played,
and he got up and said,

677
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,440
"Fr solche Schweinen
spiele ich nicht."

678
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,944
"I will not play for such pigs,"
and walked out.

679
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,112
[both laugh]

680
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,647
So...

681
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,515
- On the other hand,

682
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:10,784
there's been a big discussion
recently about

683
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,420
whether we should applaud
in between movements.

684
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:15,589
- And that is
an interesting phenomenon.

685
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:20,427
Now, let me give you my two
cents' worth before you tell us.

686
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,229
- John: I give you
my two cents' worth.

687
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:25,365
[both laugh]
- More than that.

688
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,934
I tend to think of applause,

689
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,468
and usually,
of course you don't,

690
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,970
the composer doesn't expect,

691
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:32,573
or the performer, applause
in between movements

692
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,676
of a three or four-minute
movement concerto or symphony,

693
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:38,278
for example,
or a suite for that matter.

694
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:43,150
However, and the audience
doesn't really, you know,

695
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:48,789
a really familiar audience will
not applaud between movements.

696
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,325
However, if you hear
applause between movements,

697
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:53,827
to me, it implies
that those are people

698
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,697
who are fairly new
to classical music.

699
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:59,933
And to me,
then it's a positive thing.

700
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,004
- Yes, but I also think that
this idea of not applauding.

701
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:06,540
So I didn't realize
until recently

702
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:10,811
that so often after the
second movement of a concerto

703
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:13,480
in a three-movement concerto,
it says on the bottom,

704
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:17,684
"attacca," which means go right
to the third movement.

705
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:20,387
It doesn't say that
after the first movement.

706
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:24,191
And we know historically
that they didn't play the second

707
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,326
and third movements right
after they played the first.

708
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:27,728
- They put other stuff
in between.

709
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:31,398
- Right, and if you listen to
the endings of first movements,

710
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:33,600
they demand applause.

711
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,403
- Right, they're so dramatic.
- The Greek,

712
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,608
I mean, how cruel it is to play
the finale of the first movement

713
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,545
of the Tchaikovsky
Violin Concerto to silence.

714
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:47,147
So, I mean,
I think the time has come.

715
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:48,348
If you feel like applauding,
applaud.

716
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,018
But you don't--
and so, okay.

717
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,887
So don't applaud
after the slow second movement.

718
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:56,823
I think the idea of
not applauding between movements

719
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,560
really should go
to the idea,

720
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,497
yeah, to the idea
that when song cycles and things

721
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:07,167
have a theme and you're trying
to create, you know, this,

722
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:09,002
that you don't interrupt it
with this noise

723
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:12,573
and you allow this whole thing
to affect you and take over.

724
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,975
Right, but I think it's
a little different

725
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,143
with concertos.

726
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,378
And I think symphonies,

727
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,547
you probably don't
have to applaud as much.

728
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:23,417
But concertos are designed
to dazzle.

729
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:26,653
- Of course, what is it,
Tchaikovsky's Sixth

730
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,388
that ends the,

731
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:32,326
next to the last movement,
very dramatically.

732
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,094
Everybody applauds and then,
oh, guess what,

733
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,529
there's a quiet finale.

734
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:38,398
- Well, because that's
what it does to you, you know.

735
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,234
And so, applaud.

736
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,768
What are we being fussy about?

737
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,570
You know, come
and have a good time.

738
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:45,939
- Well, and I would
think that,

739
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:49,109
given your extensive
operatic background,

740
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:50,777
you would particularly feel
that way, John,

741
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:54,314
because in opera,
you know, hit the high note,

742
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:55,482
everybody applauds.

743
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,718
They go crazy,
you know, everything stops.

744
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:58,886
Yeah, it's a story line.

745
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:02,556
But yeah, it's
a different kind of conduct.

746
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:06,293
- In some instances,
you know, encores.

747
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:11,265
- Norman: Right, yes,
let's hear that again.

748
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:14,067
- Right, but I think,
so I think, you know,

749
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,235
but you're right.

750
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:16,637
We're trying to get
new people in,

751
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:18,939
and I think it's, I mean,

752
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,076
I think it's important when you
have these single ticket sales

753
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,546
that you still do
interesting work,

754
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,881
but I think it's important
to make sure that you have

755
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,285
something that the audience
recognizes on the card.

756
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:33,620
At least that's some of the
advice I've been given recently.

757
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:35,956
Make sure that there's
something that they know,

758
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:37,758
and then they'll give you
a break on listening

759
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:39,760
to something they don't know,
and maybe find out

760
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:42,296
that it's really interesting
and intriguing.

761
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:45,933
So, but we're trying
to figure this out

762
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,802
because I do think
that there's, with the dawn

763
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,573
of single ticket sales
actually growing to the extent

764
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:57,945
that they are and subscriptions
eroding for social reasons,

765
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:01,782
you know, more than anything,
that it's demanding

766
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,483
that we look at repertoire.

767
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,985
But repertoire changes
over time.

768
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:06,987
You know,
when you look at the operas

769
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:09,790
that the Metropolitan Opera
was doing in 1900 and 1950

770
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,391
and what they're doing today,

771
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,126
there's certain pieces
that were in vogue

772
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:15,062
that went out of fashion,
came back in.

773
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,664
You know, certain pieces
have always been there,

774
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,167
but repertoire changes.

775
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,569
And so I think we have to look
at the symphonic world

776
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,304
the same way.

777
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,406
But, and also,

778
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,809
I think we have to do
our own job of maybe trying

779
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:32,079
to help our audiences know
how to listen to this music.

780
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,247
You know, I mean,

781
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:36,183
I'm pushing for,
I'm sort of blasphemous,

782
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,918
but I'm sort of pushing that

783
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:41,188
we closed-circuit televise
our concerts.

784
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:42,589
So when an audience
is sitting there,

785
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,225
it looks like when they're
watching <i>Final Forte</i> at home,

786
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,327
you know,
and when the pianist is playing,

787
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:50,364
the whole audience can watch his
hands if they want to, you know?

788
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,268
And when the oboist is playing,
you actually could see the oboe.

789
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:57,004
And, you know,
the way we do for other people.

790
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,140
So we would help people, you
know, journey through the music

791
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:04,311
and give their eyes something
to do because life is different.

792
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,281
And when I've proposed this idea
over the years,

793
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:10,584
you know, the older generation
is really content

794
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,387
to sit there and just listen.

795
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:16,490
But that's not the way the
new generation is growing up.

796
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:19,026
Visuals are a part
of their experience.

797
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,395
And so, that's something

798
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,597
that I think we need to look at
for the future.

799
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:27,367
- There are ensembles, the
North Corner Chamber Orchestra,

800
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,703
for example, and I think also,

801
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,405
Portland Baroque out
in Oregon,

802
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:35,642
if I remember right, will
actually stream their concerts.

803
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,044
- Stream their concerts?

804
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,445
- Yeah, so livestreaming.

805
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:42,049
And sure, you know,
you might have audience,

806
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:44,051
potential audience that would be
sitting at home

807
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:47,988
instead of in the hall
where you, I assume,

808
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:50,657
get more excited as performers
if you have a full house.

809
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,059
- John: Well,
we haven't, you know,

810
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,627
we finally have a contract now,

811
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:57,064
a media agreement that
will allow us for streaming.

812
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,467
During COVID,
we couldn't stream music.

813
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,803
We could stream--
anybody could talk,

814
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,805
but nobody could play a note
because we did not

815
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:09,142
have an agreement with
our musicians for streaming.

816
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:13,113
Before COVID,
we never saw the need for it.

817
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,016
And so in a way, we
were caught with our pants down.

818
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,619
So now, we have the ability
to do it,

819
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,621
but we don't want to shoot
ourselves in the foot.

820
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:22,422
We still want buns in seats,
as we say.

821
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:23,757
- That's right.
- You know.

822
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:28,829
And so, but people have
been going to hear us for years,

823
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:33,033
and now maybe they're in
a long-term facility, you know,

824
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,235
where they can't travel anymore
and all of that.

825
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,904
The idea for them
being able to see

826
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,473
and hear something that they
really loved all their lives,

827
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,807
that's terrific.

828
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:43,710
And also the idea of maybe
taking an education concert

829
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:45,012
that you're doing,

830
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:47,614
and you could send it to
some place in northern Wisconsin

831
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,449
that might not have
an opportunity

832
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:50,717
to hear this kind of thing.

833
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:55,489
You know, there's a lot
of potential for streaming.

834
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:56,890
- What does
the Madison Symphony do

835
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,225
for outreach, though?

836
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:02,062
I mean, if there is somebody
up in Minocqua or, you know,

837
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:05,599
Solon Springs or someplace,
who's not likely to come

838
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:10,504
to Madison, or we'll even say
Milwaukee for a symphony,

839
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:13,173
how do you bring the music
to them, live music?

840
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,875
Do you have smaller ensembles

841
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,476
that go out as kind of
missionary groups

842
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:17,644
to spread the word?

843
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:19,513
- Well, we've been doing
a little bit recently

844
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,149
with some community concerts
in our own area,

845
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:24,718
but we haven't gone way out
of town, you know.

846
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:25,986
And we're doing some

847
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:30,791
where we take the orchestra
to different group areas.

848
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:31,959
And of course,

849
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,395
I think <i>Final Forte</i> has,
you know, statewide,

850
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:36,563
and that's really good.

851
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,765
And I think we want to do
a little bit more,

852
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,567
you know, try
to do a little bit more

853
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,569
with that sort of thing.

854
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:46,607
But we don't really, I mean,
we're pretty much focused on,

855
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:48,208
you know, the Dane County

856
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,410
and this sort of
southwestern region.

857
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,514
And so we're
not really doing much right now,

858
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,518
I don't think,
to try to get people up in...

859
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:00,454
- Yeah, I suppose you do have to
kind of identify

860
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,122
your target audience there.

861
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,423
- Also, because it's costly.

862
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,392
I mean, you know,
to stream, it's not free.

863
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:07,427
I mean,
the musicians have to be paid.

864
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:10,697
And so, you know,
and then, you know,

865
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:13,166
how much do you charge people
to be able to stream?

866
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:16,270
Is everything free,
or, you know.

867
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:19,239
So I think we're still
at the dawn of that,

868
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,407
you know what I mean?

869
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:21,808
I just think we're
at the beginning

870
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,443
of how to do all of that.

871
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,179
- How do you
go about, again,

872
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,047
you're the one selecting
the music.

873
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:30,784
How do you go about selecting
a soloist?

874
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,488
You decide first, "I wanna
hear the Grieg Piano Concerto."

875
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,757
Or do you decide,
"I wanna hear Garrick Ohlsson."

876
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:38,792
- John: No, I want to hear
Garrick Ohlsson.

877
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:39,993
I don't care what he plays.

878
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,461
No, I do care what he plays.

879
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,130
I'm just kidding,
no, I wanna hear him.

880
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:47,434
So I think, you know, over the
years, the Madison Symphony has,

881
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:49,636
as part of their endowment,
the Steenbock,

882
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:50,971
I think gift or something.

883
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:54,074
It was one of those gifts
in the endowment was to bring in

884
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,809
important guest artists.

885
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,979
And Roland had great soloists,
my predecessor.

886
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:01,014
I mean, he brought
some really fine artists here.

887
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,350
And so that's always been
a part of our mix.

888
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,652
But I think what we do is,

889
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:09,189
you know, we let
the agents know.

890
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:12,192
The whole idea of artists'
agents has changed, too,

891
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:15,929
because some of these
big artists now,

892
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:18,732
their agents are based
in London, based in Europe,

893
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,101
because the American scene
has gone much more pop

894
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,203
and much more, you know,

895
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,973
you know, Columbia Artists is
not the Columbia Artists

896
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,307
it was 25, 30 years ago.

897
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:30,711
- No, it was quite
the enterprise...

898
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,347
- Enterprise, sure.

899
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,349
- ...releasing
a lot of recordings.

900
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:38,519
- So now we've got to negotiate
with an agent in London

901
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:42,155
and hope that he has
that artist's European

902
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:45,659
or international schedule as
well as getting them to come.

903
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:50,631
So what we do is once we get
our dates in Overture Hall,

904
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:56,570
and we try to keep them
pretty consistent every year

905
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:59,039
about the sort of week
that they're gonna fall on.

906
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:01,608
Every now and then,
we have to get out of their way

907
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,210
if they're gonna bring
in a <i>Lion King</i>

908
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,245
or a <i>Wicked</i> or a <i>Hamilton</i>

909
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:08,382
or some big show that they could
sell a month worth of tickets,

910
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:11,718
and then we, you know,
we work around that

911
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:13,520
because we want them
to be successful.

912
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:18,192
But, so we get the dates,
and then there's agents

913
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:20,727
that we like to deal with,
but not exclusively,

914
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:23,730
but we let, you know,
the big agencies know

915
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:27,367
that we can afford
to pay basically for any soloist

916
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,535
who wants to come here.

917
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:29,937
Not on a one night, one off.

918
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,104
We don't want that.

919
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:33,574
- Because you do
three concerts, Friday,

920
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,042
Saturday night,
and Sunday afternoon.

921
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:38,545
- Right, and we want the artists
to come and play for all three,

922
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,380
'cause if we, you know,
so we don't--

923
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:44,084
So we shy away
from single performances.

924
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,586
We do them from time to time,

925
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:48,856
but we shy away from that
because usually that's a gala

926
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:51,058
and that's very expensive
ticket prices.

927
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:53,427
And then they don't come to
the next subscription concert.

928
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:55,662
So you don't want to shoot
yourself in the foot.

929
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,631
And we built up this,

930
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:01,001
this audience, which is today
a challenge since COVID.

931
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:05,606
But we build up our audiences
by having this artist play

932
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,241
for all three performances.

933
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:08,675
You know, when I got here,

934
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,177
we were doing
Saturday nights,

935
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:13,480
eight Saturday nights,
seven and Christmas,

936
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,582
you know, which was
more like a pops concert.

937
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:20,921
And then, I had always, when
I was at Houston Grand Opera,

938
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:24,024
I always loved
the Sunday matinee performance.

939
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,792
There was something
about that audience, you know.

940
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,361
They were rested.

941
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,762
They were there
to hear the music.

942
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,564
It was the last thing
they were gonna do

943
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:31,798
before they prepared
for the week,

944
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,834
and they already put
last week behind them.

945
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,202
So it was a great audience.

946
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,603
And I thought, you know,

947
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,706
we've got this lousy weather
in the winter here in Madison.

948
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,476
And, you know, people don't want
to drive home late at night

949
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,810
on a Saturday night.

950
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:45,679
And besides, there's
a lot of revelers out there

951
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:46,947
on a Saturday night.

952
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:49,316
So I said, "We should do
a Sunday matinee."

953
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:52,920
So the first year I did the
Beethoven Ninth and Christmas.

954
00:40:52,986 --> 00:40:55,522
I repeated those two on Sunday.

955
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:58,158
The next year, I added two more,
and the next year two more.

956
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,993
And then by the fourth year,

957
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,896
we were offering subscription,
and we had 300 or 400 people

958
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:05,265
to start with,
and then it really took off.

959
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:09,603
And now, Sunday afternoon is
our biggest audience.

960
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,105
- Let's talk a little bit
about demographics then.

961
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:15,108
I mean, you might see
the numbers behind the scenes,

962
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:18,745
but you're out there on
the stage facing that audience,

963
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,347
addressing them often.

964
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:22,883
Usually, in fact,
at the beginning of a concert

965
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,787
and maybe at the beginning
of the second part.

966
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:32,159
Do you have a sense of is
the audience collectively aging,

967
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:33,660
are you filling it in?

968
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:36,930
Is it kind of picking up
younger audiences

969
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,565
in a significant number?

970
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,467
- I think opera is.

971
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:41,969
- Getting younger audiences?

972
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,138
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
it's visual.

973
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,541
You know, <i>The Barber of Seville</i>
had a lot of young people,

974
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:50,210
which we had just done,
you know, this past year.

975
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:54,014
And <i>Candide</i> had
a lot of young people.

976
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,550
I mean, we're seeing
younger people at the opera.

977
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,786
I think it's important
to remember that back in 1950,

978
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,457
I think it was, the
Chicago Symphony surveyed...

979
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,825
- Norman: It was research?

980
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:06,059
- ...the audience, you know,

981
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,061
and they found out
that the audience was the age

982
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:09,229
that the audience is today.

983
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:10,764
There's no difference.

984
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:14,067
And I feel that
it's very important

985
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:18,639
that kids in college
have a really good experience

986
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,208
as part of their education,
you know, learning about opera,

987
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:23,911
learning about symphony,
Broadway, whatever.

988
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:25,245
Jazz, whatever they do,
you know.

989
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:27,181
And whatever they do
while they're dating, you know,

990
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:28,949
having really good date nights.

991
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:30,651
Then they get married
and they have kids.

992
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,852
What do you have to do?

993
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,654
You got to go to all
those kids' concerts

994
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,689
and all their games
and all of that,

995
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,591
and everything costs money,
you know.

996
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,893
And so, with exception,

997
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:44,231
people don't do the things they
did when they were courting.

998
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:45,599
They're doing the things

999
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,434
that they need to do
to raise a family

1000
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:49,937
and hopefully giving
these kids a good chance.

1001
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:54,575
So my theory is that
once they're out of the nest

1002
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:58,178
and actually
after college is paid for,

1003
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:02,115
there, you're looking at people
who are now 55,

1004
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:03,350
you know, 60 years old.

1005
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,552
They have
some discretionary income now,

1006
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,055
and they'll go back
to doing the things they did

1007
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,923
when they were younger.

1008
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,426
The problem is that if
those people don't have

1009
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:13,727
any music education,

1010
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,796
they're not gonna go back
to going to symphony concerts

1011
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:18,298
if they don't have
any classical music education.

1012
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:23,036
You know, but, or we have
to entice them to try it out

1013
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,839
and to experience it.

1014
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:28,575
And so, we're looking
right now at the idea

1015
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:32,012
of, how can we make going
to a concert an event.

1016
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,680
'Cause the other thing
to happen with COVID

1017
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,016
is that people found out that
they could entertain themselves

1018
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,818
without ever leaving their home.

1019
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:39,653
- To a certain extent anyway.

1020
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,488
After two or three years,

1021
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:43,757
you would think maybe
they were eager to get back out.

1022
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:45,225
- Well, you'd think they would.

1023
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:48,428
I mean, I would imagine that if
you're in that older age group

1024
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,497
and you have
a pre-existing condition,

1025
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:52,432
you're wary of being
in public spaces.

1026
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:55,102
And I think, I don't know
that scientifically,

1027
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,538
but I know it anecdotally,
that there are people

1028
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:58,739
who are not coming right now

1029
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:00,807
because they don't wanna be
in a public space.

1030
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:02,543
It doesn't seem
to bother young people, though.

1031
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:05,546
You know, rock concerts
are packed and all that.

1032
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:06,880
- So true.

1033
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:10,050
- But it's different with
an older group that feel more,

1034
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:12,419
you know, health threatened.

1035
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:14,421
- Well, the one thing
about the opera,

1036
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:17,591
I'm just hypothetically thinking
here, though,

1037
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:20,894
is more so
than a symphony concert,

1038
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:24,031
in addition to being
something beautiful,

1039
00:44:24,097 --> 00:44:26,633
an opera for the most part
is also, you can look at it

1040
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,371
as an athletic event
because it demands such power

1041
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,311
and accuracy and timing
and finesse and presence.

1042
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:41,615
- You are so right.

1043
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:44,017
I always said two things.

1044
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,655
Opera is your life
sung back at you,

1045
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:51,158
and opera is the Olympics
of singing.

1046
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:52,526
- Uh-huh.
[laughs]

1047
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:57,097
- Those are the two things
that I think make opera special.

1048
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:58,332
You have to develop,

1049
00:44:58,398 --> 00:45:00,567
I mean, you're not hearing
that kind of singing,

1050
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:02,269
you know, on the airwaves.
- Right.

1051
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:04,538
- And so it might be
kind of a shock,

1052
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:06,039
but usually when you go

1053
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:08,709
and you realize there are
no microphones out there

1054
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:11,111
and these people make
this giant sound by just,

1055
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:14,147
you know, what they do
with their, you know,

1056
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,350
physiognomy, you know,
to be able to do all that,

1057
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,218
it's just amazing.

1058
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:20,053
But it's the same thing.

1059
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,522
The problem is caring.

1060
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,590
We know that there's
a big difference

1061
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:26,960
between live performance
and recorded performance.

1062
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:29,062
But when you have
fabulous recording equipment

1063
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:34,401
in your house and, you know,
and I think it's a problem.

1064
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:38,539
I think we experience
too much of life now virtually.

1065
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:41,041
- Yes, you can certainly make,
because more all the time.

1066
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,643
- You sit in front
of that camera,

1067
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:44,344
TV set and play endless games

1068
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,346
and have all
these fabulous visuals,

1069
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,449
and there's great music a lot of
times going on at the same time.

1070
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,885
But, you know, it's virtual,
virtual, virtual.

1071
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:56,290
And so, we've got to make
going to a live concert

1072
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:01,795
an event
that has a wonderful aura to it.

1073
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,932
You know,
from the time you walk in,

1074
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:07,534
the time you leave home until
the time you go home, basically.

1075
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:09,803
And what is it like
when you walk into that lobby?

1076
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,105
What can we do
after those concerts are over?

1077
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:14,508
What can we, so that
you don't wanna miss it.

1078
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:18,245
You know, so we're introducing
an idea for the centennial,

1079
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:21,782
which I'm not allowed
to say just yet,

1080
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,152
but I think with young people,

1081
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:28,522
I don't think we should worry
too much about that.

1082
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:32,526
I mean, we know that the
audience is made up of people

1083
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:35,028
who have have a relationship
with music.

1084
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:36,797
So, you know, you look at WYSO,

1085
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:38,298
you look at the
Madison Youth choirs,

1086
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:41,235
you look at all these wonderful
things for youth in this city,

1087
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:45,105
you know, and they do come
to the concerts as well.

1088
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:48,141
But by the same token,
if you don't have any contact,

1089
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,877
if you never sang in a choir,

1090
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:52,045
you didn't take a piano lesson,
you didn't,

1091
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:55,249
then how do you become
attracted to what we do?

1092
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,451
And how can we make
you attracted to what we do?

1093
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:59,086
- Norman: You make it
a social event.

1094
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:00,487
- Make it a social event.

1095
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:05,826
And I think also, maybe we do
some music appreciation online.

1096
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:08,595
I think we could do more of
that, not just playing a piece,

1097
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:14,201
but actually giving sort of
classes of musical appreciation.

1098
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:16,937
- Which of course you do,
but on site

1099
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,805
with the pre-concert talks

1100
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:21,375
and also your introductions
to some of the pieces,

1101
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:23,944
especially
the contemporary ones.

1102
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,046
Another component of this draw,

1103
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:29,383
though, I would say
would be the venue itself,

1104
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:32,252
and that would be, in the case
of the Madison Symphony,

1105
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,623
the Overture Center
for the Arts, and 2004,

1106
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,092
I believe, it was inaugurated.

1107
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,727
- John: We are celebrating
our 20th anniversary,

1108
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:41,895
being in that hall.

1109
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:44,431
- Norman: And you were,
to some extent, involved

1110
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:46,700
in the very design of the hall.

1111
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,368
You were consulted
to some extent.

1112
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:50,971
- John: So backing up to when
I got here and the challenges

1113
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,307
when I got here,
I learned early on

1114
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,643
that the Oscar Mayer was
a very inferior space

1115
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,712
for classical music.

1116
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,615
I would say that a lot of our
donors didn't know that

1117
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,418
because they sat up
in the dress circle,

1118
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:07,454
and the sound in the dress
circle was really excellent,

1119
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:10,224
but the sound underneath
the balcony was frightening.

1120
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,558
- Yeah, notoriously so.

1121
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:12,726
- Frightening.

1122
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:14,995
And if anybody came there,
sat there,

1123
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:18,599
they'd never come back because
it sounded like, I mean...

1124
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:20,367
- Norman: Just kind of
deadened, wasn't it?

1125
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:23,570
- It cut into the overtones
of the orchestra

1126
00:48:23,637 --> 00:48:27,641
so that they sounded
horrifically out of tune,

1127
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,644
like the worst student orchestra
you've ever heard.

1128
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:31,912
It was unbelievable.

1129
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:35,449
And I went
to an educational concert

1130
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:36,717
that I wasn't conducting.

1131
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:38,685
Beverly was conducting
'cause I had something else,

1132
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,687
but I got back in time
to see the performance,

1133
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,422
and I sat underneath
the balcony,

1134
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,458
speakers in the ceiling,

1135
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:48,795
this horrifically, horrifically
out of tune orchestra,

1136
00:48:48,862 --> 00:48:51,064
and I ran upstairs
and sat in the mezzanine,

1137
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,666
and I thought I was
at Carnegie Hall.

1138
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,735
I mean, day and night.

1139
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:58,438
So then we thought, "Well,
what do we do about that?"

1140
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,841
So the first thing we did
is we looked at the Orpheum.

1141
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:03,210
But the Orpheum
has the same issue.

1142
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,646
So when we
when we asked acousticians

1143
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:07,981
to evaluate the Orpheum Theater,
they said,

1144
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:10,317
"We can maybe get you
from a three to a five,

1145
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:12,486
but you still, we'll
never get you to a 10."

1146
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:13,687
- Well, the Orpheum is, what,

1147
00:49:13,754 --> 00:49:15,355
about a hundred years old
at this point?

1148
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:17,658
- Yeah, but it also
has all those seats

1149
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:18,825
underneath the balcony.

1150
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:21,929
So it has a different scallop
to the ceiling.

1151
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:24,965
It was more for live performance
than than the Capitol Theater,

1152
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:26,700
which was the name of the--

1153
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:28,669
- Oscar Mayer originally.
- Yeah.

1154
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:30,370
So, you know,
and the stagehands

1155
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:34,274
used to call it Wiener Hall,
and I used to call it Dog Hall

1156
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:35,943
because I thought
it was really--

1157
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:38,779
- But you still wanted
the buns in the seats?

1158
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:40,247
- Not in those seats.
[Norman laughs]

1159
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,448
I used to go to marketing,

1160
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:43,217
and I'd say,
"Please don't sell those seats.

1161
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:46,820
Get them all upstairs
and in the front."

1162
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:49,122
So anyway,
then we found out

1163
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:52,793
that Pleasant was going to sell
the American Girl doll,

1164
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,128
and that we knew that
she was interested in the arts

1165
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:59,933
and her help with getting the
Concerts on the Square started,

1166
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,768
and, you know,
and bringing people

1167
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:03,971
back downtown and all of that.

1168
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:08,642
And she sort of knew
that people would come at her

1169
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:11,411
from all sides,
you know, once this got out that

1170
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,781
she was selling the company,
she and her husband.

1171
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:18,352
So they jump-started
the whole thing by suggesting

1172
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:20,420
that the executive directors

1173
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:23,690
of the different
professional organizations

1174
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:25,959
get together and dream.

1175
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,127
What would you like?

1176
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,295
Who would your partners be?

1177
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:29,463
What would happen?

1178
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,633
And out of that, I mean,
we first at the symphony

1179
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,935
thought we'd love to have
a dedicated concert hall,

1180
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:37,271
which meant you
could only do concerts.

1181
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:40,040
Well, the only partner
we could have in that,

1182
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:44,178
that would use up
enough nights in the year

1183
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:46,513
would be the University
of Wisconsin.

1184
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,183
And they were playing
in a 700-seat house,

1185
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:50,717
you know, on campus.

1186
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:52,686
What's that called?

1187
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,155
- There's Mills.
- Mills.

1188
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:58,358
They were playing in Mills
before the new hall was built.

1189
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:03,197
And they sort of felt
to be in 1,850-seat concert hall

1190
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:04,698
with 500 people, you know,

1191
00:51:04,765 --> 00:51:06,300
they said,
"If 500 people come to Mills,

1192
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:09,236
it looks like a sellout,"
if 500 people come.

1193
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:11,171
So they weren't interested
in partnering with us.

1194
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:14,074
So to make a long story
a little less long,

1195
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:16,276
our partners were gonna be
the same.

1196
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:20,047
It was gonna be Broadway,
and it was gonna be opera.

1197
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:23,951
So we were gonna, we wanted
then a multi-purpose hall,

1198
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:26,887
but that had real acoustics
for live music

1199
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:28,789
and would address the problems.

1200
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:30,924
So that's what came out
of all of this,

1201
00:51:30,991 --> 00:51:33,093
was the Overture Center
of the Arts.

1202
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,165
And, you know, when Csar Pelli
was chosen to be the architect,

1203
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:41,168
I probably played a little bit
of a role in that

1204
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:45,439
because we knew we had money
to build the hall.

1205
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:50,477
We were down to the final stages
of choosing an architect.

1206
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:52,479
The Pacific Symphony out
in Orange County

1207
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:54,214
wanted to build a hall,

1208
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:58,719
and they had engaged
Csar Pelli to be the architect,

1209
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,320
but they didn't have
the money together yet.

1210
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:04,758
So I went to a fundraiser
where Csar Pelli spoke,

1211
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:06,426
and he talked about the fact

1212
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:09,496
that he never put a brick
in place

1213
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:12,466
without consulting
with an acoustician.

1214
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,001
And that was music to my ears.

1215
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:15,169
- Norman: Literally.

1216
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,338
- So I said,
I let Pleasant know, you know,

1217
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:20,741
that he had made that speech
or that he had said that,

1218
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:23,877
and she liked him, you know, and
eventually that's who we got.

1219
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:26,914
I also think
to Bob D'Angelo's credit,

1220
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,650
who was running
the Civic Center at the time,

1221
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:31,385
the Oscar Mayer,

1222
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:36,690
that we were kept abreast of all
the stages of development.

1223
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:38,325
One of the things we did

1224
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:41,628
is we went to view other concert
halls around the country,

1225
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:44,031
including one that
Pelli had done

1226
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:45,899
in Charlotte, North Carolina,

1227
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:49,770
which was sort of a role model
for the one that we have here.

1228
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:52,239
And then we went out
to see my hall

1229
00:52:52,306 --> 00:52:53,841
'cause I was
with Opera Pacific, you know,

1230
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:56,944
out in Orange County,
and when Pleasant saw that

1231
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,947
and she saw
how high-end the fixtures were

1232
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,114
and how beautiful it was,

1233
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,985
she wanted Overture Hall
to be beautiful

1234
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:09,223
and to have quality
construction materials in it.

1235
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:11,391
So that came out of that.

1236
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:12,793
We learned that the way

1237
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,629
to have a good acoustic
for a symphony orchestra

1238
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:19,366
is that there's no division
between the stage

1239
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:20,801
and the audience.

1240
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,004
That the stage and the audience
have to be in the same room.

1241
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:28,108
So you don't have a proscenium
arch cutting off that sound.

1242
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:31,144
So when you go to Overture Hall
and we're in concert setting,

1243
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,781
you see that
the cantilevered ceiling

1244
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,584
goes right into the hall.

1245
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:39,720
And so that already is
the secret

1246
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:42,756
to so many of the concert halls
in Europe.

1247
00:53:42,823 --> 00:53:47,027
You know, that is
for a first-rate acoustic.

1248
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:48,529
So we had that.

1249
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:51,965
And there's not a lot
we could do in that hall

1250
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:53,133
'cause it's multi-purpose.

1251
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,468
I mean, we can expose drapes.

1252
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:59,072
We can part drapes to,
we expose drapes mainly

1253
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,874
to absorb sound
when we're rehearsing.

1254
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:02,276
So it's like the audience,

1255
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:04,811
and then we pocket them
when we're actually there.

1256
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,079
So we learned all of that,

1257
00:54:06,146 --> 00:54:08,949
but also, we were
able to look at sight lines.

1258
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:10,984
We were able to look
at all kinds of things.

1259
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:14,254
And, you know, I remember
the first year in the hall,

1260
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:17,291
Rick Mackey,
the brilliant, you know,

1261
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:21,061
predecessor to our
brilliant Robert Reed,

1262
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:24,865
did not sell those
slide box seats the first season

1263
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,868
because he said, "Look,
our public has no experience

1264
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:29,136
"sitting on the side,

1265
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:33,607
and we've got to make sure those
sight lines are okay."

1266
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:34,842
They were.

1267
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,176
You could see the whole stage

1268
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:38,879
or almost the entire stage
sitting on the side.

1269
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:42,816
So those then became,
you know, coveted seats.

1270
00:54:42,883 --> 00:54:44,618
So all of that kind of stuff,
you know,

1271
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:45,819
behind the scenes.

1272
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:47,688
And then, you know,

1273
00:54:47,988 --> 00:54:52,226
so when we went to see
the hall in Charlotte,

1274
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,262
the back of the,
it was a multi-purpose hall,

1275
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:57,431
and it was set up for symphony.

1276
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:00,100
And the back wall had
organ pipes across,

1277
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:02,002
just like ours does.

1278
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,505
And so they had planned
for an organ,

1279
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:07,508
but they had run out of money,
so those pipes were faux.

1280
00:55:07,574 --> 00:55:09,543
[Norman laughs]
But we didn't.

1281
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,979
Pleasant gave us that organ.
- The organ, yes.

1282
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:14,147
- And I really thought,
"Oh, my God,

1283
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:15,549
"if we could just have an organ,

1284
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,518
it'd be so much
like a European concert hall."

1285
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:20,220
Well, Anne Stonkey, who was
running the opera at the time,

1286
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:21,388
dead set against it.

1287
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:23,423
She didn't want
that organ in there.

1288
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,060
- Oh, well...
- Because the wing space,

1289
00:55:28,128 --> 00:55:32,266
while it was gonna be more
than the Oscar Mayer,

1290
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:34,601
it still was not gonna be,

1291
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,403
you know,
if you go to the Kennedy Center,

1292
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,239
you go to stage right,
it's as big as the stage.

1293
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:41,909
So you could put
an entire act off to the side.

1294
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:44,077
The Met has it on both sides.

1295
00:55:44,144 --> 00:55:47,147
I was in Kaohsiung
in Taiwan earlier this year,

1296
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:49,082
and I went to see
the art center there.

1297
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,585
And both sides of the stage
for the opera house

1298
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:53,487
were the size
of the opera house.

1299
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:54,955
So we didn't have that.

1300
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,957
So then, what do you do about,

1301
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:59,726
we have a more sophisticated way
of doing projections now,

1302
00:55:59,793 --> 00:56:01,828
but rear screen projections
at that time

1303
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:03,463
needed to be able to project.

1304
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,399
So you needed some depth
back there,

1305
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:09,102
and the organ was going
to eat up all of that rear space

1306
00:56:09,169 --> 00:56:11,738
where the opera could
store sets, of the organ.

1307
00:56:11,805 --> 00:56:13,740
And I worked for both companies,
right?

1308
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:15,409
So I just turned a blind--
I said,

1309
00:56:15,475 --> 00:56:16,910
"Anne, we need the organ.

1310
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:18,245
We'll figure it out."

1311
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:22,616
And of course, the very first
opera we did, <i>Turandot,</i>

1312
00:56:22,683 --> 00:56:25,052
when that production came
from Chicago Lyric

1313
00:56:25,118 --> 00:56:28,889
and San Francisco,
that was a ginormous production.

1314
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:32,159
And I remember
that everybody was panicked

1315
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:33,527
that the sets weren't
gonna fit.

1316
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:35,929
There was no way we were gonna
get them in Overture Hall.

1317
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:37,164
And how we solved the problem?

1318
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:40,400
We built the sets up
in the loading dock.

1319
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:43,203
We put trusses,
and we stored the scenery

1320
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,806
out in the loading dock
and then just put it right in

1321
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,508
and so we could do anything
we wanted.

1322
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:49,543
But those were the early days.

1323
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,378
I mean, we were afraid.

1324
00:56:51,445 --> 00:56:53,046
And then--
- You learned, though.

1325
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:55,782
- And then the acoustic
for the opera was so good.

1326
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:59,119
That was sort of like
by default, really great.

1327
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:00,921
So we're so fortunate.

1328
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:02,956
- Well, it's been great,
and I feel fortunate

1329
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:05,626
getting behind the scenes
with you, John DeMain.

1330
00:57:05,692 --> 00:57:08,262
- Thank you.
- So many moving parts,

1331
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:10,497
and we've learned
a lot about them.

1332
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:13,634
And always great to hear you
and see you in action.

1333
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,669
- Thank you.
[chuckles]

1334
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:16,837
- I'm Norman Gilliland.

1335
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:18,438
I hope you'll join me
next time around

1336
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:21,508
for <i>University Place Presents.</i>

1337
00:57:23,043 --> 00:57:24,711
