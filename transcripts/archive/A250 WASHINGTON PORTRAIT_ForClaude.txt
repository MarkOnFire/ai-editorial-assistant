1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,266
If you were to dig around in the 
Wisconsin Historical Society's painting

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:06,366
collection, you might just come 
across a familiar face.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,266
George Washington, Founding Father and our nation's 
first president.

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:13,300
You might also notice
that this image of Washington

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,666
looks awfully similar
to the one on our dollar bills.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,033
Is the Wisconsin image
the basis of the dollar bill portrait?

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,566
No, but they are related.

8
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,700
In the 1850s,
the young Wisconsin Historical Society

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,700
was starting to build its art 
collection and offered free memberships

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,866
to artists who provided paintings.

11
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:34,233
Thomas Sully offered to paint
a copy of the Gilbert Stuart portrait

12
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:38,233
of George Washington,
painted from life back in 1796.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,300
It's been copied
countless times in all sorts of media.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,966
And one of those copies has been 
at home in Wisconsin for 
over 170 years now.
