1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:04,337
- There is a long history of
humans using fur for clothing.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,173
Animal skins were probably
some of the earliest garments

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,510
worn by humans tens
of thousands of years ago.

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,096
But by the 1600s and 1700s,

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,099
as the North American fur trade
was really getting started,

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,102
furs in Europe
were more of a luxury item.

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,313
This was in part because
people had hunted many small,

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,942
fur-bearing animals almost to
extinction in parts of Europe.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,571
The result was that furs
had become very expensive.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,990
The high cost of furs
made them a status symbol

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,324
in European fashion.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,160
They were something that
showed off a person's wealth

13
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,287
or their high social standing.

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,080
Fur could be used
to trim a garment

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,332
or processed into something
like a hat.

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,584
- But animal furs and skins

17
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,586
could be about more
than just fashion.

18
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,921
The thick hides of animals
like deer and bison

19
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,465
could be made
into tough leather belts

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,760
that were used in the machines
of the early industrial period.

21
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,720
All this meant that
animal skins and furs

22
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,389
were a highly-sought commodity
by European traders

23
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,099
in North America.
