I'm with Aquatic Plant

00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:25,917
My business offers services
related to lake surveys,

00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,999
specifically
aquatic plant surveys,

aquatic invasive species
monitoring.

12
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,250
To summarize, it would really be
aquatic botany.

either boating,
fishing, swimming.

16
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,333
Anybody who fishes
knows

17
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,875
that aquatic plant beds
are a good place to target

18
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,750
when you're casting

19

and looking for
certain species of fish

20
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,999
because aquatic plants
provide structural habitat

21
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,999
for not only fish,
but what the fish eat.

Structure for those complex

among the native animals
of that area of that lake.

24
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,125
So, I'm usually
the one doing the raking.

00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,583
And then,
my field technician, Andrea,

And we go from sample point
to sample point in a boat.

Once we arrive
at a sample point,

30
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,999
I have a two-sided rake.

31
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,417
And I take
that two-sided rake,

32
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:36,000
lower it down
until it's touching the bottom.

- Sara: Four feet.

34
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,542
And twist that rake
a couple of times,

35
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,999
and we pull it up,
and see what we can find.

00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,417
Sara: We're gonna give that
a one.

Milfoil, one.

I kind of call out

Andrea records the data,

And we do that
at least 200 times in a day.

00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,583
And I try to take that
information to a lake group,

43
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,999
and help them
feel excited about it, too.

44
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,625
By the way, Brandy Lake,

45
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,500
I mean, it's not great
that there's milfoil,

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,083
but it's great that you have
all these surveys.

47
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:14,959
Because most lake groups

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,125
just getting started
with management...

49
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,125
It could very much
just be

50
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,959
a group of people
around a lake

51
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,458
who have a concern.

52
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,999
I think lake groups
just want to know,

53
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,125
"Are we doing
the right thing?

Are we
on the right course?"

So, anytime that your native
plant species can be left,

56
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:34,834
it's one less spot
for invasive species
to colonize.

and the word
that is being used is "weeds,"

60
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:45,792
I will say, how about
we try saying "plants?"

I think just using
the word "plants"

66
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:00,709
makes us think about those
organisms in a different light.

to only do it
for a couple of years.

73
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,959
And I thought, "Well,
I'll try this for a little while

74
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,208
and see
how it goes."

12 years ago.

that my impact is

78
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:37,999
promoting the view of aquatic
plants in a more positive way

79
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,750
and just seeing how much
they benefit us

80
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,625
rather than
how much they're in our way.
