00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,509
- Rachel Barton Pine: I was last
with the La Crosse Symphony

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,844
in October of 2016,
when we collaborated

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:14,581
on the third violin concerto
of Camille Saint-Saens.

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,083
And so it's wonderful
to be back,

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,621
but actually, my collaboration
with Maestro Alexander Platt

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,789
goes much farther back
than that.

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:28,161
We actually collaborated on my
2004 album, <i>Scottish Fantasies,</i>

9
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,631
recorded with the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra,

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,798
all of these wonderful,

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,067
Scottish-flavored,
serious concertos

12
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,569
for violin and orchestra.

13
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,907
And even though I've made dozens
of recordings since then,

14
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,310
it seems to be a perennial
popular favorite

15
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,478
with the public.

16
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,347
And so it's always fun
to reunite with Alexander

17
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,350
because I just love
his musicianship,

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,219
his passion for music.

19
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,688
His dedication and commitment.

20
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,823
It's always wonderful
to work with a musician

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,560
who just loves music so much.

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:05,032
So this violin was made
in the year 1742

23
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,568
by Guarneri del Gesu
of Cremona, Italy.

24
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,636
Guarneri and Stradivari
are considered to be

25
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,638
the two greatest makers ever.

26
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:15,776
And it's really just a matter
of taste, which one you prefer.

27
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,911
I'm very lucky
to be using this one.

28
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,948
It's called the ex-Bazzini,
ex-Soldat

29
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,884
after two of the great artists
who played it in the past,

30
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,052
Antonio Bazzini,

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,122
a early 19th century
Paganini-style virtuoso,

32
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,259
and then Marie Soldat, one
of the women violin soloists

33
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,429
of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries.

34
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,432
So it's amazing to play
Brahms' music on an instrument

35
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,967
that was one
of the first instruments

36
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,969
to ever play
the Brahms Concerto.

37
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,439
And it's just such an honor
to be able to play this violin.

38
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,309
It not only does everything that
I could possibly imagine,

39
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,311
but it even suggests things
to me

40
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,146
that I would've never
thought of.

41
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,415
[gentle violin music]

42
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,452
Often in violin concertos,
there are moments

43
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,921
when the violin is playing
all by itself.

44
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,924
It's a little bit equivalent to
the guitar solo in a rock song,

45
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,793
except that in the case
of cadenzas,

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,229
the instrumentalist
is completely alone,

47
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,265
but they are playing some,
you know,

48
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,269
just fooling around with the
different arpeggios and stuff,

49
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,472
playing derivations of material
that's been heard

50
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,274
in the music heretofore.

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,710
And in the olden days,
in the time of Mozart,

52
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,980
people used to actually
improvise their cadenzas

53
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:31,084
based on, you know, general
rules of how one does that,

54
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,221
but, you know, just kind of
make it up on the spot.

55
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,989
Very few people do that
these days.

56
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,325
I think primarily because
we're playing so many

57
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,562
different styles of music,
even if all we do is classical,

58
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,729
we're playing music from many,

59
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,398
many different centuries
and countries,

60
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:48,902
and so we're not as steeped in
just one narrow musical language

61
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,105
like they were
in the late 1700s.

62
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,275
[bright violin music]

63
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,918
Brahms was really one
of the last concertos

64
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,353
ever written for violin,

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,591
where there was this big pause
with a cadenza opportunity.

66
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,492
And so, of course,

67
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,262
the very first performer of the
concerto, Joseph Joachim,

68
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,698
his dedicatee, wrote a cadenza,

69
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:22,002
and many people will play
Joachim's cadenza.

70
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,004
But there's nothing
more personal

71
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,207
than writing your own cadenza,
because each of us as performers

72
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,377
plays each concerto
slightly differently

73
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,980
based on not only the traditions
of the time

74
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,449
and what we believe to be
the composer's intentions,

75
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:39,253
but also based on our own
individual personality.

76
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,854
Each of us is unique as a human,

77
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,991
and so therefore
only your own cadenza

78
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,494
can be truly integrated
with your own interpretation.

79
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,631
And so, when I was younger,
I used to worry that, gosh,

80
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,833
if I write a cadenza,
it might not be as good

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,435
as the classic ones
by Joachim and Kreisler.

82
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,105
And then I realized I was
looking at it all wrong,

83
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:01,608
that only my cadenza could be
the truest to myself,

84
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,611
and it's not about comparing
mine to anybody else's

85
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,747
'cause only mine
is the most me.

86
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,049
And therefore, I always try
to encourage young artists

87
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,186
to write their own cadenzas,
because it's just such a fun way

88
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,190
to personally express yourself
in music.

[gentle orchestral music]

90
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,229
It's a great way to be creative

91
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:25,666
and also to give something a
little bit fresh to the audience

92
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,000
that they haven't heard before,

93
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:31,705
even if they've heard the
Brahms concerto a million times.

[gentle orchestral music]

95
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,216
I feel so incredibly lucky
to be living my dream, really.

96
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,384
This is the life
I always wanted to have,

97
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,187
being able to play lots
of concerts for people,

98
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,157
and in the concert halls
and beyond.

99
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,893
I have a concert next week
at a homeless shelter,

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,898
and that means just as much as a
big 1,000-seat concert hall.

101
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,534
And being able to uplift
people's spirits with music

102
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,835
is what it's really all about.

103
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,638
And then being able to encourage
the next generation

104
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,773
and explore different
repertoire,

105
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,776
whether it's newly-written
pieces or historic things

106
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:14,548
that have been heretofore
under-recognized.

107
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,651
It's just so exciting to be able
to get to do all that I do.

108
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:22,956
And it's just so amazing that I
get to live my life this way.
