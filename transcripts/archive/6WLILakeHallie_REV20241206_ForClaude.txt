1
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,511
Just thriving and loving it.

2
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,217
It's a quirky house on a quirky

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,420
lake surrounded by quirky people

4
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,659
This is Karen!

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,301
My neighbors,

6
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,502
my best friend, Karen.

7
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,672
We just have this
this bond over Lake Hallie

8
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,240
And so that makes it

9
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,441
a special place.

10
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:45,312
And I realize how blessed
I am to say that.
