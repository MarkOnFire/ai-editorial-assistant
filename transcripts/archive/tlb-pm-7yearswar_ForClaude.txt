00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,502
The Seven Years War was 
an international conflict

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,672
that lasted from 1754 until 1763.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,174
The two primary forces were 
France and Great Britain.

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,343
Although many other nations 
and peoples were involved.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,013
North America, the conflict 
started with disputes

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,807
over land claims in the area 
of the Ohio River Valley.

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,060
When the conflict ended in 1763
with the Treaty of Paris, 

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,479
France was forced to cede 
its lands and Canada,

9
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,606
then New France, to the British.

10
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,860
Now, although Great Britain
expanded its holdings 
in North America,

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,821
a number of factors
related to the Seven Years War

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,490
would ultimately lead
to the American Revolution.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,452
This included American colonists
desire to take lands

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,871
that were supposed to 
be held by Indian nations,

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,290
and the new taxes that 
were imposed on colonists

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,500
as a way to pay off 
Britain's national debt.
