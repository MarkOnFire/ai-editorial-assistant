00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,417
- Next, we head
to Green Bay,

162
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,166
where a group
of runners

163
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,750
are taking
to the trails

164
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,792
for more
than just a workout.

165
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,375
[gentle, serious
instrumental]

166
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,667
Angela: Ever felt
the need for a break?

167
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:23,625
- Miss Smedemac: It's quiet.

168
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,999
There's nobody here.
[feet tapping forest floor]

169
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:30,999
I can just be out here
by myself in nature.

170
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,417
- A chance to step away.

171
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,999
- Relena Ribbons:
There's something about
connecting with the earth

172
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,999
as I'm running over it
that's pretty joyful.

173
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,166
- Regain your footing.

174
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,125
- Tommy Byrne: You feel free.

175
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,792
You feel relaxed.

176
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,999
You feel disconnected from,
I would say,

177
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,834
the busyness
of just all the things

178
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,875
in front of you
every day.

179
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,000
- And realize
that some things in life

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,625
are just much bigger
than we initially thought.

181
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,875
- Tommy Byrne: I think we live
in a culture where it's,

182
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,250
"Pull up your bootstraps,

183
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,999
"and just get it done.

184
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,917
And life's hard."

185
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,709
And that whole narrative
of "Be tough,"

186
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,417
and "The grittier,
the more you go through,

187
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,625
the stronger you are."

188
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,750
And I think it's a lie.
[chuckles]

189
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,458
I think the strong people are
the ones that are asking help

190
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,792
and the friends
that are standing by them

191
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,500
to give that help

192
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,250
or to point them
in the right direction.

193
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,166
- Tommy Byrne
knows what it means

194
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,583
to deal with issues
surrounding mental health.

195
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,875
It's a hard trail
to navigate,

196
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,500
especially when the person

197
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,291
whose footsteps
we're told to follow

198
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,750
are lost themselves.

199
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,999
- Tommy: I lost a father
to suicide when I was 18,

200
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:46,875
and I compared my own
mental health journey to his

201
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,667
for the longest time, where

202
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:53,291
"I wasn't<i>that</i>bad,"
is what I would always say.

203
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:57,041
And I realized
I was white-knuckling it

204
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,999
through a lot of situations
when I didn't need to be.

205
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,542
And I remember vividly

206
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,000
finally reaching
a breaking point

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,583
where I knew
I needed support,

208
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,875
and I knew I needed
to ask for help,

209
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,667
and I was scared.

210
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,999
- Tommy helped create
Bigger Than The Trail,

211
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,917
an organization
that uses trail running

212
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:24,166
as a platform
to advocate for mental health.

213
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,542
- Tommy: Bigger Than The Trail

214
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,999
came because
my own mental health journey

215
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,917
and my passion
for trail running.

216
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,917
So, around the time
that I found trail running,

217
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,999
I took my own
mental health serious

218
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:40,291
and got diagnosed
with bipolar

219
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,917
and just, I really had
a support system in my life

220
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,959
with people, and family,
and friends.

221
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,999
And I knew that some people
didn't have that in their life.

222
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:54,458
And I wanted to find a way to
make sure people felt supported.

223
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,750
- Through running,
the group has helped

224
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,291
over 500 people
across the country

225
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,166
with issues
concerning mental health.

226
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,125
The goal is not to act
as a substitute for therapy

227
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,834
or medical attention,

228
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,750
but to serve
as a stepping point

229
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,750
to get
the help needed.

230
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,166
- Tommy:
What we really advocate for
for Bigger Than The Trail is,

231
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,999
as positive
as running is,

232
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:21,834
we want to
also build community

233
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,250
and give people
access to professional support

234
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,999
so that if running
was ever taken away from them,

235
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,291
whether injury,
or age, or anything,

236
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,333
they have tools
in their toolbox

237
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,959
to continue to have

238
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,999
healthy mental health
dialogue and conversations.

239
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:42,792
- It's by building community
that Bigger Than The Trail

240
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,999
has created
the most strides.

241
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,709
- Miss Smedemac:
Being able to see the things
that you struggle with

242
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,250
in someone else

243
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,333
and seeing, not only
do they also struggle with it,

244
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,875
but they also succeed.

245
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,333
And looking at someone else
and saying,

246
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,208
"Hey, you struggle with
the same things that I do,

247
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,291
"and you're out there,

248
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,458
"just running
an awesome life,

249
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,000
"you're running your world,

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,125
"and I can do that, too,"

251
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,834
and knowing
that they're going to be there

252
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,333
to support you and have
your back is incredible.

253
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,625
[stream babbles briskly]

254
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,792
- Angela: To determine success,

255
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,333
you could point to the 1,500
months of free counseling

256
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,333
the group
has provided people.

257
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,959
An incredible feat.

258
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,999
But it's probably not
the best way

259
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,500
to measure their impact.

260
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,999
The best way
is by asking this question:

261
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,959
"What does Tommy Byrne
mean to you?"

262
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,333
- Relena Ribbons:
Tommy changed my life.

263
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,583
I don't know that
I tell him that enough.

264
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,709
But I had some
other traumatic life,

265
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,542
like severe losses
and real grief.

266
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,834
And Tommy's
one of the few people

267
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:46,458
who made me feel

268
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,500
like it's going to be okay
eventually.

269
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,999
Being able to know
that I could

270
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,000
reach out
to folks and say,

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,959
"Hey, I'm having a really
hard time sleeping tonight.

272
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,166
"These things have happened

273
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,917
and had cascading
negative effects on my life."

274
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,333
But they really helped me
to see

275
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,500
that it's not
going to be forever.

276
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,041
- Miss Smedemac:
Tommy means a lot to me.

277
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,667
Tommy is a guy who
I can reach out to any time

278
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,041
and say, "Hey, I need a hand.

279
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,166
"I just need somebody
to cheerlead me.

280
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,999
I need somebody
to hear me."

281
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,291
He's the guy
I could reach out to

282
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,333
and say, "Hey, I'm really
anxious about this,

283
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,917
"and I just need somebody
to hype me up

284
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,417
and tell me
it's going to be okay."

285
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,041
We don't have to have
this super connection

286
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,750
to know that I can
always reach out to him.

287
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,667
- Tommy: I'm not a person
that wants it to be about me,

288
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,375
but it's an important topic,

289
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:41,333
and I think that as unique
as I wish my story was,

290
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,875
all of these people have been
affected by mental health,

291
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,542
whether it be their selves
or through family or friends,

292
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:51,375
and I think
<i>that</i>is why this is important

293
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:51,999
and why it matters

294
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:56,959
and why it's worth continuing
to fight and put the work in.

295
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,208
So, it does feel good,

296
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,458
but it's more about
the big picture

297
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,999
than how I feel.

298
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,750
- Angela: There are several
different trails in life;

299
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,083
some dark,
some are narrow,

300
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,999
and some so overgrown
we can barely tell

301
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,834
what direction
they're leading us.

302
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:19,291
[feet landing softly]

303
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,834
It's through others

304
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,750
we can start
to find our bearings.

305
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,333
Light seeps in,

306
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,083
the path widens,

307
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,625
things thin out.

308
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,542
And we slowly
become much bigger

309
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,583
than the trail
we're running on.

310
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,834
- Tommy: No matter
what you're facing,

311
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:37,959
you're bigger
than that.

312
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,333
You're more than
your diagnosis.

313
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,458
You're more than

314
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,208
the endurance sport
or race

315
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,917
that you have
in front of you.

316
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,583
You're bigger than

of kind of more
educational programming,

is our
Homeschool Science program.

up into the sugar bush
in that park

344

the sugar maple trees.
