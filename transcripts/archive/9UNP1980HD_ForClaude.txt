[gentle music]

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,238
- Nete Schmidt: Thank you
so much to everyone

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,572
for showing up tonight.

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,508
It's really nice to see faces,

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,477
and I hope we're gonna have
a nice hour together.

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,680
Thank you so much to Rachael
for inviting me.

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,682
It's always fun to go out
and talk about something

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,917
that you're interested in

9
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,520
and that you hope others
will also be interested in.

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,522
And that's what
I'm going to do tonight.

11
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:26,360
So, I put down for the title
"Nordic, Scandinavian Noir."

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,464
And that's because it actually
kind of started out with Nordic.

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,234
And my name is Nee-ta Shmit,
in Danish, Nay-te Smit.

14
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,204
Kind of the same, but easier
to say Nee-ta Shmit.

15
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:41,608
And I have been
a proud member of the UW-Madison

16
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,846
for many, many years,
since 1998.

17
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,483
And, of course,
I am in the Nordic unit

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,285
in German, Nordic, and Slavic,

19
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,688
a merged department
at UW-Madison.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,593
So, my first question to you is,
as good students,

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,230
what are
the Scandinavian countries?

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,599
- Attendee 1: Sweden.

23
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,767
- Nete: Sweden.

24
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,101
- Attendee 2: Finland, Denmark.

25
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,503
- Nete: Denmark.
- Attendee 2: Norway.

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,939
- Nete: Norway, good job.

27
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,674
Denmark, Norway, Sweden.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,977
And what are the
Nordic countries?

29
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,715
Ooh!

30
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,016
Silence.

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,451
Somebody said Finland.

32
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,186
Yes, please.

33
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,455
What else do we have up there,

34
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,591
in, you know, the dark
and the cold?

35
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,792
- Attendee 1: Greenland?
- Yes.

36
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,460
- Attendee 1: Iceland.
- Nete: And Iceland.

37
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,063
And one more
that you didn't think about.

38
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,931
The Faroe Islands.

39
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,235
So, Scandinavia, the three.

40
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,671
And then this is where they are.

41
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,776
And you can see that Greenland
is a part of Denmark.

42
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:54,781
It's in a kind of community,
like a commonwealth,

43
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,949
with Denmark.

44
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,851
It has independence.

45
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,520
We have Iceland.

46
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,090
That also used to be a part
of Denmark, up 'til 1944,

47
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,125
when they declared independence.

48
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,729
Then, out in the middle,
we have the Faroe Islands.

49
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,133
And it's a tiny, little island
group, very rocky, very,

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,202
I mean, all these countries
are worth visiting.

51
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,071
So I can definitely
kind of encourage you

52
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,474
to go there
and see for yourself.

53
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,376
Faroe Islands
are a part of Denmark,

54
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,278
and both the Faroe Islands
and Greenland

55
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,482
have members and representation
in the Danish parliament.

56
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,286
Then we have, as you can see,
Iceland down there,

57
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,453
Faroe Islands.

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,888
Then we go on to Norway.

59
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,156
And it won't surprise you

60
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,859
to hear that Norway
was part of Denmark

61
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,361
in the Kalmar Union
for many, many years,

62
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,096
from 1397 to 1815.

63
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:49,203
And Sweden was also a part
of this Kalmar Union.

64
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,271
And I want to mention it

65
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,342
because it was actually created
by a woman.

66
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,713
If you can imagine,
back in 1397,

67
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,250
the first Queen Margaret
of Denmark.

68
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,420
She created this union.

69
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,456
And it lasted 'til 1815
with Norway.

70
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,593
Sweden kind of stepped out
in 1526.

71
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,127
They were not as interested.

72
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,597
And, then, finally,
we have tiny, little Denmark,

73
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,831
as you can see.

74
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,800
That's where I'm from.

75
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,537
I put Aarhus,
the second-largest city.

76
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,206
That's my native town.

77
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,776
And it's about, well,
a little bit bigger

78
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:34,181
than Madison, about 350,000,
375,000 people.

79
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,950
And still the second-largest.

80
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,785
And the largest, of course,
is Copenhagen.

81
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,522
So if you find me
to be a little prejudiced

82
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,791
in my talk about Denmark,
then that's why.

83
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,728
I was born there and lived there
for many, many years.

84
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,864
And then I married my wonderful
American husband,

85
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,700
and then we started traveling
a lot back and forth.

86
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:58,105
And in 1998, we decided
that it was worth a shot.

87
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,808
And I got the job in Madison
and we moved over here,

88
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,210
and the rest is history.

89
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,245
And we just kind of stayed.

90
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,880
And we have five kids,

91
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,716
and two of them
are still in Denmark,

92
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,685
and three in the U.S.

93
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,290
So that's kind of
my background story.

94
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,493
And I've taught
at various institutions.

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,195
The University of Aarhus

96
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,064
and junior colleges
in various places,

97
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,900
also in the U.S.,
in Massachusetts.

98
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,237
But definitely
University of Wisconsin-Madison

99
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,439
is my home, so to speak.

100
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,575
This is what you're looking at.

101
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,376
And what are we going
to be doing today?

102
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:41,481
Well, we're going to be talking
about a lot of the background

103
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,352
for why Nordic noir
became a phenomenon,

104
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,654
primarily in 2005,

105
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,693
when Stieg Larsson's,
the book in Swedish,

106
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,595
<i>The Girl</i>
<i>with the Dragon Tattoo,</i>

107
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,831
or the Swedish title,
<i>Men Who Hate Women,</i>

108
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,167
when that hit the scene.

109
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,437
Because that was a revival
of this phenomenon

110
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,374
called Nordic noir,
or Scandinavian noir.

111
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,009
But we're also going
to be talking

112
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,478
about the whys and wherefores.

113
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:16,116
Why from these countries
did we have this phenomenon

114
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,685
of murder mysteries and so on?

115
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,355
In other words, you can start
by asking yourselves,

116
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,892
"Well, are they crime-ridden
countries?"

117
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,629
No, and that's what I'd like
to go through with you,

118
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,765
a little bit of the background,
the cultural background,

119
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:36,236
and also, the background
for crime stories per se.

120
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,971
A little bit about police,

121
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,975
and then moving
into the phenomenon itself.

122
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,544
And I want to share with you

123
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,312
some of the authors
that I really like,

124
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,347
some that I don't really like,

125
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,018
and try to give you an idea
of where you may go

126
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,989
if you want to, you know,
just pursue reading these books.

127
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:59,326
And like they said, if you have
really pressing questions,

128
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,128
just jump in there with them.

129
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,530
But otherwise,
please keep them 'til the end

130
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,933
because I can always repeat
questions.

131
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:12,139
So, my first question was crime
in these Scandinavian countries.

132
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,577
So, I've been doing a lot of
searching here for statistics.

133
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,046
And as you can see
at the bottom line,

134
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,381
that was the latest I could get.

135
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,116
No, not really.

136
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,721
Homicide in Scandinavia
compared to the U.S.

137
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,456
is very minimal.

138
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,694
I chose here Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and Sweden.

139
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,729
Those were the easiest to find.

140
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,998
But I can still remember

141
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,435
when a homicide happened
in Iceland

142
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,205
and the president called
the family of the bereaved

143
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,375
to give her
personal condolences.

144
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,644
And you're thinking, "Oh, okay.

145
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,481
"So it's not something
that happens every day.

146
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:59,786
It is something that makes the
headlines of the newspapers."

147
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,990
The next one is the
Global Peace Index.

148
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,526
I don't know if you know
this figure,

149
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,829
but it was created
many, many years ago.

150
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:13,233
And it covers various parameters
that you can use

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,437
to measure how peaceful
a country is inside,

152
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,240
domestic violence, et cetera,

153
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,443
and outside
towards its neighbors.

154
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,180
And it's actually, I mean,
recognized

155
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:30,050
as this statistic tool
to discuss peace.

156
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,456
And as you can see,
Iceland is a proud number one.

157
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,927
Then we move down,
and Denmark is number eight,

158
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,797
Finland number 13, Norway 28,
Sweden 39.

159
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,701
And the United States
a proud 132.

160
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:53,006
I thought I should show you
the one that's last on the list,

161
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,311
which is Yemen,
Sudan number next to the last.

162
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,015
So the Scandinavian countries
do not have very many homicides.

163
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,517
They're very peaceful countries.

164
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,486
And again, I want you
to keep at the back of your mind

165
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,656
why, then,
do they write these stories

166
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,060
that have gained renown
worldwide?

167
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,929
Incarceration rates.

168
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,031
Do we put people in jail?

169
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,466
Yes.

170
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,569
But if you look at it,
and you can see Iceland,

171
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,874
which has about 393,000 people
all together.

172
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,144
Well, 37 per 100,000.

173
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,249
Finland has 5.62 million.

174
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,518
And these are the latest,
again, the latest figures

175
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,819
I could find.

176
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,988
51 people per 100,000.

177
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,625
Norway, 57,
a country of 5.59 million.

178
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,260
And then you look at Denmark,

179
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,829
and it's so similar
to Wisconsin.

180
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,966
I hope you know that Wisconsin
has 5.9 million inhabitants.

181
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,902
Well, so does Denmark.

182
00:08:54,968 --> 00:09:00,107
So, we have 72 incarcerated
per 100,000, and Sweden 74.

183
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,945
The reason for this
is that the philosophy

184
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,247
behind putting people in jail

185
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,650
is that they need
to be resocialized,

186
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:15,155
they need to be reentered
into society as full members,

187
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,959
and we need to get them out
as soon as possible.

188
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,296
If you are sentenced
to a life sentence,

189
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,032
in Denmark, it is 16 years.

190
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:29,102
And that would be in case
of homicide, murder,

191
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,072
something that is preplanned.

192
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,775
That would be 16 years in jail.

193
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,779
And you'd get out after 12
with good behavior.

194
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:43,116
So as you can see, the emphasis
is on socializing people,

195
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,520
getting them back into society,
getting them to function.

196
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,989
And that's why
these incarceration rates

197
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:52,960
are so tiny
compared to other countries.

198
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,162
As you can see,
not to all countries.

199
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,065
Japan is doing very well
in this respect.

200
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,168
Switzerland, Austria, Canada,
the U.K., Russia,

201
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,070
and then the United States.

202
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:07,074
Once again, you can say that we
are filled with records here,

203
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,809
531 per 100,000.

204
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:15,349
And right now, it's Mississippi
and Wisconsin that are-- oh.

205
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,317
I put MI, isn't that Michigan?

206
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, ah, that is a huge mistake.

207
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,524
I'm sorry, it's Mississippi
and Wisconsin.

208
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,927
So here are just, you know,
food for thought, right?

209
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,263
What is going on
in these countries?

210
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,864
Are they poor?

211
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,933
No, they are not poor.

212
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,335
There's another way
of comparing.

213
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,604
You can do the GDP and PPP.

214
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,207
And I'm not very good at this.

215
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,009
So, I've been reading up on it,

216
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,977
and the way
you can think about it,

217
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,380
which was, you know,
making sense to me,

218
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,716
is that the PPP is kind of like
a basket of goods.

219
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,986
How much does it cost
in any given country

220
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,056
if you have the same kind
of currency

221
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,724
and you say it's a dollar?

222
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,694
So that's where you can see
that Norway, Denmark,

223
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,532
Iceland, Sweden, Finland
are pretty well-to-do countries

224
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,502
and actually better
than the United States.

225
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,205
When it comes to Norway,
that's the richest country.

226
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,840
And do you know why?

227
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,274
Oil.

228
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,144
They found oil
out in the North Sea,

229
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,314
and they actually have
a pension fund

230
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,349
for all Norwegians

231
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,553
so that the state has put money
from the oil finds aside

232
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,256
for all the members
of the society.

233
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:31,925
So you have money from the oil,

234
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,294
and it's being shared
with everybody.

235
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,797
So, again,
a different kind of mentality,

236
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,867
a different kind of background.

237
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,536
You should also
take into consideration

238
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,972
that tax rates are high.

239
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,042
In Denmark,
you pay about 40%, 45% in taxes.

240
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:54,014
But wages are also
twice as high as here.

241
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:58,552
And you don't have to tip
when you go to restaurants,

242
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,488
because they actually get
very decent wages.

243
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,359
So there's a different attitude
to going out and tipping.

244
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,394
That's something
that you have to get used to

245
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,930
when you move here from one
of the Scandinavian countries.

246
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,498
Oh, gosh.

247
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,166
And my daughter,
who worked as a bartender,

248
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,803
she said, "20%, Mom,
no less than 20%."

249
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,805
So I said, "Okay, okay."

250
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,774
So that's when I learned.

251
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:25,345
But as you can see, they have
good purchasing power,

252
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,081
and they are doing very well.

253
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,119
So, let's move
into a different aspect.

254
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:35,455
This was just figures for you
to think about, okay?

255
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,991
These countries
are well-functioning.

256
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,528
So, what happened
to start this trend

257
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,332
of "Let's have crime stories.

258
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,034
Let's have them written down?"

259
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,669
Well, as you can imagine,

260
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,471
in order to do that,
you have to have two elements.

261
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,607
You have to have some criminals,

262
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:56,810
and you have to have
somebody chasing those criminals

263
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,779
for some reason or other.

264
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:03,750
And it started in France
with the Connétable in 1337.

265
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:10,123
And they were actually trying
to keep highwaymen off the roads

266
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,826
so you could travel around
peacefully.

267
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,330
So that's how the police force
started around the world.

268
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,998
This is interesting.

269
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,868
In 1626, the Maréchaussée,

270
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,736
they were protecting
the road still

271
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,972
and trying to do better
and better.

272
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,574
And finally,
if you look in 1791,

273
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,578
you have the gendarme,
which means "people with arms."

274
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,514
And that's the Gendarmerie.

275
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,350
And the gendarmes
that we have today,

276
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,151
mounted military police force

277
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:42,689
right before the
French Revolution, 3,660 men.

278
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,693
So we did have police,
but in France.

279
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,665
What about, well, <i>Les Misérables</i>
ringing any bells?

280
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:53,834
Yes.

281
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,536
And you know that

282
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,305
there is Jean Valjean,
who's the good guy,

283
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:02,042
and then there's Javert,
who's the bad guy.

284
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,679
And this man,
Eugéne Francois Vidocq,

285
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,383
he was both.

286
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,319
He started out a criminal.

287
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,788
And then at some point,
he thought, "No.

288
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,957
I'm gonna be a police officer
instead,"

289
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,259
and changed his destiny.

290
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:23,030
And he is the model
for Victor Hugo's both,

291
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,432
you know, both of those
characters, Jean Valjean

292
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,368
and Javert
in <i>Les Misérables.</i>

293
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,571
And so,
he published his memoirs.

294
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,738
He didn't
write them himself.

295
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,307
He had a ghostwriter.

296
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,775
But the famous sentence,

297
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:38,045
a lot of it was totally made up,
you know,

298
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,746
just total fiction.

299
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,683
"I am Vidocq, and I arrest you."

300
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,318
So that's how
he became famous.

301
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,754
You know, some detectives
always have that, "Mm!

302
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,290
Now, what is my line here?"

303
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:56,463
Edgar Allan Poe,
I'm sure you know him as well.

304
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,567
And he started
what can even today be called

305
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,303
the modern detective story.

306
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,040
I don't know if you ever read
his first story,

307
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,909
"Murders in the Rue Morgue."

308
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,044
Oh, I can so recommended it.

309
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,414
It is so different from anything
you would read today.

310
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,550
The first two pages
are about the difference

311
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:19,186
between playing chess
and checkers.

312
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,921
And you get completely lost,
and you think,

313
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,823
"Is there a story here?"

314
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,192
And that's just
his philosophizing

315
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,428
about how, you know,
you create a crime

316
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,197
and what the motives can be.

317
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:31,365
So it's fascinating.

318
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,166
And then you move into a story

319
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,603
that is completely different
from anything you've ever read.

320
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,007
And he introduced
C. Auguste Dupin,

321
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,279
the first brilliant detective.

322
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,948
In the first three stories,

323
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,850
I just took
"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt,"

324
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,419
and then "The Purloined Letter"
is the third one.

325
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,389
But he was the one who showed us

326
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,926
that when everything else
doesn't make sense,

327
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,929
you just have to use
your reason.

328
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,798
Then you will find the answer.

329
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,369
So pretty way ahead
of his time with that.

330
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,872
And he was,
I mean, he's a brilliant writer.

331
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,740
You all know "The Raven."

332
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,043
Isn't that still read
in high school or,

333
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,778
I'm sure you could all

334
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,914
probably recite a few stanzas
of that.

335
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,851
And his horror stories as well.

336
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:27,054
But I love
his detective stories.

337
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,258
Then, from that, we moved on to
something a little bit lighter.

338
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,793
They were called yellowbacks,

339
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,562
because they were kind of
disposable books.

340
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,664
They were very cheaply printed.

341
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,066
They had a yellow cover,

342
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:42,769
and they were basically meant
to be thrown away afterwards.

343
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:47,374
But as you can see, the
yellowbacks also comprised

344
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,543
Wilkie Collins'
<i>The Woman in White</i> ,

345
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,380
really a good read still,
and <i>The Moonstone.</i>

346
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,215
I like Wilkie Collins.

347
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:58,051
<i>Les Misérables</i> ,
that I'm sure you all know.

348
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,087
And if you haven't read it,
but just seen the,

349
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:04,658
seen the theater play or the
musical or the movie, it's fine.

350
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,260
But it's a great story.

351
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,795
And of course, Charles Dickens
also jumped on the wagon

352
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,731
with <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood.</i>

353
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:14,735
So these were light,
lightweight detective stories.

354
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,571
They were considered lightweight
at the time.

355
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:23,177
But at the same time, we see
the emergence of police force,

356
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:27,080
first in London,
and then Boston was second.

357
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,516
After that, the New York City.

358
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,120
And we have detectives
a little bit later.

359
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:36,223
And the CID,
you have Charles Vincent.

360
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,457
I love that picture.

361
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,759
But I love this one,

362
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,295
the Criminal Investigations
Department

363
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,997
and the caption to that picture,

364
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,434
"CID officers cunningly
disguised as dockers

365
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,770
"during an investigation
into drug smugglers

366
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,071
at Limehouse Docks."

367
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,674
And I just love that,
so I had to share that with you.

368
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,543
Okay, then you see them
in their normal clothing

369
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,011
on the other picture.

370
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,948
Okay, so here they're
very cunningly disguised.

371
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,685
So Criminal Investigations,
they're your detectives.

372
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,820
We're getting closer to that.

373
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,223
And from Edgar Allan Poe,

374
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:14,461
the next great person
that you all know, I know,

375
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,763
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

376
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,300
Actually,
he's always called Conan Doyle,

377
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,135
but Conan is part
of his first name.

378
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,537
So there's a little bit
of discussion

379
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,205
about where that came from.

380
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,940
Sherlock Holmes.

381
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,309
If you haven't read
any Sherlock Holmes,

382
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,478
you've probably seen
Benedict Cumberbatch

383
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:35,115
as Sherlock Holmes,
or others portraying it.

384
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,351
Basil Rathbone was the first.

385
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,519
One of my favorites,

386
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,788
<i>The Hound of the Baskervilles,</i>
from 1902.

387
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:45,792
And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
was an amazing man.

388
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,195
He made the pattern
for the great detective.

389
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,730
Very arrogant, as you can see,

390
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,766
omniscient,
self-absorbed drug addict.

391
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,503
But also a wonderful person,
of course,

392
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:02,976
when it comes to reasoning
and solving crimes and puzzles

393
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,946
that nobody else can solve.

394
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,848
So Arthur Conan Doyle

395
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:10,050
was absolutely amazing
in this respect.

396
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:14,121
He was also much more
than Sherlock Holmes.

397
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:19,359
And the funniest thing of it all
about Arthur Conan Doyle

398
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:22,996
is the anecdote
that he's actually a doctor.

399
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:26,600
He's a doctor who turned
into an ophthalmologist,

400
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,869
started a practice as a doctor.

401
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:30,637
No patients.

402
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,039
No money.

403
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,942
"Oh, let me write
another Sherlock Holmes story."

404
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,376
Ophthalmologist.

405
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,245
No patients.

406
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,680
No money.

407
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,716
"Let me write
some more Sherlock Holmes."

408
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:46,987
So if he hadn't been
a doctor without patients,

409
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:49,523
we probably wouldn't have had
Sherlock Holmes.

410
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,026
So he's a fascinating
character to read about.

411
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,696
History, women.
Where are the women?

412
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,598
Well, women
were also incarcerated.

413
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,234
So finally, they started saying,

414
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,835
"Well, maybe
it shouldn't be the men

415
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:04,571
"taking care of these prisoners
that are female.

416
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,806
It should be women."

417
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,575
So we had women introduced
into the police force.

418
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:11,879
They were usually described,
which is interesting,

419
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:14,014
"stout Irish women."

420
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:18,118
So that's, I think, what the
first policewoman in England

421
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:21,188
is supposed to look like,
a stout Irish woman.

422
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,057
Those short stories
that had been so popular,

423
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,059
the yellowbacks,
they were declining.

424
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:30,397
And instead, we got
Agatha Christie in 1920.

425
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:33,233
Of course, we also had
the Roaring '20s

426
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,736
and the World War,
first the First,

427
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,371
and then prohibition of alcohol.

428
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,206
So a little bit of history
in there

429
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:42,776
that also was an inspiration
for the writers.

430
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,512
And we come to the Golden Age.

431
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:50,417
That was primarily British,
as you can see,

432
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,886
Agatha Christie
and Dorothy Sayers.

433
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:56,957
Wonderful, wonderful people
and great writers.

434
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,660
Agatha Christie had
the most amazing life.

435
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:00,928
If you read her biography,

436
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,931
you will be just fascinated
by what she did.

437
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:09,236
And she still has <i>The Mousetrap</i>
running, her famous play

438
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:15,142
where you cannot say
who did it to anybody.

439
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,711
We've seen it,
my husband and I,

440
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,215
and they had huge signs
when you exited,

441
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,483
"Please don't share the secret.

442
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,420
Don't ruin the play
for anybody else."

443
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:31,258
Agatha Christie also did
a little different approach

444
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:34,027
to the detective, the classical
detective story, right?

445
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:37,197
But now we have clues,
puzzles, timetables,

446
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:40,868
and we have a great detective
with reason and deduction,

447
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,003
rules, the bourgeoisie.

448
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,440
You can all imagine those
British mansions, right?

449
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:50,844
And then all the suspects
gathered in one room,

450
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,549
and then the detective
facing them and saying,

451
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:57,951
"I know which one did it."

452
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,588
I mean, there's your story,
right?

453
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,224
Hercule Poirot, the Belgian,

454
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,394
and Miss Marple
were her most famous ones.

455
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:08,896
Dorothy Sayers actually

456
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:11,331
didn't really want to write
crime stories either,

457
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,500
but did it just for fun.

458
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,470
She taught herself old Italian

459
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,774
and translated the works
of Dante.

460
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,510
That was what she really
wanted to spend her time doing.

461
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:27,814
But in between, she could throw
out a few Peter Wimsey books.

462
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:31,251
So she was an amazing,
an amazing writer.

463
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,888
Georges Simenon,
another Agatha Christie, and--

464
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:37,157
Oh, sorry,
not another Agatha Christie.

465
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:38,725
Georges Simenon,
the French writer,

466
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:42,529
who at the same time
invented Inspector Maigret.

467
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:45,666
So those were the three
big ones in the Golden Age.

468
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:46,834
British.

469
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,235
What did we have in the U.S.?

470
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,070
Hard-boiled, of course.

471
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,972
And it has to be
Humphrey Bogart,

472
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,373
you can imagine.

473
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,710
Who else would you say is the
hard-boiled crime fiction?

474
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,546
Hammett, Dashiell Hammett,
and Raymond Chandler.

475
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:01,148
Dashiell Hammett with Sam Spade,

476
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,183
Raymond Chandler
with Philip Marlowe.

477
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,785
And a pulp magazine,

478
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:07,721
which means it was really cheap,
very cheap paper.

479
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:11,658
But they started
the dark side of society.

480
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,661
As I said, the criticism
of the U.S. at the time.

481
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:18,665
We are, as you can see,
in the late '20s into the '30s,

482
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,769
and all of a sudden,
we got a much darker approach.

483
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:27,641
Not that cozy English
kind of mansion sensation of,

484
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,944
"Ooh, we're all a little bit
upper class.

485
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,113
And now somebody did
something horrible."

486
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:38,785
Here, we have really dark
and very rainy books sometimes.

487
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,754
You feel almost wet
when you're reading them

488
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:43,156
because it's raining
all the time, and you think,

489
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:44,458
"What are they doing?"

490
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:47,261
Well, they're solving
serious crimes.

491
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:49,696
So the omniscient
and arrogant detective,

492
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:50,864
he was out of there.

493
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,833
And we had darkness.

494
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,304
And the darkness leads me
to police force.

495
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,742
We have a police force that's
very strong in the U.S.,

496
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,778
and I usually tell my students

497
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:08,615
that I go to Denmark for about
three months in the summer.

498
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:11,151
I see maybe three police cars,

499
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,820
if I'm lucky, you know.
[gasps]

500
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,988
"Larry, did you see that?

501
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,156
There was a police car!"

502
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,824
It's kind of something you mark.

503
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,993
You know, a notch in your belt.

504
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,696
You know what it's like
in Madison.

505
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:24,131
You're outside for ten minutes,

506
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:27,000
and there's your first
police car of the day, right?

507
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,436
So it's a very,
very different situation.

508
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:33,073
So I thought you should
also hear about police forces

509
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,010
in our three
Scandinavian countries.

510
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:40,247
It started in 1241,

511
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,182
in Denmark
with the law of Jutland,

512
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,985
where the king was the police.

513
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:48,822
Denmark is the longest-standing
constitutional monarchy

514
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,057
in the world.

515
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:51,992
Constitutional monarchy.

516
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,596
And then, they got ordinances,
and then criminal police,

517
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,431
and then state police.

518
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,666
And you could say
there's so much.

519
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,435
There was a new...

520
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:06,640
They were calling it some kind
of improvement in 2007.

521
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,675
It hasn't proven
to be an improvement

522
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:12,246
because they wanted more police
on the street like here,

523
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,114
and they just haven't had
the money.

524
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:17,351
But as you can see,
they have batons, they have gas,

525
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:20,854
they have pepper spray,
they also have weapons.

526
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,323
And there have been
a few incidents

527
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,093
of what they call terror
in Denmark.

528
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,296
So the police is armed
as needs be.

529
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:34,401
In Norway, they were armed
from 2014 to 2017

530
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:38,672
because of terror actions,
but otherwise they're not armed.

531
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,409
And it's the same,
goes back to 1300.

532
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:46,446
They started finding the need
for somebody to keep the peace.

533
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,650
And as you can see again,
police reform,

534
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,918
Police Directorate,

535
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:54,855
and the organization
in all three countries

536
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,290
is run by the state,

537
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:59,793
and the police in Sweden
is always armed.

538
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,865
So they have probably
the highest incidence of crimes

539
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,601
and feel the need to be armed.

540
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,737
But they also started back
in the Middle Ages.

541
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:13,507
So police forces
are nothing new,

542
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,777
and near police reform
in Denmark,

543
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:18,745
that definitely
was a police reform.

544
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:21,748
So just a little bit
about police forces.

545
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:24,718
Very, very different from the
American police force

546
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,554
in these three Scandinavian
countries.

547
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:28,856
The spy novel.

548
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,457
Well, you heard about that.

549
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,459
And I'm sure you've seen
movies, too.

550
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:36,597
And these are undoubtedly
very well-known names to you,

551
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,498
Ian Fleming,
did you know that he started

552
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:41,034
back with James Bond in 1953?

553
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,638
It's amazing he's still alive
in so many variants.

554
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:48,141
And the British tradition
was much more cozy,

555
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,778
the cozy,
still literary crime novel,

556
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:56,283
a little bit more highbrow
than the American one.

557
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,652
And here are some of the names.

558
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:02,389
The American tradition
was more hard-boiled.

559
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,691
Some of these you may know.

560
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:08,061
There are, of course,
a million to choose from.

561
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,998
But I have to get
to Scandinavia,

562
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,100
and we are now coming
to two Swedes,

563
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,869
Maj Sjöwall
and Per Wahlöö.

564
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:19,540
This is the beginning
of what you could call

565
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:21,508
Scandinavian noir.

566
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,745
And they did it in the '60s
and the '70s.

567
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,447
So it started a long time ago.

568
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:30,517
They wrote police procedurals.

569
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,320
And what is a police procedural?

570
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:36,690
Well, it's a book
where everything is explained

571
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:39,193
and you turn the page and you
want something to happen,

572
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:42,296
and it takes a long time
and a lot of patience

573
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,832
because you go through step
by step by step,

574
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,136
and at the end,
you get the culprit.

575
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:53,040
So it is slow going
from time to time.

576
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,276
But they were
very political writers.

577
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,078
They sat down and said,

578
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:02,282
"We are going to write
a series about a crime,

579
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,887
"and the crime is the way

580
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:11,625
the Swedish society
was treating its citizens."

581
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,260
They were very left wing.

582
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,828
And when I say
"very left wing,"

583
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:17,497
you can't even conceive of it
in the U.S.

584
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:20,234
It's, like, really left wing.

585
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,270
And they saw the police force
as a crime

586
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,939
against the people living
in the country.

587
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,508
The citizens.

588
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:28,809
Per Wahlöö is dead.

589
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:30,444
Maj Sjöwall is still alive,

590
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:32,746
but they wrote together
as a couple,

591
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:37,417
and they were developing their
characters throughout the series

592
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:40,554
in the most wonderful way,
and I can highly recommend them.

593
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:42,489
They are translated.

594
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,893
They wrote ten, but they
also wrote novels separately.

595
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:50,430
But the first ten here
was their story of a crime.

596
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,201
And they called it a crime.

597
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:56,737
And the crime was society.

598
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:04,244
The way
society treated its citizens.

599
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:07,347
So a very different take
on crime.

600
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,284
And these are the ones
that they wrote.

601
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,653
The beginning
of Scandinavian noir.

602
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:15,656
The phenomenon called
Scandinavian noir.

603
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:20,527
Police procedurals,
where you follow the crime

604
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:24,231
and the police officers
that solve it

605
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:29,870
and get those culprits to their
well-deserved punishment.

606
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,740
And very political.

607
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:36,476
So they started it all.

608
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:41,648
They started the entire wave
of Scandinavian noir.

609
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:45,419
And then there are tons
of other writers.

610
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,087
And I could,
you know, have--

611
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:48,689
I could have just stood here

612
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,725
and spent my time
giving you names.

613
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,327
But I don't want to do that.

614
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:56,330
I just want to point out
that there are lots and lots

615
00:29:56,396 --> 00:29:58,632
of great Scandinavian writers.

616
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,167
And of course, you're saying,

617
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:04,605
"Why is that when Scandinavian
countries are so peaceful?"

618
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,541
Well, your answer
is as good as mine.

619
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:08,709
You know, you can guess.

620
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,043
Well, maybe they're bored.

621
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,380
Let's write some crime stories,
because the rate of crime

622
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:16,216
is definitely very low
in the Scandinavian countries

623
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:19,920
compared to, for example,
our country.

624
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,623
Some of these,
let me show you.

625
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:27,561
Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö,
they wrote ten books.

626
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:30,764
Then Karin Fossum is Norwegian.

627
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,867
And I've just given
you a few titles here

628
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,536
so that if you, you know,

629
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:39,006
if you want to read something
or you are looking for an author

630
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:42,142
that you like, these are some
of the ones that I like.

631
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:45,345
Henning Mankell
was the most amazing,

632
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:47,581
I think, one of the
most amazing writers.

633
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:51,818
He died a few years ago,
and he wrote a series.

634
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:53,587
Normally, you would write
a series

635
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,190
of, like, ten books or more.

636
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,058
And he did that.

637
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,228
<i>Faceless Killers</i> is Wallander.

638
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,696
I don't know
if you've seen it.

639
00:31:02,763 --> 00:31:06,200
It's definitely also
a TV series,

640
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:07,801
Kurt Wallander.

641
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:11,205
And that was a very famous
protagonist.

642
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,940
Kerstin Ekman,

643
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:18,745
who also writes very amazing,
more autobiographical,

644
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:21,815
kind of magical realism novels.

645
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:25,819
Liza Marklund is a huge name,
Swedish.

646
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:29,489
And like Kerstin Ekman,
and Swedish,

647
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:34,228
and she wrote 11 books
in her Annika Bengtzon series

648
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:38,732
with a female protagonist,
and it's hugely popular.

649
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,401
This is a really good example,
<i>Red Wolf.</i>

650
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,003
You don't have to read them
in order,

651
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,772
but if you do,
you'll get her story as well.

652
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,841
You know,
you get the family story.

653
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,376
Jesper Stein is Danish,

654
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:53,380
and he has written a series
around <i>Aisha</i>

655
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:55,516
about immigrants in Denmark

656
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,920
and crimes committed by
and against immigrants.

657
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:03,323
Very dark,
so very, very dark books.

658
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,726
Jo Nesbo, I'm sure you--

659
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:08,095
many of you know him,
Norwegian.

660
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,564
<i>The Devil's Star</i> is one
of my favorites.

661
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:13,133
Otherwise,
I think he's too bloody.

662
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,204
I like psychology more
than blood and gore.

663
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:22,876
Johan Theorin is from Öland,
the Öland islands,

664
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,913
and he writes wonderful books.

665
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,581
Great series.

666
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,849
So he's also,

667
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:33,020
they're all translated,
all ready for you to go to.

668
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:36,990
And Arnaldur Indridason
is from Iceland.

669
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,259
Go for it.

670
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:42,796
So many books,
so many things to read.

671
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,132
So what happened?

672
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:49,503
Well, of course,
you all know Stieg Larsson.

673
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,505
And I'm going to choose.

674
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:54,141
I've chosen
to talk about two authors today

675
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,944
because, whew, I can't talk
about them all.

676
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,478
But I can certainly,
I hope,

677
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:01,281
whet your appetite
so that you can say,

678
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,551
"Ooh, I would love
to read some more."

679
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,520
So in April 29, 2009,

680
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:13,026
and this is absolutely a ways
after he died,

681
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:17,097
because he died in 2005
from a heart attack,

682
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,467
very suddenly, very unexpected.

683
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:24,438
He had just submitted
three manuscripts.

684
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,240
The three original

685
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,543
<i>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>
books.

686
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:32,513
And then he died of a stroke.

687
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:34,615
You know,
it's really interesting

688
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,617
when you read about it
because it's described as if,

689
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:41,655
okay, he had an office which was
up on the seventh floor,

690
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:44,491
and he walked up because
the elevator wasn't functioning,

691
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,560
and then he fell down.

692
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,029
He was a chain smoker.

693
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:51,532
So he was not living
the healthiest of lives.

694
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,568
And he was an incredibly
active person,

695
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:56,870
trying to do
so many good things

696
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:59,573
and writing
and working nonstop.

697
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,110
He was the top
European adult fiction author.

698
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:08,882
He got translated pretty quickly
after his books were published.

699
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,217
And as you can see,

700
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:13,654
13 of the top 40 authors
were writing in English:

701
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,889
Henning Mankell,
Liza Marklund,

702
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:18,125
Jan Guillou,
and Jens Lapidus.

703
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:20,928
And they're all writing
really good crime stories.

704
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:24,298
So you can just start looking
for Scandinavian crime writers

705
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,200
and you are home.

706
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:29,837
<i>The Girl</i>
<i>with the Dragon Tattoo,</i> 2005.

707
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:33,473
Also seen
as a postmodern crime story.

708
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,175
And what do I mean by that?

709
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,911
Well, it's a story
that is fragmented.

710
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:41,315
It's a story
that includes reality.

711
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:45,252
And that has a lot
to do with the society

712
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:48,722
that surrounds us
and is very critical of that.

713
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:53,794
Stieg Larsson himself
was a very interesting person.

714
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,496
How interesting?

715
00:34:56,563 --> 00:35:01,768
Well, his books have sold
more than 100 million copies.

716
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,838
A hundred million,
could you imagine?

717
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,940
Could you even begin to imagine?

718
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:10,677
Well, journalist, author,
communist.

719
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:15,115
Sweden, of course,
is a country

720
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:17,317
that is further
to the left than the U.S.

721
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:20,420
But few communists remain
in Europe.

722
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:23,156
And he died in November 2004,

723
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,560
after he had just submitted
the manuscripts

724
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:31,698
for the first three books
in the Lisbeth Salander series.

725
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:35,102
Wonderful translation,
<i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>

726
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:37,538
because the publishers
did not want it

727
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:40,507
to be called
<i>Men Who Hate Women.</i>

728
00:35:41,074 --> 00:35:43,644
That is the original title.

729
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:46,547
They said,
"No, that won't sell."

730
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:49,583
But it is about men
who hate women.

731
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,652
And then we had
Lisbeth Salander,

732
00:35:51,718 --> 00:35:53,053
<i>The Girl Who Played with Fire,</i>

733
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,389
<i>The Girl Who Kicked</i>
<i>The Hornet's Nest.</i>

734
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:57,591
And they were all
three developed

735
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:01,562
or given to the publishers
at the same time,

736
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:03,630
right before he died.

737
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:07,768
So quite a tragedy
that he didn't get

738
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:11,338
to really benefit
from all these, you know,

739
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,208
wonderful reactions
to his books.

740
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,976
They got, his heirs,

741
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:18,879
that was his father
and his brother.

742
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:23,417
And his "common law" wife
was pushed to the side,

743
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:28,255
pushed to the other side,
didn't get anything.

744
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,489
So that was very sad.

745
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:32,259
They'd been living together
for 32 years.

746
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:35,896
So that's a very sad
kind of side story.

747
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:40,300
She's written about her years
with Stieg Larsson

748
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,269
and talked about it.

749
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:45,038
David Lagercrantz,

750
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:48,775
he continued the story,
hired by the family,

751
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:52,246
the father and the brother
to make them more money.

752
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:53,647
And he did that.

753
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:58,285
And then Karin Smirnoff
was the one who was hired at,

754
00:36:58,352 --> 00:36:59,887
when he kind of got tired
and said,

755
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:01,355
"I want to write
something else."

756
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,690
There's, you know,
very divided opinions

757
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,426
about these kind of sequels,

758
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,899
because Stieg Larsson
had set out to write ten books,

759
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:14,101
like Henning Mankell,

760
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:18,138
like another man
we'll talk about later.

761
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:21,775
Ten seems to be
the kind of golden number.

762
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:24,411
But of course,
he never managed to do that,

763
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,979
so that was very sad.

764
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:28,282
But he was
a fascinating character

765
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:31,818
because he was a
real-time activist,

766
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,656
struggled against racism,
right-wing extremism.

767
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:37,758
He had grown up
with his grandfather,

768
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:40,661
his parents were too young
to take care of him,

769
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:44,698
and his grandfather
actually spent World War II

770
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,135
in an internment camp
because he was a Marxist.

771
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,903
I mean,
if he had been in Germany,

772
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,705
he would've been killed,
but he was in Sweden,

773
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,373
so he was just put in a camp.

774
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,710
And then Stieg Larsson
took up that activism.

775
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:59,713
And <i>Expo</i> magazine was a magazine

776
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,418
that was exposing crimes in
society, real crimes in society.

777
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:08,222
So he knew about
what he sat down to write.

778
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:10,858
And he was living
with Eva Gabrielsson,

779
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:13,794
who did not inherit him,
for 32 years,

780
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,665
and under constant threats
because he was just too,

781
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:24,438
well, good at exposing what
was going on, neo-Nazism,

782
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:27,274
et cetera in Sweden at the time.

783
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:29,510
He was also a workaholic
and a heavy smoker,

784
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:33,180
and he was writing the
Lisbeth Salander series at night

785
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:36,483
after he was done
with his regular job.

786
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,118
So there's also been speculation

787
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,420
that he simply ruined
his health.

788
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,523
But <i>The Girl</i>
<i>with the Dragon Tattoo,</i>

789
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:46,793
the first one, you know, Swedish
society and business fraud,

790
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,797
you went up to the higher levels
of society here.

791
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:54,968
Serial murder, feminism,
he was an ardent feminist,

792
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:57,271
the writer Stieg Larsson.

793
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,373
Investigative journalism,

794
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:03,911
corruption, moral bankruptcy,
you name it.

795
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,579
Have any of you read

796
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,714
<i>The Girl with the Dragon</i>
<i>Tattoo?</i>

797
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:09,383
Some of you have, yeah.

798
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:12,653
And of course,
it was also turned into a movie.

799
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,955
Three Swedish movies.

800
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,958
Please watch the Swedish movies.

801
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:20,227
One American version.

802
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,829
Okay, but not brilliant.

803
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:25,699
But the three
Swedish movies are brilliant.

804
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:28,168
And there are subtitles,
don't worry.

805
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:31,238
So go for it,
it's definitely worth it.

806
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,907
And the moral bankruptcy
of Big Capital, of course,

807
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:38,312
since Stieg Larsson
was kind of very left wing,

808
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:41,715
he wanted to expose that,
and he did.

809
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,650
He managed to do it,

810
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,119
and also show
the right-wing extremism,

811
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:49,289
the neo-Nazis in Sweden
at the time.

812
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:51,325
You, we probably all
think about Sweden

813
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:54,595
as this incredibly peaceful,
progressive country,

814
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:56,163
but they have a lot of issues

815
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,867
and they have a lot of problems
with immigrants, et cetera.

816
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:02,402
And he was talking about this.

817
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:06,406
He was really attacking
everyday problems.

818
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:09,042
So he was so popular after that.

819
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:11,044
And I was lucky enough
to have a visit

820
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:14,648
from one of his friends,
who came and talked about

821
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:16,283
Stieg Larsson
and their friendship

822
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,918
and how he started
writing a book.

823
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:21,688
And it was basically
because he and Eva Gabrielsson,

824
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:26,026
they were on vacation
and she was going nuts

825
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,996
because he was walking around in
circles, didn't know what to do.

826
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:31,365
She was writing a book
about architecture.

827
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,201
And finally, she said to him,
"Do something.

828
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,003
"Write something.

829
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:39,506
Focus and do something
to get out of my hair."

830
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,208
And he said,
"Oh, I've written all these

831
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,377
"little pieces of paper,
you know,

832
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,380
"with kind of themes, maybe.

833
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:50,184
Could you take a look and see
if one of them appeals to you?"

834
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,451
And she said, "Sure."

835
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,888
Just to get him out
of that living room.

836
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,757
And then he started writing

837
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,258
<i>The Girl with the Dragon</i>
<i>Tattoo.</i>

838
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:00,661
So it was totally random.

839
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:02,529
So if you've ever read
the book,

840
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:04,631
you'll notice
that the first 80 pages

841
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,366
are kind of scattered all
over the place,

842
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,568
and then all of a sudden,

843
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,503
oh, that's
when the action starts

844
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,371
and it gets really interesting.

845
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:13,006
So I've always thought,

846
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,641
that's my personal opinion,
of course,

847
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:17,311
but I've always thought
that he took some time

848
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:21,982
to kind of find his own voice
with those books.

849
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:25,986
But that was Stieg Larsson,
and he's absolutely wonderful.

850
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,688
And my other author

851
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:29,489
that I've chosen
to talk a little bit about

852
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,891
is from Denmark,

853
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,593
because, of course,
being from Denmark,

854
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,761
I know more about Denmark
than Sweden.

855
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:38,465
I mean, we've always been
right next to each other

856
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,000
and sometimes rivals,

857
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,369
and most of the time
Sweden has won.

858
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:47,107
But with crime stories,
I think there is equality.

859
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:50,744
Well, Jussi Adler-Olsen
from Denmark,

860
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,280
he started writing in 2007,

861
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,382
and he had done a lot of things
before that.

862
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,484
A very interesting person.

863
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,987
And the first one was called
<i>Kvinden i Buret,</i>

864
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,822
<i>The Woman in the Cage,</i>

865
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,625
translated
<i>The Keeper of Lost Causes.</i>

866
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:06,527
You're thinking about
those translations now?

867
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:07,928
What are they doing?

868
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:10,664
Well, they're trying
to say the woman in the cage,

869
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,467
ooh, it sounds
like some sadistic experiment.

870
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:14,902
It's not, really.

871
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,103
Maybe it is.

872
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,239
If you haven't read
Jussi Adler-Olsen,

873
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,541
you know, go for it.

874
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:22,709
It's really amazing.

875
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:24,311
<i>The Keeper of Lost Causes,</i>

876
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:29,550
and then, you know, he went on
with a number of stories,

877
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:34,288
a number of books about
this Carl Morck detective.

878
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:42,029
And he's called Carl Valdemar
Jussi Henry Adler-Olsen.

879
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:44,264
He's an absolutely
fascinating writer.

880
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:47,401
He's visited my classes
a couple of times,

881
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:49,736
and he's just really interesting

882
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:52,940
and a very exciting man
to talk to.

883
00:42:53,473 --> 00:42:54,908
Lives north of Copenhagen,

884
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:58,512
and he's very active,
just like Stieg Larsson,

885
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:04,017
very active with politics
and things happening around him.

886
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,087
And as you can see,
favorite Danish author.

887
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,423
More than 27 million books
so far.

888
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:12,192
And of course,
when I look up these numbers,

889
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,094
it could be 50 millions
right now.

890
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:17,364
I don't know,
because I found the 100 million

891
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:20,133
about Stieg Larsson
kind of randomly.

892
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,136
So we know they sell
a lot of books,

893
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:26,540
and they are translated,
and very good translations.

894
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,509
So this is his books.

895
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,445
Starts with
<i>The Keeper of Lost Causes,</i>

896
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:33,680
<i>The Absent One,</i>
<i>A Conspiracy of Faith.</i>

897
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,483
And as you can see,
they're all translated.

898
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,087
<i>The Woman in the Cage,</i>
<i>The Keeper of Lost Causes.</i>

899
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:42,789
What he did,
he finished his series.

900
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:45,759
He had, like our first authors,

901
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:49,763
he wanted to write ten books,
and he did.

902
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,433
Sjöwall and Wahlöö,
they did the ten books.

903
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,272
And he finished it
and he said, "I'm done," 2023.

904
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:00,807
And there are
police procedurals as well,

905
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:03,310
but with an array of people.

906
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:05,179
And he also talks
about immigration

907
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:09,216
because one of the main
characters is an immigrant.

908
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:11,752
And there are so many very,

909
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,223
very interesting side stories
in all of his books.

910
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,560
If you haven't read any,
I can highly recommend it.

911
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:23,564
The number ten book
is out in English in December,

912
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,831
and that's it.

913
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:26,934
And they are really
worth reading

914
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,535
because you get a lot
of laughter,

915
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:30,871
but also a lot of reality.

916
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:33,807
It's real with what's going on
in society today

917
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:36,476
in the Scandinavian countries.

918
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:37,644
What are the themes?

919
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:40,013
Well, you know,
I could go on and on and on,

920
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,482
but I thought
I would mention a few:

921
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,418
revenge, human nature,
indifference,

922
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:47,688
control, finding peace,
redemption, sarcasm.

923
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:50,090
Sarcasm is really big
in Scandinavia.

924
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:52,025
That is how you survive.

925
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:56,763
And so, I've had to learn
to tone down my sarcasm

926
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,099
when I moved to the U.S.,

927
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:02,102
to the extent that when
I got home to visit my sister,

928
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,338
she would say,
"God, you are boring."

929
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:05,506
[audience laughing]

930
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,907
"What happened to you?

931
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:09,576
I mean,
everything is so serious now."

932
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:11,945
And I said,
"Well, I live in the U.S.

933
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,614
We can't be sarcastic
all the time."

934
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,450
But that's definitely a tool
to survive.

935
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:19,453
Rules, directives,
politics, politicians,

936
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,955
he mentions it all,
immigration, and immigrants.

937
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:25,726
And as you know or may know,
in the Scandinavian countries,

938
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,895
immigration is a huge issue

939
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:31,365
and being debated near
and wide and far.

940
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:34,168
Elitism, classes,
homelessness, organized crime,

941
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,836
corruption, you name it.

942
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,572
He's got all these
in his ten books,

943
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,407
and at the same time,

944
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:43,977
he's a perfectly wonderful,
nice man that--

945
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:46,547
I never met Stieg Larsson,
I just met his friend.

946
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:49,483
But I've met
Jussi Adler-Olsen

947
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,120
and he is a wonderful man,
really nice and a family man.

948
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:55,189
And you think,
"Where did he get it all from?"

949
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,325
You know, "Where does
it come from when it comes out?"

950
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:00,093
TV series and movies,
okay.

951
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,597
So I thought I would just
mention those two big authors,

952
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:05,732
Stieg Larsson,
Jussi Adler-Olsen.

953
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:07,467
But of course,

954
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:12,105
go and watch Scandinavian noir
on TV or in movies.

955
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:16,777
<i>The Killing</i> is from Denmark
and Sofie Grabol,

956
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:18,579
the main character there,

957
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,882
she got famous
because of her sweaters.

958
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,450
She was always wearing

959
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:26,053
these Icelandic sweaters,
home knitted.

960
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,322
So everybody started
knitting homemade sweaters,

961
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:29,756
as you can imagine.

962
00:46:29,823 --> 00:46:32,292
And they're very warm,
very nice, very pretty.

963
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,027
Great series.

964
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:36,496
<i>The Bridge, Broen,</i>

965
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,100
that was a collaboration
between Denmark and Sweden,

966
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:43,604
because you might know that
from Denmark to Sweden in 2000,

967
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,707
they built a bridge so
you don't have to sail across.

968
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:48,442
It was, like,
20 minutes sailing.

969
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:52,880
Now it's just driving across,
and right in the middle,

970
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:55,682
ooh, the first crime happens.

971
00:46:55,749 --> 00:46:58,552
Oh, now you have to see
what it is.

972
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,687
So very good series.

973
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:03,590
And then there's <i>Trapped</i>
from Iceland

974
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,792
that I can highly recommend
as well.

975
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:07,394
Because all
of a sudden you realize,

976
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:09,329
well, I've been to Iceland
a couple of times

977
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:11,532
and it's definitely icy.

978
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:15,502
And you think,
"Wow, this is really good."

979
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:20,407
The way they describe
the environment and the people,

980
00:47:20,474 --> 00:47:24,044
an incredibly interesting
mixture.

981
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:26,246
And of course, you have movies.

982
00:47:26,313 --> 00:47:27,881
<i>The Girl</i>
<i>with the Dragon Tattoo,</i>

983
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:30,717
The <i>Department Q</i> movies,
that's Jussi Adler-Olsen.

984
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,519
So far they've made six.

985
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:34,721
They call it <i>Department Q.</i>

986
00:47:34,788 --> 00:47:37,858
Kurt Wallander,
numerous series.

987
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,326
I don't know if you've seen

988
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,962
Kenneth Branagh
as Kurt Wallander.

989
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:45,866
And <i>The Snowman,</i> Harry Hole,
that's Jo Nesbo.

990
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:50,037
So, yes, lots and lots
of movies or series

991
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:53,440
that you can delve into
and get caught up in.

992
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:56,043
And it's interesting,
and they're all subtitled.

993
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:59,246
I don't know if any of them
are actually dubbed,

994
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:01,215
but I think most of them
are subtitled.

995
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:03,984
But that's not really bad.

996
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,854
Now we get to the last section
of my talk.

997
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,389
Why is it
that in these peace-loving,

998
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:11,558
nice little kind of
idyllic countries,

999
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,962
we have all these,
well, welfare states?

1000
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,196
They're welfare states,

1001
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,165
which means
that everybody is taken care of

1002
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:19,833
from cradle to grave.

1003
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,403
And yes, there are
homeless people primarily,

1004
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,139
often because they prefer
to be homeless, et cetera,

1005
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:29,109
and yes,
you don't have to be homeless.

1006
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:30,777
You don't have to be poor.

1007
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:33,780
There is a social welfare
system, welfare states.

1008
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:36,016
Boredom,
maybe that makes you bored.

1009
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,051
You want something
that's exciting.

1010
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:40,654
So these are all the questions
that you can ask yourself.

1011
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:42,956
And I've asked myself
all these questions

1012
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:46,159
as I've been reading
all these numerous stories.

1013
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:47,494
Work ethics.

1014
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,497
You work a lot,
but not as much as here.

1015
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:54,935
You really do not want to work
quite as much as in the U.S.

1016
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:57,738
Gender roles,
much more equality.

1017
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,206
Women's roles.

1018
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,875
Denmark has a prime minister
who's female.

1019
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,610
And Norway, too.

1020
00:49:03,677 --> 00:49:09,449
I mean, we have many more women
in political roles than here.

1021
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:12,586
Of course, the thrill,
the "noir" effect.

1022
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:14,288
That name that was invented,

1023
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:16,957
Scandinavian noir,
Nordic noir.

1024
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:19,126
Yes, it's pretty darn dark.

1025
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,461
If you ever go to Greenland
in the middle of winter,

1026
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:23,730
you don't see the sun,
et cetera,

1027
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:26,233
or Iceland, it's really dark.

1028
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,335
So you gotta have something
to do.

1029
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:31,872
Maybe write a book
about Nordic noir.

1030
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,241
A sense of neatness,
tidy countries.

1031
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:37,611
Yes, they're all
very well organized,

1032
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:38,779
from cradle to grave.

1033
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:41,248
And you pay your taxes
and you are registered,

1034
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:45,886
and you cannot escape to another
state and just disappear.

1035
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:48,088
You are a known entity.

1036
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:51,325
So maybe they're bored
and that's why.

1037
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:55,529
But okay, here is what
it looks like in Denmark

1038
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:58,131
in 2024 with political parties.

1039
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:00,534
These are the parties that exist

1040
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:04,471
and are all in the Parliament,
179 members.

1041
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:07,741
So there's a lot of variety
and you have a lot of choices.

1042
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:10,744
You can go left or right
or in the middle,

1043
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:13,080
depending on what
you want to do.

1044
00:50:13,146 --> 00:50:16,783
They're welfare states with the
"Folk-Home" as the background,

1045
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,152
which means
cradle-to-grave security.

1046
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,154
You are taken care of
and you know

1047
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:23,190
that the state takes care
of you,

1048
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:25,792
so you do not have to suffer.

1049
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:28,028
Taxation is that great equalizer

1050
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:30,631
that enables the states
to take care of you.

1051
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,400
But, of course, there are
rich people, financial crimes,

1052
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:35,269
power plays,
and you know everything,

1053
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:38,405
<i>everything</i>
that is crime-ridden,

1054
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:41,341
it exists because there
will always be underground.

1055
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:42,843
There'll always be gangs.

1056
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,513
There will always be people
who want to exploit the system.

1057
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,750
And then there's also
generation gap right now,

1058
00:50:49,816 --> 00:50:51,852
maybe like here,
technology.

1059
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:53,754
Who knows more technology,

1060
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,956
the young ones
or the older ones.

1061
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:57,624
So we see that as well.

1062
00:50:57,691 --> 00:50:59,226
Free education.

1063
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:02,829
So in the Scandinavian
countries, you go to school,

1064
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:04,565
you start at 6 or 7,

1065
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:08,869
and then you can finish with
your PhD and it's all paid for.

1066
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:12,072
So that's what you use your
taxes for, among other things.

1067
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,608
So that's not such a bad deal
if you think about

1068
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:16,410
how long an education is.

1069
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:18,312
And then there's
the immigration issue.

1070
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:21,381
Like I said, Jussi Adler-Olsen
is talking about that.

1071
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:25,285
His assistant is an immigrant
from Syria.

1072
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:28,488
So lots and lots
of various things

1073
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:30,724
you can add into these books.

1074
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:33,393
And for that,
I just wanted briefly to mention

1075
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,696
that there was a real crime

1076
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:40,467
that created what was called
the Muhammad Crisis in 2005.

1077
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:43,604
And that was
because 12 editorial cartoons

1078
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,105
actually depicted Muhammad.

1079
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:48,041
And, you know, for Muslims,
that is a crime.

1080
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,177
And it created an uproar.

1081
00:51:50,244 --> 00:51:53,647
And this was in Danish
newspaper <i>Jyllands-Posten.</i>

1082
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:55,949
And they said it was
"an attempt to contribute

1083
00:51:56,016 --> 00:51:57,484
"to the debate
regarding criticism

1084
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:59,753
of Islam and self-censorship."

1085
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,922
Reprinted
in more than 50 countries.

1086
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:05,192
And oh, boy,
did everything explode.

1087
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:10,130
And Denmark was definitely put
on the blacklist and the draw--

1088
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:12,866
The person
who had drawn the best one,

1089
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,935
there was an attempt
at his life and so on,

1090
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:17,604
and consumer boycott
and burning of flags.

1091
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:22,476
And that is probably the biggest
real crime during the time

1092
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,811
that these books
have been written.

1093
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:28,015
And brings me
to my next question.

1094
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:30,651
As you can see, I'm searching,
why is it so popular?

1095
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:31,818
Why is it so good?

1096
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:32,986
Boredom?

1097
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:35,722
Are we that bored
in Scandinavia?

1098
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,457
Yeah, maybe.

1099
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:40,694
We're so nice
and middle of the road

1100
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:43,197
and you are all
pretty well-educated

1101
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:46,333
and pretty well-behaved,
et cetera.

1102
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,636
So the thrill that you
don't have in your real life,

1103
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:52,039
you can find in a book
if you start writing it.

1104
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:53,540
Drudgery, yeah.

1105
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:54,708
Children?

1106
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:58,145
Oh, you have childcare,
so you're fine.

1107
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:00,214
You have money,
well-functioning,

1108
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,548
carefully planned lives.

1109
00:53:01,615 --> 00:53:05,419
Does it sound boring,
or does it sound relaxing?

1110
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:07,855
Marriages happy
or deteriorating?

1111
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:10,424
Of course, I thought I'd share
the divorce rates with you.

1112
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,961
They're pretty astonishing,
actually, when I looked them up.

1113
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,395
Lots of divorces.

1114
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,298
Lots of people who also live
without being married.

1115
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,934
But, so what is the reason
for this?

1116
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,102
That's what I'm coming to.

1117
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:23,270
What about work ethics?

1118
00:53:23,337 --> 00:53:25,105
Do we work as hard
as in the U.S.?

1119
00:53:25,172 --> 00:53:26,840
No, no they don't.

1120
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:31,712
As you can see,
not really a 40-hour week.

1121
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:34,581
And they usually make
twice as much as we do,

1122
00:53:34,648 --> 00:53:37,217
but then they pay half of it
in taxes.

1123
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:40,721
So I'm generalizing,
as you can tell, broadly.

1124
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:43,957
But yeah, so as you can see,
I'm reaching.

1125
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:46,994
You know, what are the answers
to this popularity?

1126
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,062
Working above and beyond
expectations?

1127
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:50,564
Yeah, maybe not.

1128
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:53,233
But the procedurals,
the police procedurals,

1129
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,972
they kind of also incorporate
the drudgery of everyday life.

1130
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,441
Then the immigrant workers,

1131
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:04,845
some people that work more,
lots of social issues

1132
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:09,183
that can give food
for thought, and gender roles,

1133
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,851
of course, is one of them.

1134
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,920
A lot of gender equality there.

1135
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,822
Feminine,
according to Geert Hofstede,

1136
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:17,658
if you know his
cultural dimensions,

1137
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:19,693
women are in the workplace.

1138
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,431
Salary inequality still
not in the public sphere,

1139
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,235
but in the private sphere.

1140
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:32,039
The public sphere,
there is equality.

1141
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,540
Maternity leave?

1142
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,509
One year, thank you!

1143
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,478
With pay, so there you go.

1144
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:39,813
I mean, that's a difference.

1145
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:45,219
And today, it's shared, so
that the mom gets some months,

1146
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:49,356
the dad gets some months, or you
share it and you figure it out.

1147
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:53,794
But actually, it's seen as an
important thing to have babies,

1148
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:58,432
and the states feel
that that should be rewarded.

1149
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:01,802
Leadership inequalities
in the private sector,

1150
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:04,905
many, many more men
than women.

1151
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,307
The glass ceiling,
that's where you hit it,

1152
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:10,677
if you are a woman
in the private sector.

1153
00:55:10,744 --> 00:55:13,547
Nurses, teachers, doctors,
pedagogical assistants?

1154
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:14,882
Guess what?

1155
00:55:14,948 --> 00:55:16,216
Women still.

1156
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:18,085
Yes, also doctors.

1157
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:19,486
Ministers?

1158
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:22,890
Well, it's about 40% women,
60% men.

1159
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,259
So, not so bad.

1160
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,361
Especially not compared
to the U.S.

1161
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:31,465
And immigrants have been
an issue for a number of years,

1162
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:33,133
and still is something

1163
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,469
that the countries
are struggling

1164
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:38,772
to find that
ultimate solution to.

1165
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,440
So what is the thrill?

1166
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:41,675
Where does that come from?

1167
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:45,646
Well, I like
the possible identification

1168
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,649
and identity formation.

1169
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:52,186
If you can identify with
a character in a crime story,

1170
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:55,589
I think you find
it really relevant and exciting

1171
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,858
and maybe you can learn
something from it.

1172
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:59,226
So there you go.

1173
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:03,497
That's why real crimes,
real people, real solutions,

1174
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:04,731
even though you could say,

1175
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:07,334
"But there aren't any crimes
in these countries."

1176
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:11,004
Well, not that many,
but there are enough

1177
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:15,409
that they can spark
some imagination about it.

1178
00:56:16,243 --> 00:56:17,911
Okay, well,

1179
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:21,181
I don't know if you've ever been
to the Scandinavian countries,

1180
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:22,983
but they are neat.

1181
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,553
Tidy, homogeneous people,
it used to be more homogeneous.

1182
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,990
Now about 10% of the population
is immigrants.

1183
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,692
Clean cities and roads,

1184
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:34,261
of course,
environmental concerns,

1185
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:37,731
everybody's going green
and lots of wind power,

1186
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,733
solar power, thermal power,

1187
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,569
electric cars
all over the place.

1188
00:56:42,636 --> 00:56:46,340
Electric cars
are incredibly popular.

1189
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,042
Much, much more so than here.

1190
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,912
Bikes and e-bikes,
especially e-bikes.

1191
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:54,414
I know people
who have been riding their bikes

1192
00:56:54,481 --> 00:56:56,350
their entire lives.

1193
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,719
That's their means
of transportation.

1194
00:56:58,785 --> 00:57:00,988
Doesn't matter if it's 30 miles.

1195
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:04,424
Oh, it just takes a little bit
longer, et cetera.

1196
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:07,261
Cleaning up after criminals,
yes.

1197
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,129
And like, remember,

1198
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:12,566
when you go to jail for life,
16 years,

1199
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:16,770
and you get out after 12,
rehabilitation.

1200
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:19,373
So under the surface,
there are still problems.

1201
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:24,645
I'm not trying to present to you
the Nordic countries as ideal.

1202
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:26,280
They have different issues

1203
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:28,782
and they do have problems
with immigrants

1204
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:32,452
that are not used to this
kind of "lifestyle"

1205
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:34,054
or choice of lifestyle.

1206
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:37,124
Trafficking in women
happens especially in Sweden.

1207
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:41,762
The underworld and the gangs
are now beginning to be more,

1208
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:44,264
well, ubiquitous, you could say,

1209
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:47,968
especially in the bigger cities,
especially again in Sweden.

1210
00:57:48,035 --> 00:57:51,672
Sweden has more problems
than Denmark and Norway.

1211
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:53,473
Social system as a trap.

1212
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:57,244
Well, you get from
cradle-to-grave in a way.

1213
00:57:57,311 --> 00:58:00,414
So maybe you're not spurred on
to be more ambitious,

1214
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,982
to become a millionaire.

1215
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:03,317
It's not that important

1216
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:05,419
because
you will be taken care of.

1217
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,354
Waiting lists
and bad service,

1218
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:11,091
well, because it is,
you know, paid for by the state.

1219
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:15,462
So maybe that private initiative
is lacking a bit.

1220
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:18,932
High taxation,
so a lower standard of living,

1221
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,134
even though
the salaries are higher.

1222
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:23,103
Inequalities still.

1223
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,806
And it's not 50/50
with men and women.

1224
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:28,509
I'm not trying
to paint a rosy picture.

1225
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:30,244
But what is left?

1226
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:35,449
I didn't want to end on that,
"Oh, my gosh,

1227
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,684
everything is horrible
in Scandinavian countries."

1228
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,487
So here are some
of my nine grandchildren

1229
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:43,724
that are very nice,
and hygge, of course,

1230
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,760
the ubiquitous concept
everywhere.

1231
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:48,929
And you do a lot to hygge

1232
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:52,232
because winters are dark
and long.

1233
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,936
And you light candles,
and they can be electric candles

1234
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:57,504
or real candles,

1235
00:58:57,571 --> 00:59:00,941
and you make sure that you have
something good to drink,

1236
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:02,676
tea and a good book

1237
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,280
and some
home-knitted socks, et cetera,

1238
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:10,284
and then you make sure to have
some grandkids and a sunset,

1239
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:14,488
and all of a sudden,
it's not so bad after all.

1240
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,424
I hope I answered some
of your questions,

1241
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:21,195
and if not, I am very happy
to answer them now.

1242
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:23,497
[audience applauding]
