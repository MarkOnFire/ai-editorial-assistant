00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:01,902
Meet Andrew Linskens,

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:05,472
a Green Bay artist
who turns bold marks into murals

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,275
that bring entire communities
together

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,645
through the Art-Hop Collective,
Andrew and fellow artists.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,847
Blend music and painting

6
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:17,317
live at Packers
games and local events.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,821
For Andrew, every brushstroke
is about connection,

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,790
transforming memories of loss
into something vibrant

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,594
and healing,
from canvases to stadium walls.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,431
His art reminds us
that creativity isn't just seen.

11
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,166
It's felt.
