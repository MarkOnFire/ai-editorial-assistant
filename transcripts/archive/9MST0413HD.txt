00:01:57:14 - 00:02:23:13
Speaker 1
Welcome to West Bend, Wisconsin, which is situated with the Milwaukee River bends west. I love it when the name makes sense. West bend has a population of about 31,000 people. It is in southeast Wisconsin, about three hours north of Chicago, and less than an hour northwest of Milwaukee. It is in the middle of Washington County, where U.S. highway 45 and State Highway 33 intersect.

00:02:23:15 - 00:02:27:15
Speaker 1
This is West Bend.

00:02:27:18 - 00:02:30:12
Speaker 6
Now, I'll tell you how West Bend got its name.

00:02:30:15 - 00:02:32:29
Speaker 1
We've already covered that. Oh. What? What else you.

00:02:32:29 - 00:02:36:02
Speaker 6
Got? Okay. Do you know how a West Bend really became a hub?

00:02:36:04 - 00:02:36:19
Speaker 1
Nope.

00:02:36:22 - 00:03:00:11
Speaker 6
Talk to me. All right. Good. So, 1840s Milwaukee. Thriving. Fond du Lac. Thriving. But to get between the two took more than a day of travel. And that was by horse. So it was just a long, long trip. So they decided, let's try to find a good halfway point to give travelers an option. Surveyors came in. They realized the ideal spot was right where the Milwaukee River had a little bend west.

00:03:00:14 - 00:03:03:02
Speaker 6
Yeah. Bend west. That's the community's name.

00:03:03:03 - 00:03:05:21
Speaker 1
And obviously, not everybody just passed through.

00:03:05:22 - 00:03:15:08
Speaker 6
No, no. They stopped. Especially once the railroad came to town and got built, which was back in 1873. That brought new residents and new businesses. And the economy was really good.

00:03:15:09 - 00:03:18:23
Speaker 1
So business wise, those that put their roots down doing. Do I know any of them?

00:03:18:27 - 00:03:24:10
Speaker 6
So West Bend mutual insurance. Oh, sure. West bend aluminum company. Amity leather.

00:03:24:11 - 00:03:28:08
Speaker 1
Oh, that's what we got for eighth grade graduation. And Amity Leather.

00:03:28:12 - 00:03:28:18
Speaker 6
Oh.

00:03:28:18 - 00:03:31:03
Speaker 1
No way. Yeah. Amity leather billfold is what we got.

00:03:31:04 - 00:03:32:11
Speaker 6
Oh, I love that.

00:03:32:12 - 00:03:42:16
Speaker 1
I also read that in the 1930s, business was so good that West Bend, Wisconsin was one of the only cities in the entire United States that did not suffer the Great Depression.

00:03:42:19 - 00:03:50:11
Speaker 6
Oh. That's incredible. Well, they're still really strong. And so much is made here. Egg equipment and plastic graphics and still insurance.

00:03:50:11 - 00:03:59:11
Speaker 1
And time's up. So, yeah, we got to get to it. Here we come. People know West Bend because of West Bend insurance stuff.

00:03:59:16 - 00:04:06:25
Speaker 8
Yeah, well, they they knew West Bend first because of pots and pans. Yes. Oh, sure. And I would like to say they know West Bend because of the silver lining. That's our brand, Kevin.

00:04:06:26 - 00:04:12:05
Speaker 1
I grew up knowing this as West Bend Mutual. Why is it now just West Bend Insurance Company?

00:04:12:06 - 00:04:21:26
Speaker 8
So a lot of mutual insurance companies are now going to what's called a holding company. West bend Mutual Holding Company. So it's still a mutual, but we now refer to yourselves as West Bend Insurance Company.

00:04:21:26 - 00:04:22:20
Speaker 1
Prairie center. What is.

00:04:22:20 - 00:04:41:07
Speaker 8
This? So in 2008, we doubled the size of this building, and we decided to build this conference center. And so this hosted all of our company meetings and hosts all of our agent meetings, but also hosts well over 100 nonprofit meetings, gala celebrations. Yeah, it really does become a great asset for our community and a meeting place for so many people and so many organizations.

00:04:41:09 - 00:04:43:06
Speaker 1
Did you come here for West Bend Insurance?

00:04:43:08 - 00:04:48:23
Speaker 8
Yes, we came here from West Bend Insurance. My wife and I've been here 30 years. And then I retired in March and they still got me working.

00:04:48:27 - 00:04:54:19
Speaker 1
You're you're retired. I am retired. Talked about the five GS. Yeah. What are they again? I have A5G.

00:04:54:20 - 00:05:09:28
Speaker 8
What's your plan? And this order? It's priority. It's God, it's grandma, which is my wife. It's grandchildren. Yeah, it's golf and gardening. And that's in order. But my wife claims I have a daughter, that I'm golfing, you know, golfing and gardening too much in summer. Yeah. That's right.

00:05:09:28 - 00:05:11:11
Speaker 1
Cause it's limited.

00:05:11:11 - 00:05:12:16
Speaker 8
That's what I told her. Yeah.

00:05:12:18 - 00:05:15:04
Speaker 1
And you told me, that you still have an office here?

00:05:15:08 - 00:05:32:03
Speaker 8
Yeah, yeah. Now, really involved in a group of private citizens who helped create a 20 year master plan for our city. And one of the first things was to green up downtown. And so they did a beautiful job of redoing downtown. We're involved in the Riverwalk. Looks great. Yeah. And, you know, people come and our surprised and then leave saying, I'll be back.

00:05:32:05 - 00:05:37:06
Speaker 1
Yeah. And if somebody says Westborough Mutual, you're not like, listen. No, it's a.

00:05:37:11 - 00:05:44:03
Speaker 8
I love it. In fact, I get called all the times at Western. Do you? Yeah. It's okay, but you're retired. Yeah, I can do that.

00:05:44:06 - 00:06:08:21
Speaker 1
That's one thing you can't help but notice. In West Bend is all the new residential properties, which is great. Right here at the north end of Main Street in West Bend is a brand new complex called the district. And then there's the repurpose old buildings with the new residential life like the Aberdeen Leather Works headquarters. Don't you wonder if it still smells like a leather in there?

00:06:11:25 - 00:06:20:08
Speaker 1
We're on Main Street in downtown West Bend at a place called the Norberg. It's part of a restaurant group that has two restaurants, the Norbert and The Orville. Where did those names come from? Sure.

00:06:20:10 - 00:06:24:23
Speaker 8
My grandfather, Norbert, born in 1913. And my other grandfather or.

00:06:24:23 - 00:06:27:02
Speaker 1
Oh, wow. Yeah. And concept wise,

00:06:27:09 - 00:06:39:01
Speaker 8
We do world cuisine here. So we're always doing new flavors, and then up the street, it's a little bit more traditional. It would be reminiscent of a Wisconsin supper club. Yeah. Slash bistro. I also wanted to do.

00:06:39:04 - 00:06:41:04
Speaker 1
Something a little bit more metropolitan.

00:06:41:04 - 00:06:59:03
Speaker 8
In a small town. Why don't we just bring some of that to us? Span. So that's what we did. It starts with the executive chef. Carl, and I really invite him and his staff at both restaurants to think outside the box. We try to keep every customer experience really unique to the customer. Yeah, and to their dining preferences.

00:06:59:07 - 00:07:02:08
Speaker 8
This is our scallops. So that's a sweet corn and miso broth.

00:07:02:14 - 00:07:05:25
Speaker 1
And small plates are small plates. So people are sharing these small plates.

00:07:05:25 - 00:07:13:13
Speaker 8
Exactly. These incredible. His landscape on the flavors and things. He he's willing to try and bend even for a.

00:07:13:13 - 00:07:14:16
Speaker 1
Big metropolitan area.

00:07:14:16 - 00:07:20:07
Speaker 8
Like Milwaukee or Chicago. He's doing it right here in one spot. These incredible. Our little play on fried chicken.

00:07:20:07 - 00:07:21:08
Speaker 1
Fried chicken. Yeah.

00:07:21:12 - 00:07:37:16
Speaker 8
I think we have a reputation in the community that they know we don't put out bad food. So I think that opens up a lot more people to trying things. We try to push seasonality, but then things will rotate in and out depending on availability. What do you think of the great fried chicken place?

00:07:37:19 - 00:07:40:10
Speaker 1
For somebody to have a taste of this. What do you hope for?

00:07:40:11 - 00:07:48:24
Speaker 8
I want you to try something that maybe it's outside your comfort zone. Yeah. Yeah, we really like to put a twist on it. See how far we can push our piece of fried chicken. You know.

00:07:48:27 - 00:07:58:13
Speaker 1
This is kind of my favorite right here. Thank you. Yeah. There's something about West Bend, though that really works for a restaurant like this now. Yeah, I think there's a real energy that's happening here. People love you.

00:07:58:13 - 00:08:04:03
Speaker 8
Here. I'm so blessed. Yeah, I'm. This is a great community.

00:08:04:05 - 00:08:26:14
Speaker 6
I am going to get my steps in today. Have you ever walked a labyrinth before? I have not, but I assume most people in West Bend have because. Look at this. This is a beautiful labyrinth. It's 90ft in diameter and made up of seven circuits. The flowers are outstanding. I mean, this is beautiful. How about a slow stroll down a riverwalk?

00:08:26:16 - 00:08:42:07
Speaker 6
They have put a lot of time and money into beautifying this space. And let me tell you, it makes all the difference. Old Settlers Park is so pretty in the summer, but trust me, come back during the holidays. You will thank me. West bend is so walkable.

00:08:42:09 - 00:08:59:04
Speaker 1
West bend covers 14.72mi², which is, about 9400 acres. 1300 of those acres is occupied by what?

00:08:59:06 - 00:09:18:05
Speaker 6
There are 36 properties within 1300 acres that make up open space. Parks, rivers, woods, ball, diamonds and so much more. And a big thanks to the City of West Bend Parks and Recreation and Forestry Department. They take care of it all.

00:09:18:07 - 00:09:22:04
Speaker 1
I'm standing in front of. I used to be the Washington County Jail.

00:09:22:07 - 00:09:37:05
Speaker 9
It was built in 1886, hence the name 1886 jailhouse. Yeah. So in the first half of the building, it was a residence. Feels very much like a home. So this front room was the sheriff's office. You would be fingerprinted and then have your picture taken.

00:09:37:07 - 00:09:38:22
Speaker 1
This is the booking.

00:09:38:25 - 00:09:40:25
Speaker 9
Photo with all the numbers.

00:09:40:27 - 00:09:43:14
Speaker 1
So it was. It was the sheriff that lived here.

00:09:43:17 - 00:09:49:11
Speaker 9
So the sheriff and his family. And it was really a whole household chore to keep this place operating.

00:09:49:13 - 00:09:58:05
Speaker 1
Arrest report May 21st, 1920. Infractions Michael Bickford leaving his horse unattended on Main Street.

00:09:58:07 - 00:10:04:01
Speaker 9
But then when you walk straight down the center hallway, it's a dramatic flash of a change to the cellblock.

00:10:04:02 - 00:10:05:28
Speaker 1
So the house is cut in half.

00:10:06:00 - 00:10:06:24
Speaker 6
So this cell.

00:10:06:24 - 00:10:08:15
Speaker 9
Block had plumbing.

00:10:08:18 - 00:10:12:28
Speaker 1
Plumbing? Yes. An overnight guest. And it's metal floor.

00:10:13:02 - 00:10:16:00
Speaker 9
So there's four cell blocks down here, and then another four on the top.

00:10:16:01 - 00:10:29:09
Speaker 1
I'm going to be good. I don't want to go to jail. Not quite a whirlpool. That was a sitz bath, wasn't it? Here's where the where you got your visitors. How's it going in there?

00:10:29:12 - 00:10:33:28
Speaker 9
This was an active operating jailhouse for 75 years.

00:10:33:28 - 00:10:34:22
Speaker 1
75 years?

00:10:34:24 - 00:10:45:07
Speaker 9
Yep. And then the state came. Told Washington County. Look, guys, you've got to build a better facility with more security and better amenities. So they did.

00:10:45:09 - 00:10:49:20
Speaker 1
It's kind of amazing. The whole thought of, like, the family taking care of all of this.

00:10:49:24 - 00:10:57:10
Speaker 9
It's a beautiful home. But you would hear the noise, you would get to know the people staying there, right? Shut up. I know.

00:10:57:12 - 00:11:01:24
Speaker 1
And career wise, there's not many tours that this is open. When there's a special.

00:11:01:24 - 00:11:12:20
Speaker 9
Event, you can set an appointment and we'll do our best to give, like a bespoke custom tour. Our long term vision is to reactivate the space once again.

00:11:12:23 - 00:11:39:03
Speaker 1
Lights out boys! Stay safe everyone. Talk about longevity business wise in West Bend. Tennis ace hardware, Winkler's office, city Hussars, House of Fine Diamonds, still owned and operated by the same families that started these businesses over 50 years ago. Longevity business West bend.

00:11:39:05 - 00:11:41:15
Speaker 8
Yep.

00:11:41:17 - 00:11:43:28
Speaker 1
We're at Ray's Shoe Repair in West Bend.

00:11:44:04 - 00:11:52:28
Speaker 10
35 years ago. Yeah. Every town had a shoe repair. Everything's changed. People don't fix watches anymore, right? You don't fix your TV. You just go to Walmart, buy a new one.

00:11:53:00 - 00:11:56:29
Speaker 1
But people come in to to get shoes resold. Yeah.

00:11:57:01 - 00:11:57:23
Speaker 8
That's probably for.

00:11:57:23 - 00:11:59:06
Speaker 10
Soles. He's had on that shoes.

00:11:59:08 - 00:12:01:06
Speaker 1
How many years has he been wearing these, do you think? Oh, I.

Speaker 10
Budget 2535.

00:12:02:25 - 00:12:06:14
Speaker 1
Oh, I hope he's watching.

00:12:06:16 - 00:12:08:05
Speaker 10
So that's a red wing boot.

00:12:08:08 - 00:12:09:16
Speaker 1
He's working that guy, isn't he.

00:12:09:16 - 00:12:16:19
Speaker 10
Well, that's a new. So it's turned into more sewing. Actually. You got a person who got a belt in. It's. It's a lot of sewing stuff.

00:12:16:27 - 00:12:25:28
Speaker 1
I've worn these for years so it looks like the stitching has come out. Tell me, tell me. Oh, why won't why won't you stitch it. Well, it's.

00:12:25:28 - 00:12:29:06
Speaker 10
Actually fake stitching.

00:12:29:08 - 00:12:32:21
Speaker 1
Will you glue these and put a little sole on their glue?

00:12:32:23 - 00:12:34:17
Speaker 10
Stick that on. Feel like.

00:12:34:20 - 00:12:35:08
Speaker 1
I do?

00:12:35:10 - 00:12:37:10
Speaker 10
That's what you got to do. If you. If you like it, fix it.

00:12:37:12 - 00:12:40:06
Speaker 1
Yeah. Who taught you to do this stuff?

00:12:40:09 - 00:12:45:04
Speaker 10
My dad. My brother took a course at MIT, you see, in Milwaukee. So it was just kind of like a side business.

00:12:45:04 - 00:12:46:13
Speaker 1
For your dad after retirement.

00:12:46:14 - 00:12:48:20
Speaker 10
Yeah. Something to do. Ten years from now.

00:12:48:20 - 00:12:51:07
Speaker 8
You do have a hard time finding a shoe repair.

00:12:51:10 - 00:12:53:26
Speaker 1
And there's nobody here. No young guy who came in here and say.

00:12:54:02 - 00:13:04:01
Speaker 10
Said wants to buy it for $1 million. No, half a million. I want to talk, but not for.

00:13:04:04 - 00:13:18:12
Speaker 1
This is right where the West Bend Company used to be. In 1921, they introduced a product that became the most popular seller. They called it the waterless cooker. Do you have any idea what a waterless cooker might be?

00:13:18:14 - 00:13:31:05
Speaker 6
But who knew? A waterless cooker? Also a crock pot? I had no idea. I had the West Bend Aluminum Company to thank for making dinner so easy for me.

00:13:31:07 - 00:13:37:02
Speaker 8
In this building, we think we make the best cooker in the world. About 95% of everything we sell is made right here in West Bend, Wisconsin.

00:13:37:04 - 00:13:42:02
Speaker 1
We're talking about Regal, where we're inside the factory at certain jobs. This is Ryan Regal.

00:13:42:03 - 00:13:43:29
Speaker 8
Hello, John. She is right next door.

00:13:43:29 - 00:13:47:07
Speaker 1
It's Regal. Where Regal and Regal is your last name?

00:13:47:07 - 00:13:47:24
Speaker 8
Yeah, that is great.

00:13:47:24 - 00:13:49:06
Speaker 1
But it's not spelled the same.

00:13:49:06 - 00:14:03:16
Speaker 8
It's not a little bit different. My great grandfather changed the name back in the early 50s to Regal Regal wear, so it was easy to pronounce. And we also put the crown on it, so it's all good. We became the crowning touch in housewares so that that's what happened.

00:14:03:16 - 00:14:06:09
Speaker 1
So a West Bank company and Regal, where we're two different companies.

00:14:06:13 - 00:14:07:05
Speaker 8
Fierce competitor.

00:14:07:05 - 00:14:07:16
Speaker 1
Fierce.

00:14:07:16 - 00:14:17:15
Speaker 8
Competitor cutters Regal Wear and the West Bank company. We lived in everybody's homes. Yeah. As we help America grow up with American manufacturing and housewares, it just got.

00:14:17:15 - 00:14:20:03
Speaker 1
So regal where it took over. What was the West Bank company?

00:14:20:05 - 00:14:22:17
Speaker 8
That's correct. And today we're we're one big happy family.

00:14:22:18 - 00:14:26:08
Speaker 1
We're in the factory at Synergy Arts, which is really part of Regal Flair. Yeah.

00:14:26:08 - 00:14:26:16
Speaker 8
Right.

00:14:26:17 - 00:14:27:26
Speaker 1
When you did that, why?

00:14:27:28 - 00:14:43:13
Speaker 8
It was all part of our bigger strategy. We're going to create these incredible divisions and we're seeing opportunities. John, we haven't seen quite literally probably 20 or 30 years. We have Chinese manufacturers coming to us to ask us to make product. When's the last time anybody's heard of that?

00:14:43:16 - 00:14:46:06
Speaker 1
So in China it will say made in USA.

00:14:46:06 - 00:14:48:05
Speaker 8
Made in the USA, made in the USA.

00:14:48:07 - 00:14:52:03
Speaker 1
Is there room to grow in in the building that you're in? Absolutely there is.

00:14:52:07 - 00:14:59:21
Speaker 8
When we do implementations of robotics or lean practices, it's it's never about reducing headcount.

00:14:59:23 - 00:15:02:29
Speaker 1
Like this is working on a product today that may change tomorrow.

00:15:03:01 - 00:15:06:24
Speaker 8
That's the name of the game is it's consistency as well as flexibility. And the brain.

00:15:06:24 - 00:15:10:05
Speaker 1
Work that makes this work are the people that work here as well.

00:15:10:11 - 00:15:16:01
Speaker 8
And it's about how do you ultimately find the right people that can do this stuff.

00:15:16:03 - 00:15:19:19
Speaker 1
This isn't going to melt stuff on the gas.

00:15:19:21 - 00:15:23:08
Speaker 8
Oh, we're good. We'll do it one more time. Got to have a little fun else.

00:15:23:11 - 00:15:26:09
Speaker 1
Shut up. Sean.

00:15:26:12 - 00:15:45:12
Speaker 8
I quit working, and that's why I love what we make. Our products are incredible, but I think it's our people that are really the most important thing. And that's kind of cliche to say, but I truly, truly mean it. The products are a byproduct ultimately of the people we have. And this product right here. This goes to, over 60 different countries around the world.

00:15:45:14 - 00:15:52:11
Speaker 8
Wow. And we're here in West Bend, out of West Bend, out of West Bend. So great.

00:15:52:14 - 00:16:16:03
Speaker 6
It is always so fun to feature a community's local treasure. And here in West Bend, that treasure is the Isaan Bond Trail. I haven't been, actually is a German word that means iron road, since that's exactly what it was made to be back in 1871. The Washington County segment of this trail was finished in 2006, and it is a local favorite.

00:16:16:05 - 00:16:22:21
Speaker 6
Why did I bring my dog gourmet steez? I did one thing right. I didn't bring my horse.

00:16:22:24 - 00:16:45:16
Speaker 1
Okay? I want to test your age and your memory. Do you remember the exclusive company? Oh, come on, you do. There were 11 of them. The original one, 1956, downtown, West Bend. This is it now. It's called The Beat Goes On. Just a few years ago, vital was out and CDs were in. Now, CDs out, vinyl back in.

00:16:45:18 - 00:16:59:22
Speaker 1
So everything old is new again. I am so no, you. Know we're not in my closet. These are costumes. This is all yours.

00:16:59:22 - 00:17:00:14
Speaker 6
It is all mine.

00:17:00:21 - 00:17:01:13
Speaker 1
Let's talk.

00:17:01:19 - 00:17:03:13
Speaker 6
Okay.

00:17:03:16 - 00:17:07:16
Speaker 1
19 years you've been here. Yes. And you're a costumer?

00:17:07:22 - 00:17:08:04
Speaker 6
Yes.

00:17:08:09 - 00:17:12:14
Speaker 1
You're a costume rental lawyer? Yes. You're a costume builder?

00:17:12:15 - 00:17:12:27
Speaker 6
Yes.

00:17:13:02 - 00:17:14:14
Speaker 1
Follow us.

00:17:14:16 - 00:17:33:02
Speaker 6
This is toys and games like Mario. Food and drinks? Yeah. Wizards. Wizards, your elves, your Santas and the later wholesome. And then here's all the kilts. These are, farm animals and chickens. Chickens are popular. 30s, 40s, 50, 60, 7080s.

00:17:33:04 - 00:17:33:28
Speaker 1
Are you keeping up?

00:17:33:28 - 00:17:39:01
Speaker 6
And that's clowns. We keep the clowns in the back because you'd be surprised how many people are afraid of clowns.

00:17:39:04 - 00:17:41:20
Speaker 1
How many customers are in the shop?

00:17:41:22 - 00:17:44:25
Speaker 6
Well, the thing is, there's pieces. So I would say there's at least 10,000 pieces.

00:17:44:25 - 00:17:47:01
Speaker 1
This is an entire row of capes.

00:17:47:01 - 00:17:55:24
Speaker 6
Here's our pirates. Our uncle Sam's, our leprechauns, our Easter bunnies. How about a minion and arms out there? Pull your own shorts down.

00:17:55:26 - 00:17:57:07
Speaker 5
It's very hard to see.

00:17:57:09 - 00:18:00:11
Speaker 8
What are you looking at?

00:18:00:13 - 00:18:01:28
Speaker 6
Some of them have built in fans.

00:18:02:01 - 00:18:06:01
Speaker 1
Obviously, you didn't give me one of them.

00:18:06:03 - 00:18:08:19
Speaker 6
People that are coming in or coming in to have fun.

00:18:08:21 - 00:18:16:10
Speaker 1
I had a fancy aunt. Her name was Aunt Luanne. So Aunt Luanne, all the masks on top.

00:18:16:18 - 00:18:21:14
Speaker 6
We have the scary ones on the side because the little kids will come in and cry. And then I'll go, oh, look, there's the Flintstone.

00:18:21:16 - 00:18:24:06
Speaker 1
O'Brien. Are there many of these still?

00:18:24:09 - 00:18:27:23
Speaker 6
There was a guy in from Madison who said, it's either you or Chicago.

00:18:27:26 - 00:18:31:23
Speaker 1
The thought that this is just you, it's kind of amazing to me.

00:18:31:27 - 00:18:37:15
Speaker 6
Oh, thank you.

00:18:37:18 - 00:18:39:12
Speaker 6
This is one of your favorite places.

00:18:39:12 - 00:18:40:20
Speaker 1
One of my favorite places.

00:18:40:20 - 00:18:50:18
Speaker 6
Yes. We are at MOA museum of Wisconsin Art. This is my first time here. Yeah. So does that mean that all of the art in there is just by Wisconsin.

00:18:50:18 - 00:18:58:12
Speaker 1
Artists, Wisconsin ers, and those who have connection to Wisconsin? Oh, cool. Yeah. We're outside. Okay. This is the garden, right?

00:18:58:13 - 00:18:59:01
Speaker 6
Beautiful.

00:18:59:04 - 00:18:59:26
Speaker 1
What do we have here?

00:19:00:01 - 00:19:03:02
Speaker 6
They look kind of like a white birch from Aspen.

00:19:03:02 - 00:19:05:01
Speaker 1
Oh, okay. Do you have any idea how many there are?

00:19:05:02 - 00:19:06:05
Speaker 6
Like 400?

00:19:06:09 - 00:19:11:03
Speaker 1
Yeah, 702. 000. And to look at what we have here, beautiful hydrangeas.

00:19:11:03 - 00:19:11:13
Speaker 6
How many.

00:19:11:13 - 00:19:11:28
Speaker 1
Of them.

00:19:12:00 - 00:19:13:28
Speaker 6
I don't know, 300, 1200.

00:19:14:00 - 00:19:19:09
Speaker 1
Oh, you can come any time of the year and enjoy the outdoor space. What I love most is what's inside.

00:19:19:11 - 00:19:26:07
Speaker 6
I'm a little intimidated by museums. I have to tell you, I'm really glad we're going in together. Because you know so much and I know so little.

00:19:26:10 - 00:19:36:07
Speaker 1
So what they have here is five permanent collection galleries. These are them, okay. They have two exhibition galleries, and then they have these flexible spaces where art is exhibited.

00:19:36:09 - 00:19:39:09
Speaker 6
I did not know museums had pieces of this size.

00:19:39:09 - 00:19:41:17
Speaker 1
Would that fit in your living room? No, no.

00:19:41:17 - 00:19:42:08
Speaker 6
One. Three.

00:19:42:10 - 00:19:51:09
Speaker 1
That's that's Carl Von Meyer, I believe that was painted in the 1800s in Germany. But his family ended up in Milwaukee and this is on loan.

00:19:51:12 - 00:19:53:20
Speaker 6
It's on loan because they don't have a place to put it.

00:19:53:20 - 00:20:01:18
Speaker 1
Obviously they've got. Yeah, at their family rooms, a little smaller. I wonder what it looked like to you.

00:20:01:21 - 00:20:03:18
Speaker 6
The prettiest balloons I've ever seen.

00:20:03:20 - 00:20:07:14
Speaker 1
You beat balls, but it's blown glass.

00:20:07:16 - 00:20:11:10
Speaker 6
It's called milk and cookies. But I don't see cookies anywhere in the piece.

00:20:11:12 - 00:20:12:14
Speaker 1
Milk and cookies.

00:20:12:14 - 00:20:14:12
Speaker 6
Right. Where is it.

00:20:14:15 - 00:20:18:03
Speaker 1
Emmy? The artist is time you check. But I want you to guess the name of that.

00:20:18:03 - 00:20:25:27
Speaker 6
Well, I see two groupings of each animals. I might say it's like a North Noah's Ark.

00:20:25:29 - 00:20:29:25
Speaker 1
Not close. No, no, it's called wipe my tears.

00:20:29:28 - 00:20:35:27
Speaker 6
Are we on time? Because there's some pretty good shops downtown that have really great snacks and things.

00:20:35:27 - 00:20:37:16
Speaker 1
We're very different.

00:20:37:19 - 00:20:42:03
Speaker 6
We I want to I'm going to go see the downtown.

00:20:42:05 - 00:21:07:11
Speaker 6
I just love it. Downtown. Filled with cute little shops. Oh, candy necklace, gummy bears. Total score. Yes. Oh, the mountain mix. A little sweet, a little salty. Look at this. Voted one of the top eight burgers in the state. Now stop following me so I can find a table and eat.

00:21:07:13 - 00:21:13:10
Speaker 1
I don't think she really enjoyed it.

00:21:13:12 - 00:21:32:21
Speaker 1
If you were to coming to the West Bend Music Academy and say, oh, they just sell instruments here and they just give music lessons here, you would be wrong because even though they do both those things here in the basement, they have a video and podcast studio. So people have a place to record, and they're developing new technology so that they could help students learn.

00:21:32:23 - 00:21:35:28
Speaker 1
And to think, I just came here to look at a guitar.

00:21:36:00 - 00:22:00:15
Speaker 6
I came in just for an iced coffee, and then I realized there's a whole lot more good things going on here. So the Volunteer Center of Washington County owns and operates this nonprofit cafe called Social Good Ruins. The volunteer center is also housed in this building. And part of every tip that you leave here, it goes back into the community and is shared among 58 different nonprofits.

00:22:00:17 - 00:22:04:08
Speaker 6
I'll drink to that.

00:22:04:11 - 00:22:16:16
Speaker 1
Coming to West Bend, I was so excited about this story. It's called The Bend. It's the theater in downtown. I'm so glad that this sign is lit up. And again, the doors are open because for a long time it wasn't.

00:22:16:23 - 00:22:25:18
Speaker 8
That's right. It was closed for about ten years. And then our nonprofit, the historic West Bend Theater, we acquired the building in about 2016, 2017.

00:22:25:21 - 00:22:27:01
Speaker 1
And what shape was this building?

00:22:27:01 - 00:22:33:16
Speaker 8
And actually horrible. There was there was actually a hole in the ceiling. Wow. So rain was just pouring in and the basement was flooded.

00:22:33:21 - 00:22:35:10
Speaker 1
Talk about the history of this building.

00:22:35:12 - 00:22:44:02
Speaker 8
The building opened in November of 1929. It originally was a vaudeville stage and then it was a movie theater after that for about 80 years.

00:22:44:09 - 00:22:48:12
Speaker 1
And now the mission and purpose of this building is what.

00:22:48:19 - 00:22:57:12
Speaker 8
It's really a community space. When we did this restoration, we had to do $4.6 million in fundraising. We said this was going to be a community space.

00:22:57:12 - 00:23:00:16
Speaker 1
Yeah. So here we are with 100. How many seats on the.

00:23:00:18 - 00:23:01:27
Speaker 8
130 on this floor?

00:23:01:27 - 00:23:09:11
Speaker 1
So if it's if it's a small, intimate show, you can turn those lights. And this is and and you can add a couple rows. Yes, yes. Yeah.

00:23:09:11 - 00:23:13:00
Speaker 8
We have some table seats that we put out there. Have a little place for their bottle of wine.

00:23:13:00 - 00:23:14:19
Speaker 1
Right.

00:23:14:21 - 00:23:17:20
Speaker 6
Because there is a bar.

00:23:17:23 - 00:23:32:17
Speaker 8
You know during the restoration the big we call it the blade. The big West Bend sign was taken down and people were really upset because when you look down Main Street, what do you see? The big West side. Right. So they were so happy when it came back.

00:23:32:20 - 00:23:33:27
Speaker 1
I have come back and.

00:23:33:27 - 00:23:35:21
Speaker 8
We had one of those big light switches.

00:23:35:28 - 00:23:36:20
Speaker 1
Oh really? Yeah.

00:23:36:22 - 00:23:41:28
Speaker 8
Yeah. When we have sellout crowds then we change the lighting configuration to a racetrack.

00:23:42:01 - 00:23:46:15
Speaker 1
When they drive up they're like, oh, it's the racetrack. I can't get.

00:23:46:18 - 00:23:52:26
Speaker 8
My tickets up in time. We have a lot of people tell us that this is where they came for their first states. Yeah, their first kiss.

00:23:52:26 - 00:24:00:05
Speaker 1
So this is iconic to this community. And the fact again, that these doors are open is just such a joy for this community. Thanks for talking to me.

00:24:00:06 - 00:24:02:02
Speaker 8
Bet you it's our pleasure having you here.

00:24:02:02 - 00:24:07:18
Speaker 1
Thanks.

00:24:50:29 - 00:25:02:18
Speaker 8
All right, so what do we do again? Oh my God, I get.

00:25:02:20 - 00:25:09:10
Speaker 2
We thank the underwriters of down Midland's main streets because without them, we couldn't make this show.

00:25:09:13 - 00:25:38:15
Speaker 3
Yes. Greendale is beautiful on the outside, but it's what's inside that counts. Who doesn't love opening a door to great food? Whether you want to go casual. Upscale. Or maybe you want to try something brand new. You come on in. You just got to see green down.

00:25:38:18 - 00:25:48:21

No. Exactly.
