00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,175
- Erica Halverson: Learning
anything new

2
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,610
requires taking a risk.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,881
You can't just say to somebody,
"Okay, take a risk."

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,350
You have to do what's called
scaffolding,

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,752
which simply means
creating a structure

6
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,454
around the outside of something

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,457
that's designed to be
peeled back over time.

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,625
- Carrie Bernards: Many times,

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,826
when a classroom teacher
is saying,

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:26,994
"Hey, we're gonna
write narratives

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,929
or we're gonna write a
persuasive piece,"

12
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,031
we had a lot of students
who were just like,

13
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,366
"You want me to write what?

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,634
And how do I do this?"

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,403
And there'd be a lot
of shutting down of behaviors.

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,705
When Whoopensocker
started to come in,

17
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,642
they were like, "Hey, we can get
the kids to write."

18
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,911
And it was through play,
it was through acting,

19
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,779
it was through generating ideas.

20
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,782
And now, an engaged writer
will be like,

21
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,385
"Oh, my gosh, I have this great
idea that I just thought of."

22
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,854
You can see the success,
the feeling of pride

23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,590
that the students are having now
with writing.

24
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:00,761
- At Whoopensocker, we structure
our entire program,

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,162
from beginning to end,

26
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,465
to scaffold kids
into taking risks

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,335
with their bodies
through movement,

28
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,138
with their ideas
through storytelling,

29
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,974
and with one another
through collaboration.

30
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,344
- Kailea Saplan: One thing that
we do as teaching artists

31
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,348
that any teacher can learn
is to say "Yes, and."

32
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,084
That's part of improv
and theater.

33
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,520
And we very much take it
to heart in Whoopensocker.

34
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,056
So when a student
brings something to us

35
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,824
and shares their idea,

36
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,962
we immediately yes that idea
with some excitement

37
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,664
or with just some affirmation.

38
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,300
- Aubrey Donaldson: So I'm
thinking of a student this year,

39
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,635
who's newer to the country.

40
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,904
And I was looking through his
notebook one day

41
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,907
and he had, like,
a whole YouTube page spread

42
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,275
in his notebook.

43
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,278
And so his story was kind of
like a YouTube page.

44
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,880
And it had, like, "like"
and "subscribe,"

45
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,549
and it had all the little,
like, bells and whistles.

46
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,784
It was obviously a story about,
you know,

47
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,486
what was really relevant to him.

48
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,155
He was just so cute
and just looked so empowered

49
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,658
and happy to share his ideas.

50
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:10,030
- Even if we as teachers need
to shift the idea a little bit

51
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,632
or kind of redirect the idea,

52
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,901
the most important part
is that "yes" at first,

53
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,702
and really affirming
the contribution

54
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,106
that the student made,
because it is a risky activity

55
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,342
to raise your hand
and share something out loud.

56
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,777
- There's a few ways

57
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:28,549
that we imagine you using this
collection in your classroom.

58
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:33,153
One is to treat the collection
as a single residency day

59
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,889
as we would when we go
into the classroom.

60
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,991
So we have a video series

61
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,627
which first introduces everyone
to the world

62
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,863
of Whoopensocker City.

63
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,400
Then we have a series
of warm-up game videos

64
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,269
that will allow you to work
with your students

65
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,372
and with our Whoopensocker
teaching artists via video

66
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,109
on a series of scaffolded
warm-up games

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,047
that get kids comfortable
working with their bodies,

68
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,383
working with one another,
and working with their voices.

69
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,586
Moves on to a brainstorming,

70
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,122
and then ends with individual
writing and sharing time.

71
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,825
Another way is to take it
in pieces.

72
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,927
So, if you are looking for ways

73
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,364
to bring more arts-integrated
practice into your classroom,

74
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,033
you could just use these
warm-up games

75
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,305
as a daily or weekly activity
when working with your students.

76
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,307
And, if you want to mix
and match,

77
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,443
just connect your favorite
warm-up games

78
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,945
with your favorite
writing activities.

79
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,948
- I love inviting students
into Whoopensocker City.

80
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:40,087
There's this theatrical element,
this imaginative space

81
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,824
where we all create
Whoopensocker City

82
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,327
with our minds
and with our imagination.

83
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,397
We build Whoopensocker City
with the brainstorm

84
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,533
that we create with the games
that we play together,

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,637
but also, with this willingness
to play pretend with each other.

86
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,838
- Kids are supposed to play.

87
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,840
That's where they do most
of their learning.

88
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,975
The seamlessness
between that time,

89
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,812
which you think is very silly
and just not serious,

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,081
and then going back
to their little tables

91
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,483
and getting their notebooks out

92
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,285
and there's just, like,
this hush

93
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,953
that kind of comes over the
classroom.

94
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,521
Such a magical time.

95
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,257
- I learned that Whoopensocker
means something extraordinary.

96
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,460
And I really do think
Whoopensocker is extraordinary.

97
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,462
It brings a lot of joy
to a classroom.

98
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,264
And I think that that's the base
of teaching.

99
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,734
If kids have joy and excitement,
it really is an outlet for them

100
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,004
to have creativity
and to show who they are

101
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,439
as a person and a learner,

102
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,541
and gives them
so many other options

103
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:39,079
and paths to help guide them
for in their future.
