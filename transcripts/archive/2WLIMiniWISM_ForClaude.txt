1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,505
- Ken Fager: I'm not
a superstitious person.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,707
I don't believe
in the paranormal

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,976
or anything like that,
but I do believe that

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,611
the closest thing to magic
that we have

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,614
are the things that we can
create out of nothing.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,015
My name is Ken Fager.

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:20,754
I'm a photographer, Madison
denizen, and creator of MiniWI.

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,725
The Mini Wisconsin project
kind of got its start

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,427
when I would distribute these
little Capitols

10
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,297
in Little Free Libraries
across town

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,634
and people got really excited
about it.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,102
And it being the pandemic,

13
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,771
people were searching out new,
novel things

14
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,141
to stay entertained,
to keep their sanity.

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,478
So this is the original
MiniWI model.

16
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,181
The very first thing
that I created

17
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,982
was actually the
Capitol building,

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,151
the Wisconsin Capitol building.

19
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,388
It has straight edges,
it has curves, it has a dome,

20
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,623
it has various features on it,

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,927
and I needed to practice
how to make objects.

22
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,595
[keys clacking]
Eventually,

23
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,730
things spiraled out of control

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,366
as my desk kept filling up
with prototypes.

25
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,502
And that's kind of when
I decided,

26
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,905
"Oh, well, I don't want to just
throw these away.

27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:16,143
I can maybe just give them away
and we'll see what happens."

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,278
[bubbling]
It took off like wildfire.

29
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,980
People were looking for them

30
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,149
in Little Free Libraries
left and right.

31
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,485
There was clearly a shared need
in our community

32
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,555
for positivity, for discovery.

33
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,060
Something to focus on that was
a little more positive

34
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,563
than the world around us
at the time.

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,898
- Beth Rasmussen: Yay!

36
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,868
I started collecting the MiniWI
when I found this one,

37
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,769
and I just thought
it was so charming.

38
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,873
I thought, "How many people
can hold on to the Capitol?"

39
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,875
So then I started making sure

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,510
I stopped by the
Little Libraries

41
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,845
as often as I could.
[laughs]

42
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,447
- Michael Weerts: I'm just
really into people,

43
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,615
like, hiding treasure and stuff.

44
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,916
[laughs]

45
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:59,086
He's kind of making life
like a video game a little bit,

46
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,289
like he's providing a side quest
for me to do.

47
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,092
- Caroline Sullivan: I got into
collecting these sculptures

48
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,127
when COVID was happening.

49
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,563
I don't know how I ended up
finding Ken,

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,465
but I found him on Instagram.

51
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,501
And, you know, COVID, it was a
tough time for a lot of folks,

52
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,838
myself included,
as an extrovert.

53
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,575
- I'm incredibly fortunate
to have this group of people

54
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,578
that are passionate about
finding my art,

55
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,482
and there are times where I have
to stop and just appreciate that

56
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,553
I have something that
a lot of people don't.

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,355
Did I think it was gonna
catch on when it started?

58
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,890
Absolutely not.

59
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,626
This is not something that
I ever anticipated

60
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,363
that I would still be doing
to this day several years later.

61
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,200
So every MiniWI comes with,

62
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,303
well, the MiniWI itself,
a little bit of candy

63
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:54,274
because life is short and you
gotta have sweet things in life.

64
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,043
[upbeat music]

65
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,278
Some of the MiniWI models
that I have made, of course,

66
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,613
are the Capitol.

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,217
I've made Wisconsin icons itself
of the state.

68
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,620
I've done little Lambeau,
a Camp Randall.

69
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,657
I recently did a flamingo,
paying homage

70
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,794
to the prank on Bascom Hill
at the university.

71
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,996
I've done a badger,
the Bitsy Badger,

72
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,832
which was incredibly popular.

73
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,567
Oh, I've done a cow, of course.

74
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,935
I can't forget the Mini Moo.

75
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,438
That one is <i>very</i> beloved.

76
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,309
- Maryjane Behm: I probably
found 15 or 16 of them.

77
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,044
- I have 24.

78
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,046
- Five, six, seven,
I have eight,

79
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,315
which is my lucky number.

80
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,784
- Ken: That one's special.

81
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,822
So I have, according
to my own estimations,

82
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,459
distributed over 5,000 MiniWI
so far.

83
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,863
One thing that I sort of take
a perverse pride in

84
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,300
is that it is impossible
to collect them all.

85
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,468
Actually, I think my mother

86
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:57,371
probably owns the
most complete set,

87
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,374
but she doesn't have them all
either.

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,077
Another interesting facet of the
relationships that I have

89
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,079
with people who like this art

90
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,816
is that I don't get to see
the reactions

91
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,786
that most people have to my art.

92
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,489
But every now and then,
people do reach out,

93
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:19,993
and they say things like, "I was
having the worst day today,

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,663
"and I just happened to check
in a Little Free Library

95
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,264
"and I found your art.

96
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,432
"I found the MiniWI,

97
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,901
and it really gave me
a little bit of hope."

98
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:32,239
And it's messages like that
that really validate my efforts

99
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,877
to spread small acts of kindness
around in the community.

100
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,279
- What I would say to Ken is,
"Thank you so much

101
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,781
"for allowing me to freak out

102
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,716
when I found one
in front of you."

103
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,718
- Oh, I'd shake his hand
and say, "Thank you.

104
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,953
You're doing a good thing."

105
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,156
The world needs more whimsy
like he's providing.

106
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:52,025
- Thank you, thank you, thank
you for spreading whimsy,

107
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:57,564
your sharing of your time
and energy and capital. [laughs]

108
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,234
Thank you so much.

109
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,804
- What is in the future
for the MiniWI project

110
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,340
is a question that I get asked
quite a bit,

111
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,842
and that I refuse to divulge.

112
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,178
But I can guarantee it'll be
Wisconsin theme,

113
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,280
and that's all I'm gonna
tell you.

114
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,015
[gentle music]
