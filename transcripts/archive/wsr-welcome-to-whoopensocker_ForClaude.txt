00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,945
- Jay: Hey, wanna go
to Whoopensocker City?

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,747
- Gigi: Where is that?
- I'll show you.

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,817
Why don't you come along
with us?

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,526
- So where are we going exactly?

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,528
- Jay: Can you teach us about
Whoopensocker City?

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,263
- Kai: Of course!

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,466
Let's go.
- Jay: Let's go!

9
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,168
Whoo-hoo!
[Kai chuckles]

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,536
- Hi, I'm Kai.

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,138
I'm kind of an expert builder
here in Whoopensocker City.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,373
And now, with your help,

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,041
we're going to build
Whoopensocker City

14
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,709
from the ground up!

15
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,344
- With what?
- Shepherd: Stories!

16
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,113
We love stories
here at Whoopensocker,

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,583
and we want to help you get your
stories out into the world.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,951
While you're here,

19
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,054
we'll play games to help get you
in the right mindset,

20
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,857
we'll show you how to start
stories with our brainstorms,

21
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,693
and we've got notebooks,
we've got props,

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,228
and a supportive environment.

23
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,297
Everything that you need
to get going.

24
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,631
I'm Shepherd, by the way,

25
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,567
and here's Dawry, another
seasoned Whoopensocker citizen.

26
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,734
- Hello.

27
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,336
Let me introduce you
to our cabinet stockers.

28
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,737
They make sure everyone
has a button

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,172
to activate their force fields,

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,174
a selection
of musical instruments,

31
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,577
of course the bits,
of course the bobs,

32
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,147
to make sure that everyone can
be their most creative self.

33
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,782
Go ahead, check inside
of your head!

34
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,051
What do you got in there?

35
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,219
- Ooh!
[hands clap]

36
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,954
Cool!

37
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,789
- Pretty cool, right?

38
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,425
There's a lot going on
in Whoopensocker City,

39
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,126
even more now that you're here.

40
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,962
So, go ahead, explore!

41
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,563
And start writing those stories,

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,099
because we can't build
Whoopensocker City

43
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,400
without your ideas.

44
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,202
- And let us be the first
to say...

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,205
- All: Welcome
to Whoopensocker City!

46
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,075
Where stories come to play!
