1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,366
Nestled among the gently

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:04,800
rolling hills of southern Wisconsin
is something you might not expect:

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,600
a magnificent Tibetan Buddhist temple.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,933
The temple opened in 2007
and is part of the Deer Park Buddhist

5
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:14,900
Center and Monastery, whose origin story
goes back roughly half a century.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,800
The central figure in this story is Geshe
Lhundub Sopa, a Tibetan monk and scholar

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,200
who fled his native country following
the Chinese army's invasion in the 1950s.

8
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:28,766
By 1967, Geshe
Sopa was teaching at UW–Madison, where

9
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:32,666
he eventually became the first Tibetan
tenured in an American university.

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,733
What would become the Deer
Park Center started out with gatherings

11
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,333
of students interested
in Tibetan Buddhism and culture at

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,800
Geshe Sopa’s Madison home in the 1970s.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,900
By 1981,
there was a need for a dedicated space,

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,700
and so land for a Buddhist
center was purchased in Oregon, Wisconsin.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,866
Later that year, the Dalai Lama himself
came to perform the Kalachakra

16
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,766
Empowerment ceremony, 
a special blessing

17
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,733
that had never been done
in the Western world.

18
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,066
Today, the Deer Park Buddhist Center
and Monastery is one of the country's

19
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,066
most vibrant institutions
for Tibetan Buddhist teachings

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
and the monastic lifestyle—

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
thanks in large part to Geshe Sopa’s 
desire to preserve these traditions.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,066
