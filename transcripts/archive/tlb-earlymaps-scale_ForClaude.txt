1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,128
One of the great conveniences 
of maps is their size.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,755
You can have maps of 
all different sizes.

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,215
A map scale is the indication of 

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,885
how distances on the map
relate to distances in the real world.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,304
There are a few different 
ways to do this.

6
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,391
A representative fraction
shows the scale as a ratio.

7
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,602
The first number,
the numerator is always one.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,813
The second number 
the denominator

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,024
is how much greater the 
real world distances.

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,735
So if the scale is 1 to 100,

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,279
it means one unit of distance
on the map equals

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,823
100 units of distance
In the real world

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,742
That distance unit
can be anything

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,578
 centimeters, feet, 
miles, whatever.

15
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,913
Iit holds true no matter 
what unit you're using.

16
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,709
Another option is to use a 
graphic scale.

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,587
These are bars that show 
distances on the map itself.

18
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,964
The maps we looked at here
have scale bars.

19
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,967
They show how many miles are represented
by the measured lines.

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,220
This one even has different
miles used by different countries

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,182
at the time, since this was before
measurements were standardized.

22
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,226
Another way a map might show
scale is simply in writing.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,190
A map might say one inch represents
one kilometer or something like that.

24
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,694
Whatever method is use scale is 
crucial for using a map to navigate
