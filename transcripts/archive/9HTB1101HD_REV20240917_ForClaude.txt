21
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,291
- Hello and welcome to
<i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,417
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

23
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,999
We're checking out
what's cooking

24
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,999
at Zócalo Food Park
in Milwaukee,

25
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:14,999
a vibrant spot celebrating
food, culture, and community.

26
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:18,250
This food cornucopia
is located on 6th Avenue

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,500
within the historic
Walker's Point neighborhood.

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,999
[bustling salsa music]

29
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,959
"Zócalo" is
the native Mexican word

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,959
for plaza
or public square,

31
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,875
and that's exactly what's here,

32
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,959
housing a collective
of food trucks

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,875
offering a myriad
of cuisines.

34
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:39,999
Visitors can enjoy the flavors
of Puerto Rico, South Korea,

35
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,166
Japan, and Mexico.

36
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,999
There are
spicy chicken sandwiches,

37
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,125
tacos,

38
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,458
sushi,

39
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,500
ice cream,

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,917
and an indoor tavern.

41
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:52,667
The space was established
to help entrepreneurs

42
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:55,458
launch and grow
their food endeavors

43
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,500
while creating a gathering place
for community.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,583
Zócalo's incubator program
expands that mission,

45
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,542
offering a space
and business guidance

46
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,834
for budding entrepreneurs.

47
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,750
It's a great way to celebrate
Milwaukee's entrepreneurs

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,083
while digging in
to some tasty treats.

49
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,792
We'll try the food here
in a bit.

50
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:16,999
[shimmery music]

51
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,875
But first, let's head
to a mini-golf course

52
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,375
in Door County

53
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,500
where players are bringing
their A-game to the green.

54
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,792
[water lapping rocks]

55
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,999
- Angela:
Visit the town of Ephraim
in Door County

56
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,999
and you'll discover
the sights and sounds

57
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,041
are pretty much
par for the course.

58
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,417
- Tracy Opper:
The harbor, the bay,
everything is beautiful.

59
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:45,291
It's one of the best sunset
spots when you're downtown.

60
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,041
Really good place
to be, to live, and to visit.

61
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,583
[waves splashing]

62
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,208
- Putter around
further north, however,

63
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:57,208
and those sites and sounds
take a dramatic swing.

64
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,999
[upbeat, playful pizzicato]

65
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,667

[metallic clatter]

69
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,709
- Welcome to
the Red Putter!

70
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,417
- Tracy Opper:
I love to play mini-golf.

71
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,834
I love to watch people
play mini-golf.

72
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:27,999
[golf swing whips air]

73
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:28,999
- Meet Tracy Opper.

74
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:32,999
She and her father played
their first round of mini-golf

75
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:35,458
at the Red Putter in 1992.

76
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,999
- Tracy: His name was Bob Yttri.

77
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,999
He would tell you
his name was Bob with one 'O'.

78
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,667
[laughs]

79
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:48,750
- Soon after, Tracy was told
that the Putter had been sold.

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,999
Who bought it was a bit of a
mystery to everyone around town,

81
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,083
to everyone
except Bob with one 'O'.

82
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,417
- One of my friends
started telling me, like,

83
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,999
"Oh, no,
somebody bought the Putter!

84
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,125
"What are we going to do?

85
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,125
I hope they don't change it!"

86
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,125
And my mom and dad
were sitting there one day,

87
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,999
and my dad just
got a big old smile on his face.

88
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,750
And my mom looked at him
like, "You didn't!

89
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,834
You didn't buy it
without telling me, did you?!?"

90
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,625
[chuckling]

91
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,291
- He did indeed,
and for the next 24 years,

92
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,999
the Red Putter became
a serious passion for Bob.

93
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:24,500
[man laughing]

94
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,542
- Chris Otter:
It's serious and not serious
at the same time.

95
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,875
- Chris is Tracy's husband.

96
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,999
Some would say he sort of
married into the business.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,999
- Tracy:
We had our wedding reception
here, and it was fantastic.

98
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,583
They played mini-golf
all day,

99
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,999
and it was--
it was such a fun time.

100
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,999
- As time passed,
the Putter became so popular

101
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,417
the idea of a tournament
was brought up.

102
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,999
- Chris: The gist of it is,
basically,

103
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,959
there were some people bragging
about their scores.

104
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,333
The short story is
Bob said, "Prove it!"

105
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,750
And he said, "I'm going to
make them prove it.

106
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,999
I'm going to
set up a tournament."

107
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:11,583
- Thus, the Red Putter Pro
Tournament was born.

108
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,333
- So many people
will come here and say,

109
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,667
"Oh, you have a tournament?"

110
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,999
And we're like, "Yeah.

111
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,792
You got to qualify to get in."

112
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,250
"Oh, sure, what's qualifying?"

113
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, you got to get one under.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,625
You know, it's 41,

115
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,083
"Oh, sure,
absolutely, you know."

116
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,667
They'll be all cocky about it.

117
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,291
They'll go play.

118
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,500
They'll come
and set their putter down,

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,166
like, "I'll see you tomorrow,"
and then, they'll leave.

120
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,500
You know, this place,
it seems unintimidating

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,166
until you're playing it.

122
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,333
And then, you get
halfway through, you're like...

123
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,500
- Golfer: Oh, too hard!

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,458
- It's intimidating.

125
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,250
- The tournament
is made up of three rounds.

126
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,375
The person with the lowest total
score is declared the winner.

127
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,834
- Yeah, nice!
[laughter]

128
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,375
Nice, buddy!

129
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,750
- They receive
a trophy,

130
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,667
a cash prize,

131
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:04,250
and something that could
only come from the mind of Bob.

132
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,417
- Chris: He ended up
watching the Masters,

133
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,083
and he called up Tracy,
and he said,

134
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,917
"They keep talking
about this green jacket.

135
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,125
What's with the green jacket?"

136
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,083
So, she explained it
to him.

137
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,458
There was a pause on the phone,
and all of a sudden, she went,

138
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,999
"We're getting a red jacket,
aren't we?"

139
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,625
[laughter]

140
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,875
- That's right!

141
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,417
The winner of
the Red Putter Pro Tournament

142
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,000
gets their very own
red jacket.

143
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,917
- Tracy: We've had stories
of people wearing it to prom

144
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:39,542
or for graduation pictures, so
that's always fun to hear about.

145
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,500
- Sadly, Bob is
no longer with us,

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,250
but you don't have to
look far

147
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,542
to see that his presence
is still felt.

148
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,999
- Tracy: He became
so well-known.

149
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,999
He had been a bartender
for a number of years,

150
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,041
and I think that kind
of personality came out,

151
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:56,999
like, over the counter.

152
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,999
Whether it's the bar
or the mini-golf counter,

153
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,166
kind of the same thing.

154
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,375
You're talking to people.

155
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,166
He meant a lot
to a lot of people.

156
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,208
- The Red Putter
remains in steady hands.

157
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,999
- I guess we always knew we'd
want to keep it in the family.

158
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,375
It's a great, fun business

318
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,999
because there's been
so many immigrant groups

319
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,208
that have come through
this neighborhood.

320
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,750
Most recently, we've had
an influx of Hispanics

321
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,834
come into this neighborhood,
Latinos.

322

that incubator space model

that you all use?

324

wanna start a restaurant

325
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,083

326
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,999
you're looking almost
at about half a million

327
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,250
to a million of investment
to go that route,

328
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,792
but if we can provide
someone a food truck,

329
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,750
they can start their business
for about

330
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,458
anywhere from
$20,000 to $40,000.

- Big difference, right?

332
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,917
So, it just, it opens up
the playing field.

333
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,917

like you said, to ownership,

- Absolutely.

that spirit,

336
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,375
in the diversity
of the participants you have

337
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,375
within this food truck park?

338
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,917

like a rocket.

486
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,999
- At La Crosse Speedway,
Bentley races for herself

487

as open to all.

that you are welcome
in the sport,

As it says on the car,

is also the color
of the Trans Pride flag.

That visibility
conveys a message.

497
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,208
- It keeps it fun,

498
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,583
and it's easy to notice,

499

505
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:19,291
helps Bentley build a team
of people new to the sport.

is a fixture at Pride events.

at least finish
