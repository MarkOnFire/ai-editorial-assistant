1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,676
- Hunter VanZile: It's very
nerve-wracking at the start.

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,978
We could all crash

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,214
and we could all go through
smoothly.

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,950
But when they wave
the green flag,

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,687
all the pain, all the anxiety,
nervous,

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,258
everything just drops.

7
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,233
My name's Hunter VanZile,

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,738
and I drive a Pro Spec
for Championship Off-road.

9
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:42,042
This one is the
Forest County Potawatomi Cup.

10
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,111
We're all as a family,
we're all communities

11
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:48,148
coming together
and enjoying the racetrack.

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,451
That's Forest County Potawatomi.

13
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,194
My dad let me race
short-course karts

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,262
about nine years ago.

15
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,631
He supports me
more than anything.

16
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,466
It's just, he's my backbone.

17
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,902
He's taught me everything
he knows,

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,771
and I've learned from that.

19
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,441
We kind of had
that bonded, two heads at it,

20
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:19,446
and we knew what we needed
to do to be involved in racing.

21
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,917
He'll tell me, like, to do this.

22
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,919
And then I'll say,
"No, let me do this."

23
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,221
And there's just,

24
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,022
he knows a little bit more
than I do,

25
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,824
and I know a little bit more
than him.

26
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,360
We work our way through it.

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:41,068
My first-ever race,
my dad was my spotter.

28
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,070
I had no idea what I was doing
out there,

29
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,639
but we got lucky
and got a third.

30
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,442
As soon as I got up on the
podium, I knew, I was like,

31
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,244
"All right, this is exactly
what I wanna do

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,113
the rest of my life is do this."

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,884
Back then, was just,
it was just a family thing.

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,353
And now we have sponsors,
the community,

35
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:04,091
my family, friends,
everyone's there with me now.

36
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,729
After I won in Bark River,
the tribe,

37
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,866
Forest County Potawatomi
and the whole community seen it.

38
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,469
And that really exposed me
out there.

39
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,571
I got my name out there,

40
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,642
and I was the first-ever
Native American to do it.

41
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,111
That caught a lot of people's
attention.

42
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,380
That's when I felt like

43
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:31,552
the community was right with me
the whole entire time.

44
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,488
Yeah, I try to give back
as much as I can.

45
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,089
I would love to work
with the tribe.

46
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,427
I usually bring my truck
up to the rec center

47
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,197
to show the kids, like,
what it's all about.

48
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,433
Yeah, they always wanna get in
and touch every button in there

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,404
and just slam the gas
is what they wanna do.

50
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,210
Anyone is willing to help,
if you ask.

51
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,680
I might not know the guy,
but if I ask,

52
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,249
"Hey, can I get a hand with this
on my shock setup?"

53
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,319
I mean, they're willing to help.

54
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,821
There's been times
where I broke parts

55
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,323
and I needed help.

56
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,924
Yeah, there's always people
that are willing

57
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,793
to help us get there.

58
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,800
I got a lot of friends
that are supporting us.

59
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,268
Sponsors is a big thing.

60
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,471
I mean, Forest County Potawatomi
has been there since I started.

61
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,241
I have a lot of family
supporting me,

62
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,544
a lot of friends
that will support me.

63
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,945
I have my dad helping me,

64
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,948
and my mom's there to cook
and keep us fed and everything,

65
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,751
and my sisters are there
for the entertainment.

66
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:42,489
Everyone, every single one
of them keeps me happy.

67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,794
Even if I travel out far,
Crandon's my hometown.

68
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,765
This whole community
is all there with me.

69
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,901
