- Mercury Stardust: It's all
about helping the person

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,542
who's the most marginalized,
right?

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,743
It's all about helping
the person

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,713
who knows the least in the room.

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,684
Nothing makes you feel
more of a human

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,021
than when you are helping people
in need.

8
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,689
Hey there, hi, my name is
Mercury Stardust.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,026
I'm the intersectional feminist
trans maintenance lady.

10
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,761
I can help you.

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,699
I was a professional
maintenance technician

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,234
at a property management company

13
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:39,640
where I had to take care of
150 units, about 500 residents.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,009
It was a really tough job.

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,779
On day one, I heard people
talk about racial slurs.

16
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,815
Day one, I heard people say
transphobic things.

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,350
That can be really difficult

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,387
to be able to be a marginalized
person in that space

19
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,389
because you want there
to be change,

20
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,458
and you don't wanna
be a problem.

21
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,764
I was scrolling TikTok,

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,066
and then I saw someone
who was very upset.

23
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,268
It was as a mom of, like,
two or three kids.

24
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,371
She was, you know, crying
in this video, saying,

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,174
"Hey, I don't know what to do."

26
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,976
And when you're watching a video
like that,

27
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,046
as a person who was often told
I was stupid

28
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,149
for not knowing certain things,
I related to her in that moment

29
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,718
and I wanted to educate her
in a way

30
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,720
that I wish I was educated to.

31
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,522
So I turned on the camera
and I said,

32
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,790
"Hey, I'm gonna make a video."

33
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,092
I had no idea what I was doing.

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,094
Oh, that is a great question.

35
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,496
Let me show you what this
little thing does.

36
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,033
I posted the video and I didn't
really think much of it.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,736
Woke up the next morning,
I had, like, 100,000 followers.

38
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:46,206
That video had now hit, like,
600,000 people.

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,076
And my life changed so fast.

40
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,646
A lot of you are new here,
so let's do an intro, shall we?

41
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,315
My name is Mercury,
and I am the Trans Handy Ma'am.

42
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,586
Get a piece of cardboard, place
it right underneath the nail.

43
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,088
This is a flange plunger.

44
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,257
It's gonna make your life
a whole lot easier.

45
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,360
I would work my 10-hour shift
and then I would clock out,

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,963
and then I would go and do,
like, a four-hour live.

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,765
And I would sit there
in a live stream

48
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:12,966
and just answer questions.

49
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,701
- This video is
for Mercury Stardust,

50
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:15,969
the maintenance lady.

51
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,971
- When the management came to me
and said,

52
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,407
"Hey, we found your TikToks

53
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:24,278
and those funny little videos
online," as they called them,

54
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,046
were not rubbing them
the right way.

55
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,648
I left in 2021,

56
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,450
about three months after I
started my TikTok career.

57
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,952
But yeah, I haven't looked back
since.

58
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,054
But now, you just gotta go
a little bit farther.

59
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,656
But you're in the
right direction.

60
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:36,857
And that's gonna be the plunger

61
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,859
and your Cobra
skinny drain cleaner.

62
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,061
That's called acting.

63
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,564
It's kind of bringing
an intersectional lens

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,567
to the DIY space, where
if you can help the person

65
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,468
who's the most marginalized,

66
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,137
the person who's most affected
by the systems

67
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,872
that are oppressing,
then you're able

68
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,741
to kind of help
every single person.

69
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,212
But I am telling you right now,
you can wear jeans, overalls,

70
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,815
no bra, and do this work
and get a little dirty,

71
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,651
and have nail polish still,
and get a job done.

72
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,855
It doesn't matter.
[saw buzzing]

73
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,723
It's been a wild thing.

74
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,091
I mean, I wrote a book,

75
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,893
to become a number-one
<i>New York Times</i> bestselling book.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,596
I also do a podcast called
<i>The Handy Ma'am Hotline.</i>

77
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,731
I answer questions all the time.

78
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,399
Naturally want to come
and swing out.

79
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,667
Do you know what I mean?

80
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,203
I also raise money
for Point of Pride.

81
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,905
Point of Pride
is a nonprofit organization

82
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,673
that provides
gender-affirming care

83
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,510
for people who are not able
to access it.

84
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,545
- In unison: And share the live!

85
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:35,682
- In the last three years,
I've raised $4.5 million total.

86
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,518
It's a wild experience to be,
like,

87
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,119
you're strapped to a rocket

88
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,054
and you're just shooting off
into space.

89
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:45,459
And now here you are,
trying to figure this out.

90
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,229
[Mercury laughing]

91
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,899
I think the overarching theme
of all the work that I do

92
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,634
is about just taking up space.

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,469
It's about just being myself

94
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,971
and doing the things
that I care about.

95
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:02,142
Right now, trans people are the
center of every gosh darn topic.

96
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,680
We are 1% of the population, but
we're 95% of the conversation.

97
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,183
We're being talked about,
but never talked to.

98
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,118
Thank you for sharing
that story.

99
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,553
The world that I care about

100
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,189
is about providing services
to others.

101
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,391
Be it from providing
gender-affirming care

102
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,592
to people who can't access it.

103
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,993
[Mercury cheering]
- We just jumped up

104
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,628
to a million and five!
- What?

105
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,198
Being providing, you know,
home repair knowledge.

106
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,966
You already know how
to solve this problem

107
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,434
before you even start.

108
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,803
Be it just connecting
with people on a human level.

109
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,305
I enjoy those things.

110
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,575
I wanna let you know, you don't
have to shave your eyebrows off.

111
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,976
You know?
[laughing]

112
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,578
Am I gonna be here
in five years?

113
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,745
I don't know.

114
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,347
Am I gonna be here
in 10 years?

115
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,515
I don't know.

116
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,317
But I would love to be
the Betty White

117
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,685
of the maintenance world.
[laughing]

118
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:49,122
Live until I'm 105, fixing
drywall and making people smile.

119
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,290
That'd be great.

120
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,892
Have a good day, take care,
and remember,

121
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,127
you're worth the time it takes
to learn a new skill.

122
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,295
Buh-bye!

123
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,030
