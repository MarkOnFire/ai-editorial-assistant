1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,544
I knew I wanted to be military..

2
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,279
from a young age.

3
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,625
Every story is unbelievable.

4
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,128
Great, great, great,
great grandfather.

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,396
I'm sure we have...

6
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,965
reatives that fought
for the English.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,635
I don't have links on them yet.

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,435
Keywords is yet.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,171
I will find them.

10
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,509
He's not the greatest
president in the world.

11
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,477
But...

12
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,012
it's exciting for me
to be able to...

13
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,079
trace that lineage.

14
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,383
That I am related to
a US president.
