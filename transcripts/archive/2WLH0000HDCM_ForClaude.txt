00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,333
he was an incredibly talented
photographer.

467
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,999
Several years ago we discovered
a treasure trove of photos

468
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:25,125
that Luick took.

469
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,917
They'd been sitting
in a barn.

470
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:28,083
And this would be
the first time

471
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,250
anyone had eyes on those photos
in decades.

472

- Neil Howk:
Several hundred images.

473
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,333
Some of the images are from
the lighthouse on Sand Island

474
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,166
and what it was like
to be a lighthouse keeper.

475
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:44,834
- Bob Mackreth:
Excellent shots of the
lighthouse and the surroundings,

476
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,083

477

<i>He meticulously documented

482
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,291

He had a very good eye

483
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,542
for catching a personality.

484
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,999
And they are
so sharp and vivid.

485
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,208
<i>- Luick was able to evoke
 a sense of beauty</i>

495

definitely was an artist.

496

Life is not
all black and white.

497
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,375
There are
shades of gray.

500

- Neil Howk:
What is a lighthouse?

501
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,999
Well, on the one hand,
it's the light,

502
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,208
and it's all
of the aspects

503
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,959
that go into
keeping the light lit.

504
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,999
But it was also
a home.

505
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,250
People lived there.

506
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,375
- Linda Faust:
Our Great Lakes lighthouses,

507
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,875
most of them
were really family homes.

508
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,458
You can really see that

509
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,417

the lighthouse.

think, "Oh, it was a easy life,"

516
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,542
but it was
a difficult life.

517
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,959
The families
were actually farmers.

518
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,375
When you think about
growing your own food,

519
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,875
canning it, storing it,
and preparing it,

520
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,083

There's the cooking,
the cleaning, the sewing.

523
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It was constant work,
which amazes me.

524

- Linda Faust: People had to
survive and fight the elements.

525
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,500
All of those things
are true,

526
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,166
but not all of them
were in isolation.

Julia grew up

776
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:14,875
- Ken Wardius:
Wind Point really is
a gorgeous work of art.

777
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,999
- Barb Wardius:
It's strong, it's majestic.

778
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,999
It's very graceful.

779

It's just
simply beautiful.

780
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,999
- Michael Gasperi: Pretty much
the definition of picturesque,

781
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:28,625
Wind Point Lighthouse.

782
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,667
<i>- Built in 1880,</i>

783
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:33,792
<i>Wind Point's
 architectural design</i>

784
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,458
<i>is known
 as the Poe-style lighthouse.</i>

785
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:40,792
<i>A style attributed
to Orlando Metcalfe Poe,</i>

786
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,125
<i>a veteran of the Civil War</i>

787
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,999
<i>who served
 under General William Sherman.</i>

788
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:46,999
<i>After the war,</i>

789
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,250
<i>Poe was the Chief Engineer</i>

790
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,542
<i>of the Upper Great Lakes
 Lighthouse District</i>

791
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,875
<i>and oversaw the construction</i>

792
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,667
<i>of numerous beacons
 along the Great Lakes.</i>

793
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,583
- Michael Gasperi:
What Poe really brought was

794
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:02,417
a much more substantial,
brighter, taller structure

795
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,041
than what
had been here before.

796
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,250
<i>- The soaring tower
 at Wind Point</i>

797
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,959
<i>is indicative
 of Poe-style lighthouses,</i>

798
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:11,999
<i>which are recognizable</i>

799
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,291
<i>by their
 distinct cylinder shapes.</i>

800
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:18,000
- Michael Gasperi:
The base is about
twice as big as the top.

801
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,917
And it has
just the right taper

802
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:24,166
to really make
a hundred-foot tower look right.

[playful, dreamy melody]

804
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,041
- Barb Wardius:
At Wind Point,

805
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,208
you can stand at the base
and look up,

806
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,999
and it just seems
to go on<i>forever!</i>

807
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:34,083
<i>- Near the top
 of the tower,</i>

808
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:38,083

the Florentine-inspired
 Italianate style.</i>

811
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,250
- Michael Gasperi:
They could have just been

812
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,999
straight pieces
of triangle,

813
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:51,917
but they're
actually slightly shaped.

814
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:53,750
It's unexpectedly simple,

815
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:59,542
but yet it's beautiful
and it has an elegance to it.

816

<i>post-Civil War.</i>

820
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,875
- Barb Wardius:
The time that Wind Point

821
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:14,750
was built in the 1880s
and put into service

822
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,959
was a boom time
for Wisconsin.

823
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,999
- Brendon Baillod:
On the Great Lakes,

824
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:21,750
there were more vessels
per square mile

825
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,208
than any place else
in the world.

826
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:27,250
<i>- Lake Michigan
 was filled with steamships</i>

827
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,709
<i>and enormous
 straight-deck freighters.</i>

828
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,999
<i>They were overflowing
 with a new export:</i>

829
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,041
<i>grain.</i>

830
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,667
- Brendon Baillod:
"Prairie Gold,"
as they called it.

831
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,625
That was
where the money was.

832
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:42,291
Almost all grain that was
being consumed on the East Coast

833
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,750
was coming
out of Wisconsin.

834
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,125
Lighthouses were just essential
to protect those investments.

835
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:51,999
<i>- Wind Point was chosen
 for its strategic location</i>

836
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:54,999
<i>between
 Milwaukee and Chicago.</i>

837
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,000
<i>The rapidly developing region</i>

838
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,625
<i>was attracting
more than just commerce.</i>

839
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:03,125
<i>It was welcoming
scores of new residents.</i>

840
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,542
- Brendon Baillod:
Lake Michigan
was an early target

841
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,166
for immigrants
from Europe.

842
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,959
- Albert Muchka:
You had ships full of immigrants

843
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,999
coming from
Buffalo, New York.

844
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:15,125
They arrived on
paddlewheel ships and steamers.

845
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,500
You know, the immigrant story
of the late 19th century.

846
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,417
They would come
to Wisconsin.

847
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,667
<i>- Seeking
freedom and opportunity,</i>

848
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,291
<i>the journey to Wisconsin

849
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,375
<i>After a harrowing trip
 across the Atlantic,</i>

850
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,041
<i>many immigrants

851

<i>the crowded and dangerous
 Great Lakes.</i>

852
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,792

With that volume
of vessel density,

853
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:38,875
you're going
to have accidents.

854
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,542
- Ted Karamanski:
Some ships didn't make it.

855
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,375
<i>- Ships like
 the</i>Phoenix,

856
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:47,333
<i>considered one of the worst

<i>But for the many immigrants

862
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:04,250
<i>a lighthouse meant reassurance
 in a new land.</i>

863
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,834

The lighthouse was
that feeling of safety.

[uplifting piano]

865
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,083
- Ted Karamanski:
When you saw the lighthouse

866
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,417
at Manitowoc or Sheboygan,

867
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:17,041
you had reached
your destination,

868
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,999
and there had to be
a sigh of relief.

869
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:23,083
- Albert Muchka: The idea
that the ship captain

870
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:23,999
knew where he was going.

871
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:26,834
In a storm,
you knew there was land here.

872
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:30,166
And as an immigrant coming in
on one of those boats,

873
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,999
being afraid and having
the crews then tell you,

"Don't worry,

North Point Lighthouse

a compilation

896
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:34,999
of parts
of three different lighthouses.

897
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:38,291
<i>- Originally constructed

900
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:48,500
<i>In 1888, a new cast-iron tower
</i>nwas built a hundred feet inland,

901
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,792
Nwith the lantern of the original
<i>lighthouse placed on top.</i>

902
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:55,333
<i>But by the turn
 of the 20th century,</i>

903

<i>North Point

904

- Mark Kuehn: What do you do
when you design a park?

905
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,000
You plant trees.

906
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,625
Well, by 1911,
the treeline's too high.

907
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,667
You can't see

908
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,750
<i>- The solution

912
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:16,542

If you look at

at North Point today,

914
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,917
there's actually
a seam in the middle

915
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,542
that differentiates
the new base,

916
