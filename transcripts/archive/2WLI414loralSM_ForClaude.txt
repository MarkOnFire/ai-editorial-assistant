how unique flowers are.

00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:16,583
These look like
little, like, Peeps to me.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,083
They're very just fuzzy.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,250
There's just so many
different varieties.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,083
They're all just so special
in their own way.

and lead florist of 414loral.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,999
So, we've got in
some Anthurium.

11
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,500
This is one
of my absolute favorite flowers.

12
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,999
I love
the different textures.

I love
the different aromas.

Okay, so we've got sweet pea,

15
00:00:55,125 --> 00:01:01,709
and we love this
because of how whimsical it is.

[wrap crinkling]

When I'm arranging, I really
like to take note of that;

18
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,667
how each flower
plays its role

19

in making the overall

with some linear flowers

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,250
to give it some height.

23

Just the way that I feel
when I'm in the shop

and here, in general,

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,999
I feel like this space
has a lot of really good energy

26
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,625
and that's something
that I want to share

with the community.

So, when this space
opened up,

00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:50,999
it kind of seemed like a no-

especially with it being
so close to the old shop.

It was known for being a hub
for Black entrepreneurship

36
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,375
and that's something
that's so special

the organization

63
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,375
as a way to show Black men
alternative ways to heal.

And his intention
for creating this event

was to show men that

you deserve flowers, too.

Brought two different varieties.

it's different textures.
