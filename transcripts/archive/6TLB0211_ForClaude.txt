1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,470
[electronic music]

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,272
- Sergio González: Oh, Kacie,
did you hear about

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,440
the new shipwreck?

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,041
They just found it
off of Lake Michigan.

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,376
- Kacie Lucchini Butcher: No!

6
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,645
- Yeah, it was carrying a bunch
of golden ducats.

7
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:12,813
- Ooh!
- Sergio: Yeah!

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,816
- Executive: [muffled scolding]

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,552
- Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,354
We have to wear suits
all the time now?

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,356
Th-Th-That's so unreasonable!

12
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,224
- They're so...
- Boring.

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,059
- I was gonna say ugly,
but that too.

14
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,294
- What's next, Kacie?

15
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,796
No colorful socks,
no purple hair?

16
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,132
- But my hair grows this way.

17
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,901
It does!
- Anyways,

18
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,236
we have to figure something out.

19
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,504
- Well, what do you propose?

20
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,672
You heard him.

21
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,274
He barely let us get a word in.

22
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,277
He said it was the new rule.
- Hmm.

23
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,345
What if we talked to somebody

24
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,548
who knows a little something
about protesting,

25
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,383
about making your voice heard?

26
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,817
- Now, I like what
you're thinking.

27
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,688
Let's ditch these suits and go.
- All right, let's go.

28
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,490
- Hi, Stu!
- Stu Levitan: Oh, hi, Kacie!

29
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,891
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

30
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,294
- So I called you because
we have a bunch of questions

31
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,129
about protests on campus
in Madison,

32
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,331
but also in Wisconsin,
and I knew you were the guy.

33
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,499
- I'm happy to help.

34
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,701
- So why did you tell us
to meet you here?

35
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,204
- Well, because Bascom Hill
is one of the ground zeros

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,540
for all of the protest activity
that happened during the 1960s.

37
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,943
- Can you give us a sense
of what was going on

38
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,177
in the 1960s?

39
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,579
- In terms of protests,

40
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,615
the first protests of the '60s
were civil rights protests.

41
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,116
And they were very polite
and orderly.

42
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,852
There were people picketing.

43
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,721
There was a movement
in the South

44
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,290
to stop the
five and dime stores,

45
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,992
the Woolworth's and Kresge's,

46
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,962
that were discriminating
against Black patrons

47
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,130
and wouldn't let them sit
at the lunch counters.

48
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,299
So there was a series
of demonstrations,

49
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,469
and the same month that
that started in Tennessee,

50
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,072
there were people in Madison
picketing the Woolworth's

51
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,908
on the Square, just marching
around with pickets.

52
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,644
And that kind of just
gentle picketing

53
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,615
continued for a couple of years,
and by the mid-1960s,

54
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,619
you got a whole new generation
of protesters.

55
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,389
- The 1960s were a time
of tremendous social change.

56
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,292
Young people in particular
played a huge role

57
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,094
in pushing for change
in the United States.

58
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,930
Young people also participated
in the civil rights movement,

59
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,199
which fought for equal rights
for all people,

60
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,667
regardless of their race.

61
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,269
They supported protests
for women's rights

62
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,337
that worked to give women
more opportunities

63
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,306
for work and education.

64
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,608
They also protested
in support of gay rights

65
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,377
and efforts
to increase awareness

66
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,012
around environmental issues.

67
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,382
These protests mattered and led
to important legislation

68
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,050
like the Civil Rights Act.

69
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,720
All of this to say that the
1960s are rightfully remembered

70
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,890
as a decade where young people
fought for change.

71
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,493
- So, you had these
more polite protests

72
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,495
that are happening
through the early 1960s.

73
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,431
What begins to shift
in the middle of that decade?

74
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,933
- The war.

75
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:51,605
1965 is when Vietnam supplants
civil rights as <i>the</i> main issue.

76
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,976
President Johnson starts bombing
Vietnam in February 1965,

77
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,012
and that creates a whole new
generation of protest.

78
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,082
And then you turn
from polite protest

79
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,018
to some level of disruption.

80
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,522
- The Vietnam War was a conflict
from 1955 to 1975

81
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,792
between communist North Vietnam
and non-communist South Vietnam.

82
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,560
It was fought
during the Cold War,

83
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,562
an international clash
between the United States

84
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,030
and the Soviet Union.

85
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,433
The U.S. joined the Vietnam War
in an effort to stop communism

86
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,201
from spreading
in southeast Asia.

87
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,938
The conflict, however, proved
long, costly, and deadly.

88
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,041
Many Americans questioned why
their country was involved,

89
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,244
especially as they watched
the death and destruction

90
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,479
caused by battles every night
on their television.

91
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,015
Antiwar protests grew
in the 1960s,

92
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,118
led by students, activists,
and even veterans.

93
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,721
The biggest protest was held
in 1969,

94
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,489
when hundreds of thousands
of Americans gathered

95
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,458
in Washington, D.C.

96
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,860
- After nearly 20 years
of conflict,

97
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:51,765
the war finally ended in 1975
with North Vietnam's victory.

98
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,202
Many soldiers died, and the U.S.
faced deep divisions

99
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,171
for years afterwards.

100
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,573
The protests around the war
changed America,

101
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,675
showing how citizens
could speak out

102
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,644
against the role of the
U.S. military abroad

103
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,648
and influence how our government
makes decisions.

104
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,084
- The Vietnam protest era
in Madison, on this campus,

105
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:15,155
started on October 18, 1963
with 350 people

106
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,959
holding pickets
in a little polite rally

107
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,994
in front of the Memorial Union.

108
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,965
In October 1969, there were
15,000 people

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,734
in the Field House.
- Kacie: Wow.

110
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,469
- 15,000 people.

111
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,338
And then they all marched up
State Street

112
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,807
and had a candlelight service.

113
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,943
They were holding candles,
it was raining.

114
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,512
They had candles
under their umbrellas,

115
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,515
and they all had the names
of a Wisconsin serviceman

116
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,050
who had died in the war.

117
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,220
And the bell of
Grace Episcopal Church tolled,

118
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,456
and each time the bell tolled,
they extinguished a candle.

119
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,659
- Kacie: Wow.
- 350 people to 15,000

120
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,595
in the space of six years.
- Sergio: Wow.

121
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,563
- Every year that
the war went on,

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,167
more and more people went
from either pro-war

123
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,436
or "It's not relevant to me,"

124
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,837
to "I'm starting
to get concerned,"

125
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,840
to "Oh, I gotta march," or
"Oh, this is really serious."

126
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,843
I mean, every year, it just
ticked up and up and up.

127
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,979
- Can you talk about what
students were seeing

128
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,047
and what they didn't like
about the Vietnam War?

129
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,250
- Well, the first thing they
didn't like about the war

130
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,652
was that if they were a young
man, they could be drafted

131
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,153
and sent to Vietnam.

132
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,822
- Military conscription
is the practice

133
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,857
of requiring United States
citizens

134
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,425
to serve in the military.

135
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,628
It is informally called
"the draft"

136
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,097
because men were drafted
into service.

137
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,832
From 1940 to 1973,

138
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,201
the draft was used
during peacetime

139
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,236
and during times of conflict

140
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,438
to fill vacancies
in the armed forces.

141
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,608
However, not everyone was okay
with this practice.

142
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,777
When the United States
entered World War II,

143
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,580
some men became
"conscientious objectors,"

144
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,882
meaning they wouldn't serve
in the military.

145
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,217
During the Vietnam War,

146
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,753
resistance to the draft
reached its peak.

147
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,522
During this period, men who
refused to be drafted

148
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,457
were called "draft dodgers."

149
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,093
These men refused to sign up
for conscription

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,095
and some even left the country--

151
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:06,099
actions which could result
in steep fines or even jail.

152
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,901
- They were afraid of being sent
to Vietnam,

153
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,138
they opposed the war
on philosophical grounds,

154
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,107
and they saw it every night
on their television.

155
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,643
From 1965, '66, '67 and on,

156
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:21,915
you saw the Vietnam War live and
in color in your living room.

157
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,083
- Wow.
- Yeah.

158
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,485
- And it really radicalized
a whole generation,

159
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,454
and it frightened
a whole generation.

160
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,624
That's what most of the people
were protesting.

161
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,025
- Where have you brought me now?

162
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,627
- I brought you
to the UW Archives.

163
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,795
- Cat Phan: Hey, guys.

164
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,797
- Sergio: Oh, Cat,
what are you doing here?

165
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,299
- I work here, Sergio.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

166
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,401
- Well, welcome to the
University Archives.

167
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,669
We collect, preserve,

168
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,105
and make accessible materials
about the university.

169
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,708
So, Kacie said you were coming,
so I pulled a bunch of stuff,

170
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,377
and here's the last poster
you asked for.

171
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,179
- Thank you, I've been looking
for this one.

172
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,780
- Sergio: Cat,
what are we looking at?

173
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,583
Can you give us a little bit
of a rundown on what we see?

174
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,019
- Cat: Kacie asked for posters
about the Vietnam-era protests,

175
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,022
and I pulled a selection
of items for you to look at.

176
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,490
- Now, when you say a selection,

177
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,692
you're saying there's more than
what you just have right here?

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,960
- Oh, yes.

179
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,962
This is just a tiny fraction
of what we've collected.

180
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,964
- I really wanted us to come
to the archives

181
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,499
to see this poster specifically.

182
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,401
Because we were talking with Stu
about the draft

183
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,370
and about all the anti-Vietnam
sentiment,

184
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,372
and I thought this poster
was a really good example

185
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,908
of the types of conversations
that people were having,

186
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,678
and how you can use a poster as
a way to learn about the past.

187
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,181
So at the top, it says,
"Dump the Draft," right,

188
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,982
and it's in the shape
of an American flag,

189
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,150
which you have to anticipate,

190
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,152
you see this
and it kind of draws you in.

191
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,754
And there's a bunch of
questions, right?

192
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,922
"Should we repeal it?"

193
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,557
"Should it be a volunteer army?"

194
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,958
"Should we do conscription?"

195
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,626
"Is it a two-year extension?"

196
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,528
You can see that people
were having conversations

197
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,930
about what to do with the draft,

198
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,432
and maybe people disagreed
about that, right?

199
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,034
- And the fact that you're
saying conversation,

200
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,435
you're saying there must be
another perspective.

201
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,037
And here, I'm thinking about
another poster here

202
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,471
that Cat's brought us.

203
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,874
This is probably one that a lot
of people are familiar with.

204
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,876
It's Uncle Sam pointing
at someone

205
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,244
and saying, "I want you," right?

206
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,346
And so here you have
what that is,

207
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,415
in conversation with what it's
responding to.

208
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,016
- What's interesting for me
to think about

209
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,687
is students are posting posters
up in high-traffic areas,

210
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,956
and what if they put these
posters next to each other?

211
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,992
What would students think
of a poster that said,

212
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,729
"I want you to join the Army,
this is a positive thing,"

213
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,398
versus the conversation that is
happening with the draft poster

214
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,033
that Kacie talked about.

215
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,069
- And that's what these posters
are supposed to do.

216
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,837
They draw people
into the conversation

217
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,405
to be a part of that discussion.

218
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,374
- Yeah, and then also
us historians today,

219
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,044
we can learn so much from just
one little piece of paper.

220
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,614
- All right, a visit with Stu,
a trip to the archives,

221
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,415
I think we have all the tools
we need.

222
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,217
- All right, let's get
to making these posters,

223
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,819
and we'll make our voices heard.

224
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,954
- Protests have a long history
in the United States.

225
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,956
Our country's start
can literally be traced back

226
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,124
to an act of protest.

227
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,359
For over two centuries,

228
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,794
protests, whether
through marches, speeches,

229
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,230
or social media have helped
shape the country

230
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,567
by pushing for equality,
justice, and change.

231
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:57,671
They're a crucial part
of civic life in a democracy.

232
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,740
- Are there issues that are
important to you?

233
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,708
Talk to your friends
and classmates

234
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,844
and see if they care
about those issues too.

235
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,713
Together, you can all talk about
how to bring more awareness

236
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,881
to your cause.

237
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,584
You might decide to make
your own protest posters.

238
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,752
Don't be shy.

239
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,187
Your voice matters!

240
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,622
All you need is some big paper,
some art supplies,

241
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,625
and an issue that matters
to you.

242
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,929
What do you think?
- That's not bad.

243
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,931
- But I've also heard them
called skirmishes,

244
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,432
protests, riot.

245
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,835
Where do those kind of labels
get put on,

246
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,002
and how do those work?

247
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,538
- Well, they get put on
by people like me.

248
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,607
- By the historians.
- By the historians, yeah.

249
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,609
You have to trust that
the historian is accurate

250
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:39,813
in saying, "Okay, so here's
what happened."
