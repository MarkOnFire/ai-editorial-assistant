1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,904
- Welcome, everyone,

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,774
and thank you for joining us for
today's "History Sandwiched In."

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,076
My name is Jenny Pederson,

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,777
and I am the
public programs manager

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,181
for the Wisconsin
Historical Society.

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,682
I also want to take a moment

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,685
to thank Wisconsin
Historical Society Press

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,787
for their support in identifying

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,425
and suggesting authors and
titles for this program series.

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,295
And we also have a big thank you
to PBS Wisconsin,

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,998
who is here today to record
and stream,

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,667
with Jeff's permission,
his lecture

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,802
and include it
in <i>University Place</i> programming,

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,539
which will be available
on PBS Wisconsin channels

15
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,340
as well as online.

16
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,376
A couple notes about that.

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,746
If you are to look for future--
for this program in the future,

18
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,681
you will find it
under a program titled

19
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,186
"Wisconsin African Americans
in the Civil War."

20
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,388
Now I officially transition
into our welcome.

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,423
So, I do want to say
thank you again

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,494
and a big welcome to you all
for coming to today's program.

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,963
A quick note
that opinions expressed today

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,464
are those of the presenter

25
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,267
and are not necessarily those of
the Wisconsin Historical Society

26
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,736
or the society's employees.

27
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,740
And now for who you are
all here today to see.

28
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:18,145
It is a pleasure to welcome
author, educator, and historian

29
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,880
Jeff Kannel.

30
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,482
- Jeff Correct.
- Yes!

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,650
[Jeff chuckles]

32
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,587
We did a little session
on pronunciations before.

33
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,589
Who is presenting
"Make Way for Liberty:

34
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,391
Wisconsin African Americans
in the Civil War."

35
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,826
Jeff's presentation today

36
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,095
is based on his book
of the same name,

37
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,797
as seen up here,

38
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,867
which was originally published
in October 2020

39
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,603
through the Wisconsin
Historical Society Press,

40
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,906
and is the winner
of the 2021 Book of Merit Award

41
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,541
from the Board of Curators,

42
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,977
Wisconsin Historical
Society Press.

43
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,845
Before we hand over
the microphone,

44
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,516
I am excited to share a brief
biography of our speaker.

45
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,319
Jeff Kannel is a retired
physical therapist and educator.

46
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,756
He was a tour guide at the
Civil War Museum in Kenosha

47
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,491
from 2011 to 2018.

48
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,795
He has spoken about African
American Civil War soldiers

49
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,999
in more than two dozen towns
around the state.

50
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,800
In addition
to <i>Make Way for Liberty,</i>

51
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,771
Jeff is also co-author,
with Victoria Tashjian,

52
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,041
of "Henry Sink:
Settler, Soldier, Citizen"

53
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,678
for the <i>Wisconsin Magazine</i>
<i>of History</i> in 2018.

54
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,547
Please join me
in welcoming Jeff,

55
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,949
and enjoy the presentation.

56
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,251
[audience applauding]

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,295
- All right,
well, thank you all for coming,

58
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,763
and thanks
to the Historical Society

59
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,732
for inviting me to appear here.

60
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,637
The history and the stories
of the African Americans

61
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,540
who served in the Civil War
on the Union side

62
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:58,345
have unfortunately
been forgotten and nearly erased

63
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,048
until the last few decades.

64
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,151
I started doing research
on these men

65
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,886
about 14 years ago

66
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,289
while I was working as a tour
guide at the museum in Kenosha.

67
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,592
I met a group of reenactors
from Milwaukee

68
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,428
who were representing Company F

69
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,930
of the 29th
U.S. Colored Infantry,

70
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,033
and I was embarrassed
to admit to them

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,769
that I didn't know anything
about Black men serving

72
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,172
from Wisconsin in the Civil War.

73
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,741
So I started doing research
on that company,

74
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,811
and, just, it spread out
from there.

75
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,546
This is a history

76
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,984
that really needs to be
brought back in,

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,186
brought back to light,

78
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,290
to fill out this history
of our state and country.

79
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,527
And I'm glad
to have had the opportunity

80
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,262
to put this book together

81
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,264
and to put these presentations
together.

82
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,034
These men
were true freedom fighters.

83
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:59,072
Today, I'll be introducing you
to seven of the men,

84
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,809
over 700 men, who served
from Wisconsin

85
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,382
in the Civil War,
African American men.

86
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,118
Six of these men
appear on the covers,

87
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,754
front and back covers,
of the book.

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,192
And the seventh one,
I'll start with first,

89
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,828
is a man by the name
of Oscar McClellan.

90
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,599
And I include him
for three reasons.

91
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,903
First, the stories
he told of his enslavement

92
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,273
need to be remembered.

93
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,643
He was born enslaved
in Virginia.

94
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,748
At age 14, he was sold away
from his parents to Kentucky

95
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,151
and never saw them again.

96
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,621
In Kentucky,
at age 26, he married.

97
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,624
Again, it was a marriage
during slavery,

98
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,360
so not one legally recognized.

99
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,230
But he married, they had a son.

100
00:04:56,597 --> 00:05:01,235
When the son turned 14,
he was sold away from them.

101
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,837
And shortly after the son
was taken away,

102
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,372
his wife died.

103
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,975
So, this man, while enslaved,

104
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,945
had his family
ripped away from him twice.

105
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,784
In 1862, when the war began,
he saw a chance to escape

106
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:25,559
when the 13th Wisconsin Infantry
came near to where he worked.

107
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,761
He escaped to them,
worked with them for a while,

108
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,565
and returned to Wisconsin with
them when they were furloughed.

109
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:36,970
So he came back to Sharon,
a small town in Walworth County.

110
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:41,275
Now, here's the second reason
I wanted to talk about him.

111
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,278
He enlisted in Marengo,
Illinois.

112
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,579
So, he was in Wisconsin.

113
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,748
Why'd he enlist
in Marengo, Illinois?

114
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,852
Well, when Lincoln signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

115
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,391
part two of that was he finally
opened the state militias

116
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,127
and the federal army
to Black men.

117
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,164
Prior to that,
they were not allowed to join.

118
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,799
With the Emancipation
Proclamation,

119
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,501
the U.S. Colored Troops
were formed.

120
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:11,038
States started recruiting
and accepting Black volunteers,

121
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,940
but not Wisconsin.

122
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,808
For all of 1863, no.

123
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,578
Into 1864, no.

124
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,513
So, Wisconsin was,

125
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,282
a lot of these men knew, "Well,
Wisconsin isn't taking us in,"

126
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:26,353
so men started leaving the state
to volunteer.

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,422
And when those numbers
started going up and up,

128
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,557
"Well, I guess we'll start
recruiting them.

129
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,359
We'll accept them
as volunteers."

130
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:35,729
So he enlisted, actually,
in August of 1864,

131
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,565
after Wisconsin began
accepting volunteers,

132
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,002
so I'm not sure if he
just made that decision

133
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,638
because he assumed Wisconsin
still wasn't accepting them

134
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:48,642
or because Marengo was closer
than Madison, which it was.

135
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,979
So he was assigned to the
29th U.S. Colored Infantry,

136
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,616
which you'll hear about
a lot today, Company D.

137
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,653
He was present
at the final battle in Virginia,

138
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,056
where Lee's army surrendered
at Appomattox,

139
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,393
and I'll talk about that
a lot more later.

140
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,596
He returned to Sharon,
returned to Walworth County,

141
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,099
ended up living in Delavan,

142
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,934
where he worked
as a farm laborer.

143
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:18,739
He married again,
but they never had children.

144
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,207
He worked as a farm laborer,

145
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,944
and, together, he and his wife
had a large vegetable garden,

146
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,914
which they supplemented
his farm income

147
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,151
by selling produce
during the summer months.

148
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,156
The third point
I wanted to make about this man,

149
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,959
again, as a representative
of a lot of the veterans,

150
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,696
is he was the founder,
donor of the land,

151
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,433
and one of the primary builders

152
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,138
of the Delavan African Methodist
Episcopal Church,

153
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,675
which is still a functioning
congregation, by the way.

154
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,677
The church was built
right next to their house

155
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,179
on land that he donated.

156
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,648
This picture is the
only known picture of him,

157
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,451
and it was probably taken
during the construction.

158
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,653
It's from a newspaper.

159
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,923
The construction was
in 1896-97.

160
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,658
He died in 1898.

161
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,696
Oscar McClellan received
an invalid pension

162
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,898
for his disabilities,

163
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,367
I believe his
was old age, though,

164
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,569
from his service time.

165
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,139
He was a member
of the local GAR post.

166
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,276
GAR was the Grand Army
of the Republic,

167
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,447
which was the organization of
Union Veterans of the Civil War,

168
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,682
and I'll talk more about that
later, too.

169
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,319
So, he's the one
who is not on the cover.

170
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:44,091
Now we'll go on
to the people on the cover.

171
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,059
John J. Valentine

172
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,729
was born in Stokes County,
North Carolina,

173
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,897
in 1821.

174
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,632
He was born free.

175
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,302
Now, he was born
in North Carolina, right?

176
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,404
But in that part
of North Carolina

177
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,406
and the adjoining part
of Virginia,

178
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,675
there were significant numbers
of free Blacks

179
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,511
in those years, in the 1820s.

180
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,914
Something happened in 1830
to change that,

181
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,750
and that was
Nat Turner's rebellion,

182
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,652
which took place in that area,

183
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:16,356
and it was no longer possible
for those families

184
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,594
to stay as free Black citizens
in that area,

185
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:24,398
so almost all of them
moved on to somewhere else.

186
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,234
A number of the other servicemen
from Wisconsin

187
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,569
also had that history

188
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,271
of coming from that area
of North Carolina and Virginia.

189
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,273
But the families left

190
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,277
after Nat Turner's rebellion
was crushed.

191
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,647
So the Valentine family
moved to Ohio,

192
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,851
and in Ohio,
John married Louisa,

193
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,621
and in 1847, the entire family

194
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,757
and the entire family
of his uncle and aunt

195
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,726
moved to Wisconsin.

196
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,328
All of them were farmers,

197
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,196
with the exception
of John and Louisa,

198
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,198
who moved to Janesville,

199
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,603
and he was a cook
in a restaurant in Janesville.

200
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,076
Now, at age 42,
in January of 1865,

201
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,680
late in the war, he enlisted.

202
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,283
He was in the 17th
U.S. Colored Infantry.

203
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,255
There were 17 men from Wisconsin
who were in that regiment,

204
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,324
and their age spread
kind of reflects the problem

205
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,528
that the Union had
in recruiting.

206
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,898
Seven of the men
were 35 or over.

207
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,966
Two of the men were 16.

208
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:38,138
So, again, if you think about
that, look at that,

209
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,340
think about the fact that,
at the end of the war,

210
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,743
10% of the men in uniform,

211
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,245
in the blue uniforms
of the Union,

212
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,580
were African American.

213
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,815
What if they had not opened
the army to them?

214
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:53,320
Where would the Union have been
without their service?

215
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:57,958
Now, besides John Valentine,
his brother Julius

216
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,727
left Wisconsin
earlier in the war,

217
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:04,698
went to Illinois, and served
in the 29th Colored Infantry,

218
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,634
which was formed in Illinois.

219
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,404
His brother-in-law,
William McGraw,

220
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,040
served with him in the 17th.

221
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,843
His nephew John served as a cook

222
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,312
with the 39th
Wisconsin Infantry,

223
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,047
and another nephew, Shadrach,

224
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:24,017
left the state,
volunteered in Michigan,

225
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,454
served in the 102nd
U.S. Colored Infantry,

226
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,457
and died from disease
while in service.

227
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:34,328
He's buried
at Arlington National Cemetery,

228
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:38,498
which some of you may know
is on land that belonged

229
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,934
to General Robert E. Lee
of the Confederacy

230
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,736
prior to the war.

231
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,606
So, his plantation was seized

232
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,410
and became the the center of
the Arlington National Cemetery.

233
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,913
From the very beginning
of that cemetery,

234
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,985
both Black and white servicemen
who died were buried,

235
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,855
and several other Wisconsin men
were buried,

236
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,058
Black men were buried,
at Arlington.

237
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,961
Now, Valentine served one year.

238
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:12,499
He did garrison duty at forts
around Nashville.

239
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,536
He returned to Wisconsin,

240
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,437
came back to Janesville
initially,

241
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,340
and he and his brother-in-law
were hotel cooks again.

242
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,043
They moved to Milton,
did the same kind of work,

243
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,711
and then moved to Waukesha.

244
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,613
Now, in Waukesha,

245
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,251
John Valentine became the owner
of a restaurant, confectionery,

246
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,519
and, later on,

247
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,589
added a hotel business
to his location.

248
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:39,459
He was a successful businessman,
and appears in many ways

249
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:44,498
to have been very widely
respected in that community.

250
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,301
He was a GAR member,
and I'm gonna talk about that

251
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,869
a little bit here now.

252
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,871
The GAR,
the veterans organization,

253
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:55,843
was open to any honorably
discharged Union veteran.

254
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,680
The other condition was

255
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,748
their membership application
had to be accepted

256
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,619
by a vote of the members
of the local post.

257
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,056
As I was doing the research
on this,

258
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,393
it surprised me how many
of these men were members

259
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,730
of predominantly white GAR posts
in Wisconsin.

260
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:17,898
So I thought about it.

261
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,499
Well, in most of those cases,

262
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,336
they would have been the only
Black member of the post,

263
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,904
although there was a post
in Madison

264
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,040
that had at least five
Black members at one point.

265
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,010
But, again, it reflects the fact

266
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:34,181
that these guys were respected
to some degree

267
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,217
for their service
in the Civil War.

268
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,856
Notice also on his vest
the ribbons and medals.

269
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,893
Those are GAR medals.

270
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,663
And you'll see those on
a number of the other men, too.

271
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,067
Four of the six men on the cover
were members of the GAR,

272
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:58,805
and I believe almost all
of them have the medals on,

273
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:03,343
and I'll explain why that was
a little bit later.

274
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,681
Now, John Valentine also
received an old-age pension,

275
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,550
and, late in life--

276
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,453
I want to talk a little bit
about Charles Henry Taylor.

277
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,490
He was a veteran,
also of company D

278
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,425
of the 29th
U.S. Colored Infantry.

279
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,060
He served with Oscar McClellan,

280
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,963
the first soldier
we talked about.

281
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,700
He lived in Madison,
a few blocks from here.

282
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,435
In the 1880s,

283
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,139
he was getting an invalid
pension because of disability.

284
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:37,544
He also became unable to take
care of his own finances,

285
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,380
so he had a guardian
appointed for him.

286
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,950
There were problems
with that guardian.

287
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,952
He petitioned for a new one,

288
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,888
and his new guardian
became John Valentine,

289
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:50,290
a veteran, another veteran.

290
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,292
And in the last year and a half
he lived,

291
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:56,096
he went and lived with the
Valentine family in Waukesha,

292
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,632
and he's buried
in Prairie Home Cemetery

293
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,367
in Waukesha.

294
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:01,969
I mention this

295
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,471
because this will come up
with every one of these men

296
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,507
we've talked about.

297
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,943
In doing original,
a lot of the reading originally

298
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,612
on U.S. colored troops

299
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,881
and general histories
of the Civil War,

300
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,782
it was stated that, well,

301
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,819
the Black soldiers didn't stay
in touch with each other

302
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,788
because they didn't write
regimental histories

303
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,658
and they didn't have reunions

304
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,995
and they didn't have
regimental associations.

305
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,297
But as we look
through what these guys did,

306
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,299
they were tied to each other,

307
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,102
and it had nothing to do with
what regiment they were in

308
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,771
or what company they were in
or even where they lived.

309
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,541
They were tied to each other
because of their service.

310
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,075
When they moved,
they moved to places

311
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,911
where other veterans were.

312
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,913
When they were in trouble,
they went to each other.

313
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,247
They supported each other.

314
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,483
So, I think
that looking at the history

315
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,418
of the Wisconsin veterans,

316
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:55,956
that kind of general statement
is really not true.

317
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:59,059
They were
very connected to each other

318
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,929
and supportive of each other.

319
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,333
Next one is Thomas Greene.

320
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:11,104
He was enslaved in Missouri
and escaped.

321
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,141
He had an unusual escape.

322
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,445
He was one of the only people
who escaped enslavement

323
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,348
on the Overground Railroad.

324
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,250
He had a different relationship
with his owner

325
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,685
from Oscar McClellan

326
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,955
in that when he was done
with the work demanded of him

327
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,356
by his owner,

328
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:32,226
he worked out, but was allowed
to keep the money he earned.

329
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,729
So he saved,
over a long period of time,

330
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:39,800
enough money to come
to Wisconsin by train.

331
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:45,472
On the trip, he came with
an extended group of people.

332
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,307
When they arrived here,

333
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,176
they discovered
that everything in their trunks

334
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,912
had been stolen
while it was on the train.

335
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,413
So, they had some money left,

336
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,616
but all of their clothes
and all of their other property

337
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,551
had been stolen from them.

338
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,220
He ended up in Grant County

339
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,122
in a community
named Pleasant Ridge,

340
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,326
which was a hilltop
Black farming community

341
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:11,698
almost entirely made up
of formerly enslaved people.

342
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:14,301
This is different from the
Cheyenne Valley community,

343
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,670
two counties north,
in Vernon County,

344
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,572
where many of the people
there--

345
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,508
First of all,
it was a multiracial settlement,

346
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:26,513
and, secondly, many of the
people in that community

347
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,549
had been born free.

348
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,217
There were some
formerly enslaved people there,

349
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,119
but most of the founders

350
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,322
of the Vernon County,
Cheyenne Valley, settlement,

351
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,057
were born free.

352
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,563
Now, Pleasant Ridge
in Grant County

353
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:47,034
was about 30 miles
from Prairie du Chien.

354
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,735
In October of 1864,

355
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,637
Thomas Greene walked
those 30 miles

356
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:53,173
to volunteer for the army.

357
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,743
He was sent to Madison
to Camp Randall,

358
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,348
which was where all the
volunteers after June of 1864,

359
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,317
all the volunteers,
Black or white,

360
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,353
went to Madison
for initial training.

361
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,990
And then people like Valentine
or Thomas Greene

362
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,059
and the other men
I'm gonna talk about

363
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,328
were sent from there
to St. Louis,

364
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:19,266
where they were assigned
to a company and a regiment.

365
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,468
His unit served a year,

366
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,672
and, again,
they did garrison duties,

367
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:30,310
manning forts in various
locations in Kentucky.

368
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:36,149
When he came back,
he married Hattie Shepard,

369
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,753
who was also from the
Pleasant Ridge community.

370
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,022
She was the daughter
of Charles Shepard,

371
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,625
who died in service
during the war,

372
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,895
and her brother also died
in service during the war,

373
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,763
both from disease.

374
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:53,133
They had at least 10 children.

375
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,769
They also raised two nieces.

376
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,638
And he owned a farm.

377
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,041
At the nearest documentation
I can find,

378
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,576
he had at least 60 acres.

379
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,312
I believe he had a lot more
than that at one point.

380
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,047
But in 1895,

381
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:12,186
in this community, there were
over 700 acres of land

382
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,954
owned by Black farmers.

383
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:17,357
This was
a successful community,

384
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,959
agricultural settlement,

385
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:21,195
about five miles west
of Lancaster,

386
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,164
if you know where Lancaster is.

387
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:28,068
They built a church
on donated land.

388
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,771
They built a school.

389
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,640
And the school was good enough

390
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,910
that white families
surrounding the community

391
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,645
sent their kids there.

392
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,214
They got a good education.

393
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,717
And this is one of the things
that, in the end,

394
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,186
was kind of the demise
of the community.

395
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,156
The kids were educated,
they were all literate.

396
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,859
Thomas Greene never learned
to read or write,

397
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,994
but their children did,

398
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,996
and many of them
went on to be teachers.

399
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:59,566
One became a dentist,
a Pullman porter.

400
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:05,372
The combination of
not wanting to continue farming

401
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,641
and also the fact
that it started

402
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,078
as such a small community,
after a generation or two,

403
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,213
there were
no marriageable partners anymore

404
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,648
within the community.

405
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:18,285
Led to a lot of them
leaving for cities.

406
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,924
There was a big event
that happened

407
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,326
in that community
in early August,

408
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,428
and it took place
on Thomas Greene's farm.

409
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,297
There was a barbecue

410
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,267
that was attended
by 600 to 800 people every year.

411
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,436
Now, when you think about
this community,

412
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,839
the Black community
on Pleasant Ridge

413
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,542
never reached even 200 people.

414
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,545
There were a lot of white people
who came to this,

415
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,947
who were welcome to it,
it was a big event.

416
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,149
And in the history of it,

417
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:53,153
there reportedly were
no incidents or negative events.

418
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,788
This was written up

419
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:59,993
in the NAACP's national
magazine, <i>The Crisis,</i> in 1830.

420
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,496
The date for it
is kind of interesting.

421
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,198
They always had it
in early August.

422
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,167
And this goes back to the 1830s,

423
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:11,371
when slavery was abolished
on the British islands

424
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,106
in the Caribbean.

425
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,109
The date that this happened
was celebrated

426
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:18,512
within Black communities
in the U.S.

427
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:22,282
in hopes that the same thing
might happen here someday.

428
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,251
After the Civil War,

429
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,921
people kept celebrating
Emancipation Day in August,

430
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,090
one of the reasons
for that being

431
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,860
it's no fun to have a picnic
in January in Wisconsin.

432
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,394
[audience laughing]

433
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,464
So these typically had
a barbecue, baseball game,

434
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,067
parades, music, a dance,
everything.

435
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,469
They were in a lot
of communities in the state

436
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:46,740
in the 1880s, and again,
this reflects the fact that,

437
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,542
in the 19th century,

438
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,410
the African Americans
in Wisconsin

439
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,280
lived on farms
and in small towns,

440
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:55,015
not in cities.

441
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,720
Thomas Greene also received
an old-age pension.

442
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:04,124
He died in 1937, which,
when you think about it,

443
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,161
is only 10 years
before I was born.

444
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,663
So it's not...

445
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,465
You know, when you think
about it that way,

446
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:14,468
it's not that ancient,
this history.

447
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,636
The picture on the right

448
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:19,940
is a view of the
African American settlement

449
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:24,811
at Old World Wisconsin,
the state historical park.

450
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,881
This was done in the late 1890s.

451
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:31,084
The building you can see there
is a replica of the church

452
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,288
that they built
at Pleasant Ridge.

453
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,424
There's another building
nearby there

454
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:40,727
that is an actual outbuilding
that was connected to the church

455
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:41,929
that was moved
from Pleasant Ridge

456
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:43,864
to Old World Wisconsin.

457
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,032
And the gravestones,

458
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,034
there's not a real cemetery
there.

459
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,605
The stones are replicas of the
tombstones in the cemetery

460
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,707
that still stands
at Pleasant Ridge,

461
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,442
and the one in the front here

462
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,311
is the tombstone
of Thomas Grimes,

463
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,947
who was also
a Civil War veteran.

464
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,682
And he has an interesting story,

465
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:05,485
but I can't go into it here
because I have limited time.

466
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,789
So, our next veteran
is Henry Sink.

467
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,226
He's the one
I probably know the best,

468
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,760
because he's the one

469
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,230
about whom
I co-authored an article

470
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:19,967
for the <i>Wisconsin Magazine</i>
<i>of History.</i>

471
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:24,271
He was born--
and I'll mention on top.

472
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:28,442
He was a member of Company F,
29th U.S. Colored Infantry.

473
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:31,812
That company was known
as the Milwaukee Company

474
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,615
and is the only unit
of the U.S. Colored Troops

475
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,816
that was recognized

476
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:38,519
by the the War Department
in Washington

477
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,487
as a Wisconsin unit.

478
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:45,926
So, Henry Sink was born enslaved
in Arkansas.

479
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:48,328
He escaped during the war

480
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,632
and lived in Rosendale
and Fond du Lac,

481
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:55,269
nearby each other,
and did farm labor.

482
00:23:56,003 --> 00:24:01,308
Now, when Lincoln signed the
Emancipation Proclamation,

483
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,277
he and most of his generals

484
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:07,014
were not looking
at future Black troops

485
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,616
as combat soldiers.

486
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,853
They were looking at,
they were going to use them

487
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,023
as support troops,
you know, manning forts,

488
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:20,494
guarding supply lines,
railroads, et cetera,

489
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:23,297
prisoner of war camps,
things like that.

490
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:25,132
Most of them,

491
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,701
like Thomas Greene
and John Valentine,

492
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,570
did garrison duty,

493
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:32,639
manning forts
that had already been captured.

494
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:34,942
But there are
a good number of,

495
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:39,680
in fact, many thousands of the
U.S. Colored Troops saw combat,

496
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:43,050
including two regiments
from Wisconsin

497
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:45,619
that had a number of men
from Wisconsin.

498
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,754
One of them was the 29th.

499
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,261
When the Black troops
were called into duty,

500
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:57,331
as in combat,
they performed well, as you,

501
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:00,167
if you've seen
the movie <i>Glory,</i>

502
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,803
which was about
the 54th Massachusetts

503
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,272
and the first battle
that they were in,

504
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,407
in the Carolinas,
near Charleston.

505
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,877
There were Wisconsin men
in that unit, too.

506
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,812
Among the men who left the state

507
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:16,083
were men in the 54th
and 55th Massachusetts.

508
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:19,286
So, Henry Sink is in the
29th U.S. Colored Infantry.

509
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,222
His company arrives
near Petersburg, Virginia,

510
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,726
in the middle of July
and finds out,

511
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,762
"Oh, we're going to lead
an attack

512
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,498
on Petersburg in two weeks."

513
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,234
Until they got there,

514
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:38,539
they really hadn't handled
weapons with live ammunition,

515
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:42,242
so they were kind of green,
but they wanted to go,

516
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:45,679
so they performed maneuvers
that they would do

517
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,247
on the day of the battle.

518
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,883
What was going to happen
was a group of miners,

519
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,086
soldiers who were miners,
coal miners, from Pennsylvania

520
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:57,124
dug a tunnel
underneath Confederate lines,

521
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,859
filled it with explosives.

522
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:02,296
On the early morning
of the 29th, they blew it up.

523
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:07,167
Huge crater, which is
where the battle got its name.

524
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:10,470
The division
of the U.S. Colored Troops

525
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:14,041
was supposed to lead
the immediate initial attack.

526
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,909
The night before,

527
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:19,813
General Meade and General Grant
overrode that decision,

528
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,916
and they drew straws to assign

529
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,252
which unit was going to lead
the attack.

530
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:29,456
They assigned it
to a habitually drunken general

531
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:32,659
of a tired regiment,
or a tired division,

532
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:35,863
and after the crater blew up,
they did nothing

533
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,266
but block the pathways
or entryways

534
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:44,805
which the soldiers behind them
could use to advance.

535
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,140
A number of them went up
and saw the crater.

536
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,742
"Oh, look at that thing."

537
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,044
And they went down
in the crater.

538
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,281
So they didn't take advantage
of it at all.

539
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,416
The division
of the U.S. Colored Troops

540
00:26:56,483 --> 00:27:00,220
wanted to take the lead that
they weren't allowed to.

541
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,788
Four hours after the explosion,

542
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:07,327
the Confederates have regrouped,
but now the U.S. Colored Troops

543
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,897
are at a point
where they can move forward,

544
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,231
and they do anyway,

545
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:14,334
even though it's pretty much
hopeless at that point.

546
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,937
And there's a letter
to the editor in a,

547
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:18,772
I believe it was
a Sheboygan paper

548
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,009
from a white soldier
from Wisconsin saying,

549
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,011
"It just pained me
to watch these guys.

550
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,613
"They had no hope of winning
at all,

551
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,948
"but they went in

552
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:31,752
"absolutely enthusiastic
and aggressive,

553
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,621
and they took heavy casualties."

554
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:38,192
What they were trying to do
was follow their original plan,

555
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,360
but it was four hours too late.

556
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:44,698
So, in the Battle of the Crater,
10 Wisconsin men died.

557
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:49,903
At least 23 others were wounded,
including Henry Sink.

558
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:53,540
He took a Mini? ball
to his left elbow

559
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:57,277
so that his left elbow,
arm, for life

560
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,579
was in this position.

561
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,647
He couldn't straighten
or bend his elbow.

562
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:03,283
He couldn't turn his palm over.

563
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,820
So he was discharged
for disability,

564
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,623
and pensioned,

565
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,827
and I want to mention here,
his pension was--

566
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,196
The pensions
that soldiers received

567
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:18,398
were studied
in the last about 20 years

568
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:23,370
and found that a Black veteran
with a said disability

569
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:28,175
would receive
less pension per month

570
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:31,211
than a white soldier
with an equivalent disability.

571
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,582
So, pensions were available to
both Black and white soldiers,

572
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:40,020
but there was an inequality
in distributing them.

573
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,859
Now, when he returned,
Henry Sink went to work

574
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,996
in a factory in Fond du Lac,
a sawmill,

575
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,665
owned by a man
named J.Q. Griffith,

576
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:55,435
who, during the war,
paid $5 a month to the families

577
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,837
of all employees

578
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,239
who volunteered to serve
in the war.

579
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:02,976
After the war, he hired
all those guys back,

580
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:06,914
and he even hired disabled
veterans like Henry Sink.

581
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,516
His job was on maintenance,
tending the fires,

582
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,085
but he also hired
an able-bodied Black veteran

583
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:14,021
to work in the factory, too.

584
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,323
This was very unusual.

585
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,427
In the factories in Wisconsin
in the late 1800s,

586
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,429
it was immigrants
who were getting the jobs,

587
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:23,597
not African Americans.

588
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:25,465
That's true in Milwaukee, too.

589
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:27,467
But he was hired there,
worked there.

590
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,937
He later lived in De Pere,
in Green Bay.

591
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,972
In De Pere, he owned a home,

592
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,808
not a very fancy one,
but it was his.

593
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,879
He was married three times,
and one of his--

594
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:42,549
his second wife was the widow
of another veteran.

595
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,018
So, again, these marriage
and family connections

596
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,888
between these guys were strong.

597
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:51,625
He was a member of the GAR,
as you can see from his badge.

598
00:29:51,692 --> 00:29:54,494
He also was a resident
for a short time

599
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,731
of the King soldiers' home
in Waupaca,

600
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,468
but as the end of his life came,
he went back to Fond du Lac,

601
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:02,769
stayed
with some relatives there,

602
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,805
and died there in 1905.

603
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:12,079
Benjamin Butts is
an interesting story, too.

604
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:16,250
He was born enslaved
in Virginia.

605
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,587
Now, young man, back row,
how old are you?

606
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:21,788
- Attendee 1: The same age.

607
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,423
- Attendee 2: Fourteen.
- How old?

608
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,691
- Attendee 2: Fourteen.
- Fourteen?

609
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:27,294
Well, he was younger than you.

610
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,363
At age 12, he escaped.

611
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,065
He was enslaved
near Petersburg, Virginia.

612
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:36,270
He escaped at age 12
to the 5th Wisconsin Infantry.

613
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,805
He was with them
for not a long time.

614
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,407
And when they came back
to Wisconsin,

615
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:42,609
he came back with them.

616
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,712
He was not a rostered soldier,

617
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,583
but he's here as basically
representative of the fact

618
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,787
that I have about 180,
190 African Americans

619
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:59,026
who were employed
by Wisconsin regiments,

620
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:05,732
and either were on the rosters
or I found them in other ways.

621
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,568
So, he was one
I found in other ways

622
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,903
'cause he wasn't
a rostered soldier,

623
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,440
and that was an issue
for many men later on.

624
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,542
I'll tell you why later.

625
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,512
So he came back to Wisconsin,
first to Richland County

626
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:20,981
and eventually to Madison.

627
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,317
He married Amy
or Anna Roberts--

628
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,185
she went by both names--

629
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:27,454
who was the daughter
of veteran Aaron Roberts,

630
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:29,223
who lived in that
Cheyenne Valley community

631
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:30,958
in Vernon County.

632
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,828
In Madison, he was a barber.

633
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:37,798
In fact, his barber shop
was at 5 North Pinckney,

634
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,567
which we could throw a rock
from here and hit it.

635
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,302
Very close by.

636
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,138
He also worked
as a valet and doorman

637
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,007
for a number
of prominent business

638
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:51,512
and political officials,
and among his clients

639
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:55,949
was Robert M. La Follette,
the governor and future senator.

640
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,918
So, he was connected

641
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,589
to some important
famous people here.

642
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,762
In his last 30 years,
he worked as a messenger

643
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:12,232
for the Wisconsin
Historical Society.

644
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,967
Now, unusual.

645
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:15,969
I have two pictures of him.

646
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:18,739
One is a formal portrait
later in life,

647
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,440
but one's a pretty young one.

648
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:21,842
I have very few
pictures like this

649
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,010
of any of the soldiers,

650
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:26,213
but that's a nice
young picture of him,

651
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,514
probably before he was married,

652
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,183
or maybe it's from
when he was married.

653
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:30,918
I don't know.

654
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,487
Now, Amy, his wife,

655
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,890
I found listed as one
of the members or founders

656
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:40,194
of the Douglass
Literary Society.

657
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:43,130
I haven't found out
exactly what that was.

658
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:46,500
I was kind of assuming, well,
this must be like a book club

659
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:47,668
or something like that,

660
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:50,571
or a writers' group
or something.

661
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,439
And that might be true.

662
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:54,441
But the only other concrete
thing I found about that

663
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:58,412
is this group is listed
as the moving force

664
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,381
behind the formation

665
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:06,253
of St. Paul's African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Madison.

666
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,389
Again, these,
again, the wives, also,

667
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:12,092
but these guys were often
involved in the religious life

668
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,961
of their community as well.

669
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:16,697
Now, they had a son,
they had two children.

670
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:21,568
They had a son, Leo,
who did two interesting things.

671
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:26,607
Again, Benny Butts was enslaved
'til age 12.

672
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,709
He did learn to read and write
in Richland County.

673
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:31,812
He attended school
and learned to read and write.

674
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,214
Leo went to the
University of Wisconsin.

675
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,683
He's the first
African American graduate

676
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,219
of the UW pharmacy school.

677
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,823
A couple months ago, I found
a really interesting book

678
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,126
called <i>Settlin'</i>
by Muriel Simms.

679
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,861
Wonderful book.

680
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:52,132
You know, my research comes up
to the '20s or '30s,

681
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,669
and she does oral histories
with people since then.

682
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:58,805
But there's a lot of connections
between the people I researched

683
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,774
and the people
that she talked to.

684
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,844
But one of the things in common
between them is

685
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:08,315
that the people she talked to
often in Madison

686
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,351
had to work in jobs
well below their qualifications,

687
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:13,453
well below their education.

688
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,722
And that's the case
with Leo Butts.

689
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,858
UW pharmacy school graduate.

690
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:20,160
Couldn't run a pharmacy
in Madison.

691
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:21,595
Not enough support for it.

692
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,630
He moved to Gary, Indiana,

693
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:28,101
where he had a thriving pharmacy
until the Depression hit,

694
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,671
at which point there was
no money in it anymore.

695
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:34,474
He became a mail carrier
during the Depression years.

696
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:38,679
Now, the other thing he did
was he played football.

697
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,414
He was the first
African American

698
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,717
to play varsity football
for the Badgers.

699
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:45,452
So there you go.

700
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:52,125
And he was the son and grandson
of a Civil War veteran.

701
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:57,798
In looking through rosters
of Madison GAR posts,

702
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,534
I never found
Benjamin Butts listed

703
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:02,603
on any of the rosters.

704
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:07,341
I'm sure if he had applied,
he would have been accepted,

705
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:08,642
but he may not have applied

706
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,278
because he may not have
considered his service

707
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:14,515
equivalent to those guys who
had served two or three years,

708
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:15,983
'cause, his,
again, his time,

709
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:20,053
he was only 12 years old,
his time was short.

710
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:23,056
Okay, the last two men
I'm talking about

711
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,391
both lived in Appleton

712
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,460
for most
of their post-war lives.

713
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:29,730
Horace Artis,
also written "Artist,"

714
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,499
was in the 31st
U.S. Colored Infantry.

715
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:37,237
He was born enslaved
in Virginia near Appomattox.

716
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:39,907
I keep telling you, we're gonna
come back to Appomattox.

717
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,175
We are, okay?

718
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,576
But this is one of the links.

719
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,545
That's where he was enslaved.

720
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:46,680
He married
while he was at Appomattox,

721
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,349
again,
a marriage during slavery,

722
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,918
so not legally recognized,

723
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,754
but they remained married
for life.

724
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,559
In 1862, they escaped
together to Washington, D.C.,

725
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,361
where he enlisted
not long after that,

726
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:05,032
joined the 31st,
and in April of 1865,

727
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:07,501
he found himself
back at Appomattox,

728
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,136
but not as a slave anymore,

729
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:13,540
but as a soldier fighting
to get rid of slavery.

730
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:18,846
After the war,
they moved to Outagamie County.

731
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:22,749
They worked on farms
around Shiocton for a while.

732
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:25,552
Then he worked as a laborer
in Appleton

733
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,855
for various individuals
or companies

734
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:33,260
and worked for a long time
for the Appleton Water Utility.

735
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,864
He was a GAR member.

736
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,233
There's the badge again.

737
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,668
And they had a son, Oliver,

738
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:45,939
who married the daughter
of veteran Anderson Reese

739
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:47,674
from Fond du Lac.

740
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:53,413
His wife's name was Bercina,
and in the 1880s,

741
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,517
she did an interview with one
of the Appleton newspapers,

742
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:00,120
and this is a little clip
from the newspaper

743
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:02,389
of her telling her story.

744
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,224
"She was placed under a barrel

745
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,027
"and kept there all day
and all night,

746
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,097
"being fed on crusts and scraps
like a dog.

747
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:13,600
"Repeated floggings literally
covered her back with scars,

748
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,904
which she will carry
to her grave."

749
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:18,906
There are people going around

750
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:20,641
saying that slavery
was beneficial

751
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,943
to the enslaved people,

752
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:27,714
and we need to keep this in mind
as the reality

753
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:31,652
and not the excellent job
training they may have gotten

754
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,354
during their years
of enslavement.

755
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,557
Bercina died in 1909,

756
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:40,093
and Horace died a year later,
in 1910.

757
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,198
Okay, Appomattox, finally.

758
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:48,101
Appomattox
was the final large battle

759
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:49,937
in Virginia.

760
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:53,707
It was the last battle
fought by Robert E. Lee's army.

761
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:57,444
The 31st,
in which Horace Artis served,

762
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:01,782
and the 29th, in which over
100 Wisconsin men served,

763
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,585
were part of a division
of U.S. Colored Troops

764
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:07,988
who marched all night,
April 8 and 9,

765
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:10,657
through the entire night

766
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:13,427
and arrived at Appomattox
just in time

767
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:17,397
to cut off Robert E. Lee's
only escape route,

768
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,566
continue south,
and try and hook up

769
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,902
with Joe Johnston's army,

770
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,704
which was still fighting
General Sherman

771
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,439
in the Carolinas.

772
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:28,809
Their march all night
is what sealed off Lee

773
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,112
and basically
ended the Civil War.

774
00:38:33,914 --> 00:38:36,350
George Washington Williams was
an African American historian

775
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,418
who wrote in the 1880s

776
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:41,288
that the last guns fired
at Robert E. Lee's army

777
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:43,390
were in the hands
of Negro soldiers,

778
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:47,961
and over 100 of them were
from right here in Wisconsin.

779
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:51,164
Now, I went to Appomattox
in 2017,

780
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:53,367
went through this complex.

781
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,035
It was very interesting.

782
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:56,904
Visitors center,
I saw the movie,

783
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,840
looked around
in the visitors center,

784
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,341
and there was no mention
anywhere

785
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:03,610
of the U.S. Colored Troops,

786
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,446
and there was one picture
of an African American man,

787
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:09,750
and, reading the caption,
it said he was there

788
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:13,720
as the slave
of a Confederate general.

789
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:16,790
There were thousands
of U.S. Colored Troops there.

790
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,193
That's the only picture
and the only mention

791
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:21,762
of an African American man
in the visitors center.

792
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:23,497
But I saw on the map

793
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:26,166
there was an exhibit
somewhere down over here,

794
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:29,136
just off the edge,
on the U.S. Colored Troops

795
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,538
and slavery
in the Appomattox area.

796
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:34,074
So, I went down there,
and it was padlocked.

797
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:35,242
It was locked.

798
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,244
So I went back up
to the visitors center

799
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,479
and asked to be let in,
and they let me in.

800
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,182
Somebody came down with me
and opened the padlock.

801
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,884
Walked in, nice display,

802
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,652
including
when you walk right in the door,

803
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,689
a huge picture of Horace Artis.

804
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:51,358
Wow!

805
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,360
It doesn't mention the fact
that he went to Wisconsin,

806
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:55,696
but, oh, that's really cool!

807
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:58,866
And, again, they explained,
you know, his enlistment,

808
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,701
enslavement, his enlistment.

809
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,804
He's back here at the
final battle at Appomattox.

810
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:05,005
So, I came back out.

811
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,040
The guy padlocked
the door again.

812
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:08,742
I said,
"Why do you keep it locked?"

813
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,844
"Well, hardly anybody
ever goes in here."

814
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,513
"Well, it's
'cause you keep it locked."

815
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,114
[audience laughing]
So I went up and asked

816
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:17,784
about this, and I said,
"Well, why aren't,

817
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:20,320
"why is there no mention
whatsoever

818
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:22,322
of African Americans
in this display?"

819
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,892
He said, "Well, we did talk
about them in the movie."

820
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:28,529
Yeah, that's true,
but nothing in the displays.

821
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:32,266
And he said, "Well,
we have to be careful

822
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:38,172
of the sensibilities
of our neighbors around here."

823
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,873
Well, only certain neighbors,
I guess,

824
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,742
the white supremacist
neighbors,

825
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:43,744
'cause there are still
Black people living in the area.

826
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,713
But, anyway, I wrote a letter
to the director after that

827
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,582
and never heard back.

828
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:50,317
So if any of you
go to Appomattox,

829
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:53,720
check this out
and see what's there.

830
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:57,958
Joseph Ellmore was born free
in Illinois.

831
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,728
His death certificate says
his father was born in Germany

832
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:04,398
and his mother
was born in Abyssinia,

833
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,167
which is
the old name for Ethiopia.

834
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,837
So, he had
an interesting background.

835
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:12,439
Before the war,
he's living in La Crosse,

836
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:14,741
working in a butcher shop
with Michael Brady,

837
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,877
who also served in the Civil War

838
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:19,980
in the same regiment
with John Valentine.

839
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:23,784
He volunteered at La Crosse,
shipped to Madison.

840
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:25,752
He never got out
of Camp Randall.

841
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,556
He had an accident there, fell,
wrecked his left shoulder,

842
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:31,925
broke his left scapula,
shoulder blade,

843
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:34,862
so his service time
he spent in Madison

844
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:37,731
working in the post hospital.

845
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:41,001
He went back to La Crosse
after the war,

846
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,870
went back to work
with Michael Brady again

847
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:44,137
in the butcher shop,

848
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:47,808
and Brady later wrote
in Ellmore's pension files

849
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,811
that after the war,
he couldn't do the work anymore.

850
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:53,380
His left arm was
just too damaged and too weak

851
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:56,149
for him to do
butcher work anymore,

852
00:41:56,216 --> 00:42:00,287
so he ended up moving
to a long list of places.

853
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:04,258
He lived in St. Paul, Dubuque,
Eau Claire,

854
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:12,499
Madison, Oshkosh,
and finally, Appleton.

855
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:14,935
Somewhere along the way,
he became a barber,

856
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:19,306
which turned out to be a work
he could do and do well.

857
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,041
He married Emma.

858
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:24,144
They had no children.

859
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,548
But they had
parties at their house,

860
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:30,517
which included,
in Appleton again,

861
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:35,355
the leaders of both
the Black and white communities.

862
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:39,226
They were very popular,
highly attended,

863
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,394
unique situation.

864
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,030
This is in the 1880s, 1890s.

865
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,499
So they were
kind of famous for that.

866
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,067
He was also an agent

867
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:49,403
for the
<i>Wisconsin Weekly Advocate,</i>

868
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:52,539
which was a weekly
African American-owned newspaper

869
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:54,274
in Milwaukee.

870
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:59,813
And the picture of Emma
is from a December 1904 issue

871
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,682
of that newspaper.

872
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,951
Ellmore died in 1913.

873
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:09,156
His obituary named him
as the dean of local barbers.

874
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:15,562
Now, when he died, Emma
did not get a widow's pension.

875
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:18,298
Joseph had an invalid pension
because of his injury,

876
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:20,100
but Emma did not get one

877
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:23,937
because Joseph had served
less than 90 days.

878
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:27,474
Technicality,
but she never got one.

879
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:31,645
In 1899,
this is kind of following up

880
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:33,013
on the Ellmore story.

881
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,716
1899,
a woman named Mary Cleggett

882
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:39,052
wrote a letter to the editor
of one of the Appleton papers

883
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,787
from Arkansas,

884
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,924
and it was kind of
a nostalgic letter

885
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:46,393
for how much she missed
being there

886
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,095
and being now in Arkansas,

887
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:52,099
where Jim Crow segregation
was now fully in place.

888
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,600
She was the daughter
of William Cleggett,

889
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:57,271
who was an employee of
a Wisconsin regiment for a while

890
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:58,605
early in the war,

891
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:01,108
and in her letter,
she mentions the Ellmores

892
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,876
and the parties they held,

893
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,680
and describes it as
a sharp contrast with Arkansas.

894
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:09,917
Even in Appleton, it was
almost a Black aristocracy.

895
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,553
People who were accepted
by the white community

896
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:16,690
and, you know,
had social relations with them.

897
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:19,693
A few weeks later,
there was a letter to the editor

898
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,430
from a white woman from Appleton
who had just gone south,

899
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:25,532
and in the letter,
she makes a comment

900
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,800
that's personally directed

901
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:32,005
to one of the daughters
of Horace and Bercina Artis,

902
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:34,675
and she says to her, "If you
have a home in Wisconsin

903
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,710
"where you can breathe
the free air of liberty,

904
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,111
"for God's sake, stay there.

905
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,980
Don't come south."

906
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,916
Now take a look
at the clipping on the right.

907
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,718
That was 1899.

908
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:48,789
1916, William S. Cleggett,
Mary's father,

909
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:53,961
"The only Negro in Appleton
died last night."

910
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,096
How did we go
from the Black aristocracy

911
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:58,966
to the last Negro in Appleton?

912
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,803
This was not
an isolated situation.

913
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,738
This happened
all over Wisconsin.

914
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:07,708
It happened all over the North.

915
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:10,811
In the same years
that Jim Crow segregation

916
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:14,214
was being implemented
in the South,

917
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:18,952
Black civil rights in the North
were going backwards as well.

918
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:20,621
One of the cases
that I remember,

919
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:24,258
Wisconsin passed
a civil rights law, 1895,

920
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:27,394
the same year that the
"separate but equal" decision

921
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:29,162
by the Supreme Court was made.

922
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:31,098
So you might say,
"Well, that was good.

923
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:32,299
That was progress."

924
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,835
But to get the law passed,

925
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:39,540
the penalty for violating
the law was a $5 fine.

926
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:44,077
So, John Miles, a Black veteran
from Milwaukee,

927
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,613
went to the Schlitz
beer garden in Milwaukee,

928
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,117
big social gathering place,
and was denied entry.

929
00:45:50,184 --> 00:45:53,220
He sued
based on the civil rights law.

930
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:54,521
He won.

931
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,224
The Schlitz beer garden
was fined $5,

932
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,959
and they went on discriminating.

933
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:02,262
The $5 fine
was no deterrent at all.

934
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,899
It was
a totally ineffective law.

935
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,635
So...

936
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:12,973
I found newspaper clippings
like this in many towns

937
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,008
where,
when the last veteran died,

938
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:18,312
he was also the last
African American living in town.

939
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:20,380
Lake Mills, Portage.

940
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:24,751
Where else, Milton,
a number of cities.

941
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:26,486
Those communities disappeared.

942
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:28,455
In 1870, Fond du Lac

943
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:30,691
had the largest Black population
in Wisconsin,

944
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:33,293
bigger than Milwaukee,
bigger than Madison.

945
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,596
By 1920, it was single digits,

946
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:38,031
and those that were left
were pretty much run out

947
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:40,501
when the KKK
had its statewide rally

948
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,569
a few blocks
from the Black church

949
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,338
in Fond du Lac.

950
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:46,573
So, this was,
it wasn't an accident.

951
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,043
Again, some of the movement
away from the small towns

952
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,679
was because of what I talked
about before at Pleasant Ridge.

953
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:55,315
The educational system
was so good.

954
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:58,785
For the kids,
they had opportunities in cities

955
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:01,421
that they didn't have
staying on the farm.

956
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,023
But some of it was hostility.

957
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,225
Some of it was,
some was hostility.

958
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:06,527
Some of it was just

959
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:08,929
"Eh, I just don't want to have
anything to do with them

960
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:10,597
anymore."

961
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,000
It was shunning or it was,

962
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:18,372
just a distancing
that could be felt,

963
00:47:18,438 --> 00:47:20,574
and so the communities died.

964
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,309
They fell apart.

965
00:47:24,778 --> 00:47:26,446
Now...

966
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,417
I've got one more,

967
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:31,818
a couple more things
to talk about,

968
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:35,088
and I'll open it up
for questions.

969
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:37,824
As we went through these men,

970
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,362
all these guys
were privates, right?

971
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,764
There were a number
of Wisconsin men

972
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,966
who served as sergeants,
corporals,

973
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:49,670
hospital stewards,
or commissary sergeants,

974
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:51,939
though there were men
of higher rank

975
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,841
among the Black soldiers
from Wisconsin.

976
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:56,743
But the highest rank
you could get to was sergeant.

977
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,846
Everyone
in the U.S. Colored Troops

978
00:47:58,912 --> 00:48:01,882
from lieutenant up
had to be white.

979
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,786
All of these men
are buried in Wisconsin,

980
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,889
and all of them have
gravestones or tombstones.

981
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,324
Charles Henry Taylor,

982
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,494
the one who John Valentine
served as a guardian for,

983
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,662
is in an unmarked grave,

984
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,131
but I'm working
with a group in Waukesha

985
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,133
to get his grave marked now.

986
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,202
There have been some others
that we've found, too,

987
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:23,904
where we've gotten grave markers

988
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:28,442
for soldiers who are buried
in unmarked graves.

989
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,144
Four of them
were members of the GAR,

990
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,147
the four guys
who had their badges on.

991
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:36,016
Benny Butts was not.

992
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,218
Thomas Greene was not.

993
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:39,686
Joseph Ellmore may have been.

994
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:44,391
I just have not been able to
document whether or not he was.

995
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:47,227
All of them received invalid
or old-age pensions,

996
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:48,795
except for Benjamin Butts.

997
00:48:48,862 --> 00:48:51,665
Again, because he was not
a rostered soldier,

998
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:53,667
he didn't qualify for a pension.

999
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:55,536
It didn't matter what you did.

1000
00:48:55,602 --> 00:49:00,507
If your name wasn't on the
roster, you got no pension.

1001
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:02,509
Now, people like him, though,

1002
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:04,511
I'll clarify, people like him,
though,

1003
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:05,913
there were a number
of these guys

1004
00:49:05,979 --> 00:49:07,881
who were employees,

1005
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,650
on the roster,
not on the roster,

1006
00:49:09,716 --> 00:49:12,085
who were accepted as GAR members

1007
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:14,054
'cause the white veterans
in their community

1008
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:17,424
recognized their service
and accepted them as members.

1009
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:19,660
Even though
they really weren't technically

1010
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:25,732
honorably discharged veterans,
they were accepted as members.

1011
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:30,704
Two of these men
signed their enlistment papers.

1012
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:32,940
They were John Valentine
and Joseph Ellmore,

1013
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:35,209
the two men who were born free.

1014
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:36,710
It's not surprising
the others didn't

1015
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:38,745
because they were born enslaved

1016
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:41,782
and were still enslaved
when the war began.

1017
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,817
Two of them never did learn
to read or write,

1018
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:47,988
but the other three did learn
to read and write later in life.

1019
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:49,456
And there are,

1020
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:51,859
again, there are men
I talk about in the book

1021
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:53,894
who went to college,

1022
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:56,029
who began
their Civil War service

1023
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,298
unable to write their own name,

1024
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:01,502
but got educated enough
to have attended college

1025
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:03,504
to become teachers

1026
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,307
and other positions
of responsibility.

1027
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:08,942
All the men who were married

1028
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,279
were related to other soldiers
by marriage,

1029
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:13,514
either their kids

1030
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,550
or they married the sister
or the daughter

1031
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:18,352
or the widow of another veteran.

1032
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:21,922
So, there were
serious permanent ties

1033
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:24,591
between these guys,
unlike what was written

1034
00:50:24,658 --> 00:50:27,694
in some of the history books
I read initially.

1035
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:30,731
Now, these are not the only
six or seven interesting stories

1036
00:50:30,797 --> 00:50:31,999
in the book.

1037
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:35,536
I think the most interesting
ones are still in there.

1038
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:37,404
But these are good.

1039
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:41,775
How is it that these six
were picked to be on the cover?

1040
00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:44,811
Well, the artist
who worked on the cover

1041
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:48,182
decided to put pictures
of soldiers on the cover,

1042
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:51,385
and these guys had
very high-quality photographs

1043
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:52,786
that we had of them.

1044
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:54,588
So, that was the reason.

1045
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:57,257
They all turned out
to be interesting stories,

1046
00:50:57,324 --> 00:51:00,594
but they had photographs
because they stuck around.

1047
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:01,762
They stayed in Wisconsin.

1048
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:03,096
They managed,

1049
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:05,332
sometimes immediately
or sometimes after a struggle,

1050
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:10,370
to establish themselves here
and also to join the GAR,

1051
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:12,239
which is where four
of those photographs are from,

1052
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:15,876
from the portrait sets
that they made.

1053
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,546
In that sense,
they're not typical.

1054
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:22,149
Most of the men
who served from Wisconsin

1055
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:24,351
didn't end up staying here,

1056
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,988
although, again, there are
African American veterans

1057
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:31,558
of the Civil War buried
in 31 counties in the state,

1058
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:34,962
which, again, is a reflection
of where they lived

1059
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:36,964
when they were here.

1060
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,398
Most of the men who served

1061
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:40,601
with connections
to Wisconsin, though,

1062
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:43,036
kept moving on,
like Joseph Ellmore did,

1063
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:44,938
but he found his niche
in Appleton.

1064
00:51:45,005 --> 00:51:48,475
Many of them moved west,
moved south,

1065
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:53,413
and many of them never got
beyond being day laborers,

1066
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,749
living basically in poverty.

1067
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:57,351
It was a hard life.

1068
00:51:57,417 --> 00:52:01,421
So, these guys were
not typical in that way.

1069
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:07,961
So, of all the nearly 700 men
that I've documented,

1070
00:52:08,028 --> 00:52:11,398
African Americans
who served from Wisconsin,

1071
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:15,235
I found photographs
of only 36 of them.

1072
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,470
There are probably
more out there,

1073
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:19,473
but that's all I found so far.

1074
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,209
So, with that, I'll leave off

1075
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:26,380
the open the floor
for questions.

1076
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:27,681
Thank you for coming.

1077
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:29,983
