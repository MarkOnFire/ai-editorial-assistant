[acoustic guitar]

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:06,792
Waking up to greet the day...

3
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:09,291
- Liz Beukema:
4:20 every morning,
my alarm goes off.

4
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,875
I catch all the birds
and get them in the truck.

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,999
- Liz Beukema has had
this same routine

6
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:17,834
for more than
a decade.

7
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,083
- Liz Beukema:
That may be why... [laughs]

8
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,999
May be why
it's a low-participation sport.

9
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:28,333
- Pigeon racing became popular
in Belgium 200 years ago,

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,709
and has spread worldwide.

11
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:34,999
- Fond du Lac has a really
active pigeon community.

12
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:35,709
Milwaukee...

13
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:37,875
La Crosse has a big club
down there.

14
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,208
- But for Liz,
finding other female racers

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,917
is not very common.

16
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,999
- It's actually fairly rare.

17
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:47,999
There's not many of us,
but it's fun to find each other.
[laughs]

18
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:48,999
So, they're gonna come out.

19
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,375
I'm gonna start
with this first one.

20
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,458
[Liz claps]

21
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:57,500
We release birds about half
an hour after sun up, ideally.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,709
- Garrett Beukema: I guess
it's sort of a rare sport,

23
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,999
and it's always changing.

24
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,625
- Even more rare...

25
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,041
- We're the only ones
I know of.

26
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,083
- A mom and son
competing against each other.

27
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,999
- Garrett: This is one
of our young birds.

28
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:13,999
- Garrett got his start

29
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:17,125
after someone gifted him
racing pigeons.

30
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:21,999
- We started with 10,
and now we have 200.
[chuckles]

31
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,834
- For Garrett and Liz,

32
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,667
life on the farm
would never be the same.

33
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,041
- I started because
Garrett was 10,

34
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,999
and he couldn't drive his birds
down the road to train.

35
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:34,999
I was just kind of
along for the ride.

36
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,999
I never had a team
at first.

37
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:39,208
Garrett flew for two years
without me having a team.

38
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,834
I try to get
all scientific,

39
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,792
and Garrett's just like,
"Ah, it's all good."

40
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,834
And then, he ends up winning
every week.

41
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:49,458
- Winning also requires a lot
of time spent with your birds.

42
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,999
- Garrett: You're up
every morning and training,

43
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,000
and every weekend,
you're racing.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,750
And it gets pretty busy.

45
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,125
- But we start out slow.

46
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,208
We'll go half a mile,
we'll go two miles,

47
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,291
we'll go five miles,
and just practice.

48
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,208
They flew 90 miles this morning
on a training run.

49
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,834
- Pigeon racing
can sometimes cover 400 miles,

50
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:14,083
and the first bird home
in the fastest time wins.

51
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,709
- We want them
to have visual clues.

52
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:17,792
I want them
to see the river

53
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,125
and know that "I need
to get across the river

54
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,500
in order to get home."

55
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,999
- On race day,

56
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:24,999
the farm is quiet

57
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,500
until the pigeons
start arriving back home.

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,250
- You get a message saying,
"Yep, the birds were released

59
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,999
from, let's say, Ames, Iowa,
at 7 a.m."

60
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,083
And then, you sit in the silence
in the yard

61
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,083
and wait for birds to land
on Saturday morning.

62
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,000
When they come in,

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,208
ideally, they hear me whistle
from across the yard,

64
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,625
and they land immediately

65
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,999
and go in to eat.

66
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,417
[pigeons cooing,
Liz whistling]

67
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,208
We whistle
every time they're fed

68
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,750
from the time they're born.

69
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,417
Come on, baby.

70
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,125
Young birds,
food is their motivation.

71
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,458
They're coming home
for food.

72
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,917
- The science behind
how the pigeons

73
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,458
actually navigate
their way home

74
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,125
remains a mystery.

75
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,208
- Liz: It's magic.

76
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,166
The scientists still--
to this day-- don't know.

77
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,542
- A lot of people say
they use the sun.

78
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,999
A lot of people say
landmarks

79
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,999
and maybe
it's a little bit of both.

80
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:11,750
During pigeon racing,

81
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,500
you're just releasing them
up in the sky

82
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,875
and praying
that they come back.

83
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,917
- When they return home,

84
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:20,999
a sensor records the time
each bird enters the loft.

85
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,999
- We're always looking to see
whose bird comes home first.

86
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,917
- On race day,
it's kind of exciting

87
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,500
to figure out
where you sit.

88
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,583
- Garrett: I guess we get
pretty competitive some days.

89
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,041
I believe I won
my first race in...

90
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,375
gosh, I don't know
what year it was,
but I was pretty young.

91
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
- Garrett was on a streak
at one point

92
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,375
where he had beat me
in every race

93
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,333
for 16 straight races.

94
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,999
So, that needed to
come to an end really quickly.

95
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,667
[laughs]

96
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,041
- Through the years,
the birds got better.

97
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,250
- They double in size
every day.

98
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,834
By 30 days,
they're fully grown.

99
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:55,999
- The bond between mom and son
grew stronger.

100
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,792
- We spent a lot
of invaluable time together,

101
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:01,792
the two of us, with these birds
over the years.

102
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,709
- And the need for Garrett

103
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,583
to spread his wings

104
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,625
took flight.

105
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,999
- I think I'll miss race day
the most.

106
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:09,917
Sitting out on the porch

107
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,291
and just waiting for the birds
to fly over.

108
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,875
- Garrett is heading off
to school,

109
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,709
leaving Mom
to fly solo.

110
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,625
- A lot of the guys
at the club

111
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,542
have kind of kidded me
about that,

112
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,250
how I lost
all my good help

113
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,875
and all my...
all my magic.

114
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,999
To me, it's very interesting.
[laughs]

115
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,000
They're just amazing animals.

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm talking to
the other guys in the club

117
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,000
to see if I won or lost.
[laughs]

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,458
I love it!

119
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,417
[pigeons chirping]
