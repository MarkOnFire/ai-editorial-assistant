1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,571
- Georgia Brown: Just 'cause you
can see it and it says it,

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,906
doesn't necessarily mean
it's true.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,308
You have to think about who
made it, why they made it,

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,510
who did they make it for,

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,111
and who's getting left out
of the map.

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,312
Those are very important
to unpack

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,081
when you're looking at a map.

8
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,816
[upbeat music]

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,952
- Sergio Gonz?lez: [thinking]
All right, so if I go left,

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,120
I should get here,

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,922
but then I have to turn
around... the sticks?

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,090
That doesn't make any sense.

13
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,291
I don't understand,
this is frustrating.

14
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,693
Uh, no, is it this way,
or is it right?

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,930
So go ahead and go back around,
do-si-do.

16
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,533
I think it's jump twice
over the--

17
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,368
Oh, hey, Cat!
- Cat Phan: Hey, Sergio.

18
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,869
So sorry.

19
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,070
I'm trying to find the library.

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,238
I got this map.

21
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,440
I think it's supposed to be able
to get me there.

22
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,842
- Let's see if I can help.

23
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,343
[slide whistle]

24
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,113
Mm, I don't think this is
gonna help you.

25
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,314
- Uh, but it's a map.

26
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
This should tell me exactly
where I have to go.

27
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,386
- Uh, I think we need to learn
a little bit more about maps.

28
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,688
C'mon, let's go.
- Okay.

29
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,223
- My name's Georgia Brown,

30
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,558
and I'm the public services
librarian

31
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,060
here at the American
Geographical Society Library.

32
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,228
We're actually the

33
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,396
second-biggest map
and geography library

34
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,730
in the United States.

35
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,432
Yeah, right here in Milwaukee.

36
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,068
- Georgia, how many maps
do you guys have in here?

37
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,805
- It's not an exact count,
but 635,000

38
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,408
is the closest count we have.
- Cat: That's a lot of maps.

39
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,210
- Georgia: Yes, it is
a lot of maps.

40
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,611
And we're also unique in that

41
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,713
we're both a historical and a
contemporary map collection.

42
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,582
So our oldest thing
is from 1452,

43
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,084
and our newest stuff's
gonna be from 2025.

44
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,552
- How do you define a map?

45
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,089
- I call a map a visual
representation of a space.

46
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,091
That's a super broad definition,
and a lot of people

47
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,527
might have other, like, taglines
that they wanna put into that,

48
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,529
but that is the simplest way
to define a map.

49
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,364
A visual representation
of a space.

50
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,600
- How long have people
been using maps for?

51
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,035
- I think the oldest one that
people have ever found

52
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,271
is a Babylonian tablet.
- Sergio: Hm.

53
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,573
- So pretty much as long
as we know about history,

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,175
people have been using maps.

55
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,344
- People have been making maps
for thousands of years.

56
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,479
This clay tablet
from ancient Babylon,

57
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,914
an area in modern-day Iraq,

58
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,584
is from around 600 BCE,
over 2,500 years ago!

59
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,186
It may not look like much to us,

60
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,355
but it features
a simple representation

61
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,690
of how its creators
understood their world.

62
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,293
What are the ways in which
we know that this is a map?

63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,695
What are the, kind of the pieces
that bring a map together?

64
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,863
- Sure thing.

65
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,865
So when I teach students,
I tell them four things.

66
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,301
Maps will almost always have
a title, a scale,

67
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,203
a legend or key,
and a compass rose,

68
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,305
which shows which direction
north is.

69
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,607
And it's not always as standard
with these older maps,

70
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,409
but you can see they're starting
to do it.

71
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,011
- So what are we looking
at here?

72
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,812
You've pulled some maps
for us to look at.

73
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,214
- I pulled some
early Wisconsin stuff.

74
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,749
So these maps go from about,

75
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,751
I think the earliest one
is 1600s,

76
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,954
and then they go to as late
as 1836.

77
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,923
It's not all of Wisconsin.

78
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,124
Like I said, not on purpose.

79
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,725
Unlike this one, where Wisconsin
is right now,

80
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,561
it's called the
Northwest Territory.

81
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,230
And a couple other things don't
actually label it as Wisconsin.

82
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,631
- How do you read a map?

83
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,567
Some of these maps
are so different.

84
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,969
- No one's ever asked me
how to read a map before,

85
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,137
so good job asking me

86
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,471
a first question.
- Cat: Yay!

87
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,874
- I always give someone
a gold star when they do that.

88
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,676
For me, personally, I will find
the identifying feature

89
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,944
that I can find easiest.

90
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,545
So for Wisconsin, it's almost
always Lake Michigan.

91
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,980
So we start there.

92
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,382
Even though this is in Italian,
like, "Lago Michigan," sure.

93
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,550
It's Lake Michigan.

94
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,752
And then obviously, like,
the rest of the state

95
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,354
isn't as well-labeled
or anything else,

96
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,423
but you can kinda keep going.

97
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,493
So, like, this is really close
to Milwaukee in the spelling.

98
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,495
Just close enough that I'm like,
"Maybe that's it."

99
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,764
So that's the best way I know
how to do it,

100
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,299
especially with these
early maps of Wisconsin

101
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,135
'cause they're not labeled
with the way we spell things now

102
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,871
or the rivers
that we know about.

103
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,672
All right, so I gave you all
a copy

104
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,208
of my favorite teaching map,
which is right here.

105
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:32,813
And it is Coronelli's map
of the Great Lakes from 1687,

106
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,648
and it's my favorite
teaching map.

107
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,651
So if you look at the
Great Lakes, what do you see?

108
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,653
- I mean, the first thing
I look at is,

109
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,688
there's just a bunch
of different names in the lakes.

110
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,391
- Right, so Coronelli must have
heard conflicting reports

111
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,327
about what they were gonna call
each of the Great Lakes.

112
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,363
So instead of decide
for everybody,

113
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,899
he just writes in
for Lake Michigan,

114
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,700
"Lake Illinois,"
"Lake Michigami,"

115
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,437
or "Lake Dauphin" and lets
the people decide later on.

116
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,972
And then another reason
it's my favorite,

117
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,275
is if you'll look in the
top right, the scale,

118
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,477
it actually has, like,
the French scale,

119
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,879
the British scale,
the Italian scale.

120
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,414
So all of the miles
are different

121
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,949
'cause they're
not standardized yet.

122
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,617
They're all,
everybody has a different mile.

123
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,120
And so, it's kind of interesting
that he includes all of them.

124
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,888
Again, he's, like,
not deciding for anybody.

125
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,024
He's like, "This could,
anybody could look at this map

126
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,026
and be able to navigate
around here."

127
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,095
- One of the great conveniences
of maps is their size.

128
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,698
You can have maps
of all different sizes.

129
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,001
A map's scale is the indication
of how distances on the map

130
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,170
relate to distances
in the real world.

131
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,239
There are a few different ways
to do this.

132
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,642
A representative fraction shows
the scale as a ratio.

133
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,679
The first number, the numerator,
is always 1.

134
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,547
The second number,
the denominator,

135
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,417
is how much greater
the real-world distance is.

136
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,619
So if the scale is 1:100,

137
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,621
it means one unit of distance
on the map

138
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,724
equals 100 units of distance
in the real world.

139
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,060
That distance unit
can be anything.

140
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,629
Centimeters, feet, miles,
whatever!

141
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,932
It holds true no matter
what unit you're using.

142
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,602
- Another option is to use
a graphic scale.

143
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,438
These are bars that show
distances on the map itself.

144
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,907
The maps we looked at here
have scale bars.

145
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,742
They show how many miles
are represented

146
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,043
by the measured lines.

147
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,346
This one even has the
different miles used

148
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,814
by different countries
at the time,

149
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,283
since this was before
measurements were standardized.

150
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,353
Another way a map might show
scale is simply in writing.

151
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,056
A map might say "1 inch
represents 1 kilometer,"

152
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,691
or something like that.

153
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,027
Whatever method is used,
scale is crucial

154
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,595
for using a map to navigate.

155
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,098
- Right, so what can these maps
tell us about Wisconsin?

156
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,432
- Hmm, that's a great question.

157
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:37,437
Kind of like what the path
of the European explorers was.

158
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,605
That you can see, like,

159
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,174
the shape of Lake Michigan
gets better.

160
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,976
So if we start with this one
that you're looking at,

161
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,213
they do a terrible job
with what Green Bay looks like

162
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,482
and how the shape
of Lake Michigan actually,

163
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,818
like, looks with the state
of Wisconsin as we know it now.

164
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,654
So as time goes on,
they get better

165
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,822
at actually mapping the lake.

166
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,991
Sometimes, the people that
actually went to Wisconsin

167
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,593
made the maps,
but a lot of times,

168
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,495
it was just European map makers.

169
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,663
They were writing with people

170
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,097
who had actually been
to Wisconsin,

171
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,099
or reading books about people
who had traveled to Wisconsin.

172
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,736
So they're using, like, just
kind of, like, word of mouth.

173
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,205
- So you're telling me that

174
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,674
people would have to depend
on the ideas of somebody

175
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,309
who maybe had never been
to this area?

176
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,611
- Yes, most of the maps
in, like, the early, like,

177
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,213
before the 1800s
were made by people

178
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,647
who had never been there before.

179
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,449
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

180
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,051
- By the early modern period
in Europe,

181
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,053
there was a big increase
in the production of maps

182
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,422
explicitly made for the purposes
of navigation.

183
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,157
Now, in the areas
around the Great Lakes,

184
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,259
which includes what is now
Wisconsin,

185
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,895
the growing North American
fur trade was a big reason

186
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,364
for traveling to
and exploring the region.

187
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,366
This trade involved
the exchange of goods

188
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,868
between different cultures.

189
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,004
Europeans brought items like
metal goods and textiles

190
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,507
and traded with Native partners
for animal furs and skins.

191
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,309
Another big driver of charting
this region during the 1700s

192
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,312
was the effort to find a
Northwest Passage.

193
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,881
This was the hypothetical route

194
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,016
connecting the Atlantic
and Pacific Ocean

195
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,352
via a water passage
above North America.

196
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,554
European explorers had no way
of knowing

197
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,489
if this was even really
a possibility,

198
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,192
but that didn't stop many
of them from trying to find it.

199
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,029
In reality, the presence
of sea ice and dangerous waters

200
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,497
made this route impractical,

201
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,499
if not outright impossible
at the time.

202
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,101
But the efforts
to find such a route

203
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,269
contributed to the mapping

204
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,005
of the northern part
of the continent.

205
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,108
How can we read maps as ways
of understanding the past?

206
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,276
Because you might think of,

207
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,178
it's just a picture
of a specific moment,

208
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,479
but it's probably telling us
something

209
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,880
about a different time period
as well.

210
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,248
- Sure thing.

211
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,584
I think maps are definitely,
like, a nice little snapshot

212
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,920
into, not necessarily the time,
like a picture.

213
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,588
That's the exact moment that
something's happening.

214
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,390
But it takes a long time
to do this.

215
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,258
So just to see the different
place names

216
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,927
and what people thought
was significant.

217
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,528
Like, I don't think that
there's any mountains

218
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,130
between Milwaukee and Chicago.

219
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,199
And that's what, they're showing
a mountain range right here.

220
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,434
So fun ideas about exploration.

221
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,836
And sometimes,
map makers really just

222
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,838
didn't like blank spaces
on maps.

223
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,439
So they'd put a fun little
illustration

224
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,175
or shade something in to make it
so that they were, like,

225
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,810
not doing just blank maps.

226
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:00,080
- So tell me a little bit about
why these different countries

227
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,349
and different groups of people
would wanna make a map

228
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,352
and perhaps put themselves
squarely at the center of it?

229
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,554
- Maps are a great way
and a very quick way

230
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,556
to try to be like, "This is
actually my land."

231
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,125
So if you, you know, are erasing
people that already live there,

232
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,393
like the Native Americans,

233
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,396
you could just be, like,
"This map is all in French.

234
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,365
We've got all
French place names."

235
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,734
So, and they're not saying
anybody else lives here,

236
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,070
so they're just like,
"This is the French."

237
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,373
That map is definitely
a French declaration

238
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,809
of ownership of the
Great Lakes area.

239
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,378
- So what I'm understanding is
when we read these maps,

240
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,880
we should be careful
not to think

241
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,849
that they fully represent
who was alive or present

242
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,018
at these particular times.
- Yes, for sure.

243
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,020
Just 'cause you can see it
and it says it

244
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,188
doesn't necessarily mean
it's true.

245
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,789
You have to think about
who made it,

246
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,791
why they made it,
who did they make it for,

247
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,393
and who's getting left out
of the map.

248
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,728
Those are very important
to unpack

249
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,765
when you're looking at a map.
[television static]

250
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,234
- I hope Sergio
found his way home.

251
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,171
Maps are about so much more
than finding your way around.

252
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,607
They can also be great primary
sources for historical inquiry.

253
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,875
They tell us lots of things

254
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,677
about how the people
who made and used them

255
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,379
viewed a particular area,
country,

256
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,780
or even the whole world.

257
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,017
Like all primary sources, we
need to examine maps carefully

258
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,785
and remember that no one source

259
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,021
can ever tell the full story
of a place.

260
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,089
Looking closely
and talking to an expert

261
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,491
are great ways to get started

262
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,359
using maps
for historical research.

263
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,195
Have you ever tried
making a map?

264
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,031
See if you can draw a simple map
of a place you know well.

265
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,699
It could be your neighborhood,
your street,

266
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,101
or even just your home
or a single room.

267
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,970
When you're done, share your map
with friends

268
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,139
and see if they can recognize
what you included

269
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,574
and what you left out.

270
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,375
It's a great way to connect
to a tradition

271
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,679
that goes back thousands
of years.

272
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,014
- Hey, Cat?

273
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,083
I think I need your help.

274
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,819
Yeah, I'm still pretty lost.

275
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,388
Hmm.
