1
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,666
The whole idea of

2
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,302
hydroponics stems from the idea
that the climate is changing.

3
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,437
So, you know, people are being

4
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,572
forced to farm in new and

5
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,040
progressive ways using more

6
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,342
science and technology

7
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,492
I've always grown up in nature.

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,127
So I just,
I want to preserve it

9
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,862
for the future.
