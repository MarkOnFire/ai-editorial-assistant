00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:06,333
- Welcome to
<i>University Place Presents.</i>

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,083
I'm Norman Gilliland.

4
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,999
The American dream
for many of us,

5
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:13,542
it has come to mean
home ownership

6
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:18,999
in a safe and prosperous place
such as the suburbs.

7
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:20,999
But what has that American dream

8
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,834
come to mean
for the First Americans?

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,542
My guest is Kasey Keeler,

10
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:31,208
Professor of American Indian
and Indigenous Studies

11
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,625
at the UW-Madison,
and author of the book

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,792
<i>American Indians
and the American Dream,</i>

13
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:39,875
published in 2023 by the
University of Minnesota Press.

14
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,375
Welcome to
<i>University Place Presents.</i>

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,375
- Thank you for having me.

16
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,917
I look forward
to being here today.

17
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:47,750
- Let's first get into
your origins a little bit,

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,999
and that will give us some idea
of your point of view

19
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,999
on the things that
we'll be talking about.

20
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,500
- Yeah, so the book,

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,834
<i>American Indians
 and the American Dream</i>

22
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:01,792
is really an autoethnography,
meaning that its formation

23
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,375
and the way it took shape
and unfolded

24
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,583
is really a self-reflection
on my own origins or upbringing

25
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:11,709
and how my own family
accessed suburbanization

26
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,375
and home ownership
in particular.

27
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,917
So I grew up...

28
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:16,999
Well, I should backtrack
a little bit.

29
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:22,000
I was born in southeastern
Oklahoma in Hugo, Oklahoma

30
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,875
in the early 1980s.

31
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,166
And from there,
my family came to Minnesota.

32
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,458
And we were renters
in the 1980s.

33
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,041
It was my mom, my dad,
my sister and I.

34
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,999
And of course, my family,

35
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:37,000
my parents in particular had
the goal of becoming homeowners

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,667
in that timeframe.

37
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,417
So my parents rented for a while

38
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,000
and then were able
to access home ownership

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,999
by the late 1980s in a suburb
north of Minneapolis

40
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,999
along the Mississippi River
called Coon Rapids.

41
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,250
And that's where I was raised

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,291
from about kindergarten
through 12th grade.

43
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,000
- Coming from Oklahoma
though originally?

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,083
- Yes.

45
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,458
- Sometimes earlier known

46
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,500
as Indian Territory.
- Yes.

47
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,999
- And what was the
environment there?

48
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,999
- Yeah, so the place where
we lived in Hugo, Oklahoma

49
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,750
was very rural,
small southern community.

50
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,208
And I have few memories

51
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,999
because I was so young
living there.

52
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,625
But interestingly,

53
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,999
I had the first opportunity
to return to Oklahoma

54
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,875
earlier this spring in April.

55
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,583
I returned to Oklahoma
to Tahlequah

56
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,959
to give a keynote address.

57
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:26,667
And it was the first time

58
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:30,625
I had been to Oklahoma
in 20 years, almost to the day.

59
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,125
And you know,

60
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:35,333
with so much history having
evolved in those 20 years,

61
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:39,583
I really returned and did
a lot of self-reflection

62
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,375
about the history of Oklahoma
as Indian Territory.

63
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:48,999
What does it mean that my
grandma grew up in Oklahoma,

64
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,625
that I was born in Oklahoma?

65
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,375
How did my family
end up in Oklahoma

66
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,333
as Native people
in the first place?

67
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,875
And thinking about histories
of removal,

68
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,333
American Indian removal.

69
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:03,166
My grandmother was Potawatomi,
and her community,

70
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:07,999
they were removed from the
southern shores of Lake Michigan

71
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,291
and forced
into Indian Territory,

72
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,583
present-day Oklahoma.

73
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,583
So knowing that history
so much more well

74
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,709
as an adult, as a professor,
as a scholar,

75
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,166
I really took that time when I
returned to Oklahoma in April

76
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,125
to think about that history.

77
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,959
And me almost
returning to a home,

78
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,999
though it's not a place I have
lived in quite some time.

79
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:34,333
- Would your parents have had
some ancestral connection to,

80
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,500
I mean, Potawatomi, Michigan,
not Wisconsin, not Minnesota.

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,083
But would they have a sense
of homecoming nonetheless,

82
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,999
coming from Oklahoma?

83
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,792
- Yeah, that's something that
I think about too is homelands

84
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,000
and Indigenous peoples'
connection to place,

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,667
even if they
haven't lived there.

86
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,583
So as I mentioned,
my grandma's Potawatomi

87
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,834
from the southern shores
of Lake Michigan area,

88
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:00,375
so more on the side of
present-day Michigan, Indiana,

89
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,417
before being removed
to Indian Territory.

90
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:07,166
But my grandfather was
Tuolumne Me-Wuk in California,

91
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,667
and that's where my mom
was born and raised as well.

92
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,083
So I think about these places
and these communities,

93
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,959
Potawatomi, Tuolumne Me-Wuk,

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,999
and places that I have never
lived and likely never will,

95
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:25,083
but here I am now today in
Madison in Ho-Chunk homelands,

96
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,999
and being a visitor
in Ho-Chunk homelands,

97
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,041
even as a Native woman.

98
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,792
So I think about that a lot
in my own scholarship

99
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:35,625
is connection to place,
owning property in place,

100
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,333
being a homeowner
here in Madison.

101
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,709
And what does that mean
when Ho-Chunk people

102
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,999
might not have access
to this land either?

103
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:46,959
- And home ownership or the
very concept of ownership

104
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,999
is something that has been said,
in quite blunt terms,

105
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,583
historically
by European Americans

106
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,917
to be something that Native
Americans didn't really have

107
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,999
a concept of land ownership.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

108
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,375
- A generalization at best.

109
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,709
- Right, so these notions
of property

110
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,917
that many of us have today
are very European,

111
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,041
Euro-American in nature.

112
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,542
Thinking that
we can individually own

113
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:19,417
distinct parcels of property
is not an Indigenous concept,

114
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,458
where there is more
of a collective

115
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,875
or shared stewardship
of the land,

116
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,542
a relationship with the land,

117
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,999
versus thinking about land
as property

118
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,417
and something to be owned
and consumed.

119
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:34,083
- But tribal boundaries
nonetheless?

120
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,625
- Yeah, tribal boundaries.

121
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,250
You know, depending
on the timeframe

122
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,542
or year that you're looking at,
you can always find online

123
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,959
a wealth of different maps
that show tribal boundaries,

124
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,583
and those boundaries were
always in a constant state

125
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,999
of flux and shifting,

126
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,250
depending on
intertribal relations

127
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,250
between tribes that
bordered each other

128
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,583
that had to do with resources,

129
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,709
whether it be the fur trade
or fishing

130
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,959
or hunting and seasonal rounds.

131
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,999
Those borders were always kind
of in a constant state of flux.

132
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,041
- Growing up in Coon Rapids,
Minnesota,

133
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:17,625
what sort of sense did you have
of being grounded there?

134
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,999
- Right, so my communities,
the Tuolumne Me-Wuk

135
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,792
and Citizen Potawatomi
are not indigenous

136
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,999
to the present-day state
of Minnesota.

137
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,999
So when I grew up,
the histories that I learned

138
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,875
were of the Dakota
and the Ojibwe peoples,

139
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,083
whose homelands
are in present-day Minnesota.

140
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,875
So those are histories
that I learned,

141
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,875
oftentimes much more
than my own,

142
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,999
because it was where I lived,

143
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,500
it was what I was
surrounded with.

144
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,667
So when we think about
present-day Minnesota today,

145
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,500
the Ojibwe are
generally thought of

146
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,125
as being in the northern part
of the state.

147
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,999
There's seven Ojibwe
reservations

148
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,667
in present-day Minnesota,
and then the Dakota

149
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:55,999
in the southern half
of the state,

150
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,166
where there's four
Dakota communities.

151
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,625
- So as a Native American,

152
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:05,583
a designation that
covers a lot of territory

153
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,999
in both senses of the word,

154
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,999
you might belong to a,

155
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,875
well, one or more
very specific tribes.

156
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,625
But then in a general sense,

157
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,417
what kind of thing
would you share

158
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:23,875
with Native Americans in general
that would make you,

159
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,875
in a sense a guest,
but on the other hand

160
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,333
also someone who belongs
in a certain place.

161
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,458
- Right, so, you know,

162
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,999
today, we're using the term
American Indian,

163
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,083
it's in the title of my book,

164
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,041
but we often hear the term
Native American.

165
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,999
And I like to talk about
American Indian in the sense

166
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,583
that it is a
political designation.

167
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:47,750
It's also a legal designation
that we have seen coming

168
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,208
from the federal government
as well.

169
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,834
So we need to always remember

170
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:55,083
that there are 574
federally-recognized,

171
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,583
distinct tribal nations
across the United States today

172
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,208
that have legal,
political relationships

173
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,417
with the federal government.

174
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:06,667
Collectively, we are often
referred to as American Indian

175
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:09,999
or Native American
because of the similarities

176
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,834
and those legal,
political relationships,

177
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:18,458
but very distinct in terms
of being sovereign entities.

178
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,959
- For an individual
to be at least legally,

179
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,999
in a federal sense, categorized
as a Native American,

180
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:33,166
is there a universal set
of standards?

181
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,999
- No, but there are
common standards.

182
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,375
So as sovereign nations,

183
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,792
the federal government
does leave it up

184
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:44,000
to individual tribal nations
to determine enrollment

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,792
or citizenship criteria.

186
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,999
So often, we see that
based in blood quantum,

187
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,999
which people collectively agree
is a colonial tool

188
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,999
meant to diminish
tribal citizenship.

189
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:01,041
Oftentimes we see blood quantum
criteria benchmarked

190
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:06,208
at one-quarter blood quantum
of that specific tribe.

191
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,834
So we often see blood quantum.

192
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:08,834
In addition to blood quantum,

193
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,208
we see an increasing number
of tribes

194
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,583
move away from that
and towards descent.

195
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,999
So as long as you had
a family member

196
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:21,875
or an ancestor enrolled in a
tribe on a certain tribal roll,

197
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,583
if you can prove
that descendancy,

198
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:30,291
then tribes often allow
descent enrollment that way.

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,458
- We have some
pictures of children.

200
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,792
- Yeah.
- In suburban settings.

201
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,792
And I know that this is
a really interesting,

202
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:41,458
really the brunt of your book
is this phenomenon

203
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,959
of Native Americans
in the suburbs,

204
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,750
which is not something
we ordinarily think of,

205
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,999
so that we might be
slightly familiar

206
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,458
with, say, the Mohawks working

207
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,542
upper levels of New York City
in the building trades,

208
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,999
or of course, all kinds
of rural settings

209
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:59,417
for Native Americans,
but the suburbs, something else.

210
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,999
Again, what kind of phenomenon
is that?

211
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:02,999
How recent is that?

212
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,417
And as we look
at these pictures.

213
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:08,000
- Right, so two answers to that

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,999
is that we have this binary
where we assume

215
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:16,125
that American Indian people
either live on reservation

216
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,166
or they live in
densely-populated urban areas.

217
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,166
So urban Indians in Minneapolis,
urban Indians in Chicago,

218
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,625
urban Indians in the Bay Area,
for example.

219
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,041
In reality, we know
that 70%, over 70%

220
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,999
of Native people
live off reservation,

221
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,999
and that those people
don't exclusively live

222
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:37,999
in urban centers, right?

223
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:41,999
They live in metropolitan areas,
they live in rural areas

224
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,208
outside
of reservation communities,

225
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,333
but increasingly, those people

226
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:50,417
that live off reservation
are living in suburban areas.

227
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,999
So there's that,

228
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:56,166
and a lot of that comes out
of the relocation program

229
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,291
of the mid-20th century

230
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,999
that intentionally moved
American Indian people

231
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,834
off reservation to urban areas.

232
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,917
And over time, American
Indian people have moved out

233
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,999
of those urban areas into more
suburban communities.

234
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,166
- Norman:
Along with everyone else.

235
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,999
- Right,
along with everybody else.

236
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,000
But my argument is
that we also need

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,875
to think about
contemporary suburbs

238
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,625
as historically
Indigenous places.

239
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:21,333
That the suburbs weren't
suddenly created in the 1930s,

240
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,709
'40s, '50s or '60s,

241
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,999
and then somehow American Indian
people arrived to them.

242
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,917
These landscape,
these are landscapes

243
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,375
that American Indian people
have known well

244
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,375
and intimately for centuries.

245
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,999
There may not have always
been long-term encampments,

246
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,208
Indigenous encampments
in modern day,

247
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,041
in contemporary suburbs

248
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,166
or places that we recognize
today as contemporary suburbs.

249
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,333
But these are landscapes
that Indigenous peoples used

250
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,917
for trade, for travel,

251
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:50,125
for diplomatic relationships,
et cetera.

252
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:54,208
- If we look
at the rural settings

253
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,458
for American Indians,

254
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,041
not necessarily
the reservations,

255
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:03,542
but areas that might be
near the reservations,

256
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:08,000
we see a certain
cultural profile.

257
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,999
I mean, it's identifiable
that these people

258
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,458
are all of a certain tribe
perhaps,

259
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,999
but when they're in the suburbs,

260
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,999
is there that same kind
of cohesiveness,

261
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:21,750
or are they just scattered
about and almost anonymous?

262
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,250
- Right, so when we think
about American Indian people

263
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,417
in more rural areas
that are in closer proximity

264
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,375
to tribal reservations,

265
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:36,583
we know that they are, generally
identify with those tribes

266
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,667
that they are in proximity of,
right?

267
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:42,000
So northern Wisconsin,
we would see more people

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,750
that identify as Ojibwe.

269
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,041
In suburban areas,

270
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,208
we know that there
is greater diversity

271
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,999
of the tribal nations
where people come from.

272
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,959
So in the case of my book,
I look at the Twin Cities,

273
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,000
the suburbs of Minneapolis
in particular,

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,041
and through census data,

275
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,333
we know that
American Indian people

276
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,792
who live in the Twin Cities
come from a wide range

277
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:06,999
of tribal backgrounds.

278
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,959
So of course,
there are lots of Ojibwe

279
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,375
and Dakota people whose
homelands are Minnesota,

280
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,959
but there are Indigenous peoples
from Alaska,

281
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,375
from the southwest,
from California, from Oklahoma,

282
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,291
really from all over
the United States,

283
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,750
including Indigenous peoples
of the U.S. territories.

284
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,250
- Well, let's,
before we get into maybe

285
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,500
what might be called
the kind of the trade-off

286
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,999
for Native Americans
living in the suburbs,

287
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,999
let's see how it all
came to be as it is,

288
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,792
because even from what
you're saying, Kasey,

289
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:43,041
it's pretty clear that
there has not been much

290
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:47,999
or any continuous habitation

291
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,917
of the suburbs
by Native Americans,

292
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,959
that this is a fairly
recent phenomenon.

293
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,875
- Right, so thinking
about your question of,

294
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,667
who's living in the suburbs
as Indigenous peoples?

295
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,291
We also need to be cognizant
of the intentional effort

296
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,875
of the federal government to
exclude American Indian people

297
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,000
from suburbs as well.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,333
- I think that too is a story
that hasn't been told.

299
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:13,999
I mean, we're fairly familiar
with the concept of redlining,

300
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,792
so that one ethnic group
or another

301
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,542
who would not be offered

302
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:23,291
or sold housing in a
certain sector of a city,

303
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,834
we're certainly not
familiar with that

304
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,709
in terms of Native Americans.

305
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,875
And in part, I suppose,

306
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,667
because we just didn't
realize that there were

307
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,125
that many Native Americans
that would even

308
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,999
be on the radar
for that kind of thing.

309
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:39,792
- Right, so exclusionary
housing policies are one way

310
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,792
that American Indian people
were excluded

311
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,500
from suburban areas,

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,625
whether it be redlining
or race-based covenants.

313
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,667
But I look even further back

314
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,999
and think about the
Indian wars in particular.

315
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,333
So in the case of Minnesota,
the U.S.-Dakota War,

316
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,583
in which Dakota people
were forcibly exiled,

317
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,917
and very violently so,
from the state of Minnesota

318
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,999
after the U.S.-Dakota War
of 1862,

319
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,625
and they were forced
out of the state

320
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,166
and there was a bounty
put on the heads

321
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,999
of the scalps of Dakota people.

322
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:18,375
And that same year, the U.S.
Homestead Act became law,

323
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,166
and that same land that
Dakota people were forced off of

324
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,875
became open for settlement
for non-Natives.

325
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,750
So those kinds of policies
of the 19th century

326
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,999
kind of shepherded the policies
that we see

327
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,999
of the 20th century as well.

328
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:39,999
- That Dakota War of 1862
is famous

329
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,999
in some not surprisingly
dark ways,

330
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:48,083
as culminating with the
largest mass execution

331
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,041
in this country ever.
- Right, right.

332
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:54,083
So the U.S.-Dakota War is not
a history that is well-known.

333
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,083
It occurred simultaneously
with the U.S. Civil War,

334
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,458
which receives much
more attention,

335
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,041
and understandably so.

336
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,959
But the U.S.-Dakota War
was a six-week war

337
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,792
that unfolded across
present-day southern Minnesota

338
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,500
from late August
through September.

339
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,166
And the result of that war was

340
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:19,041
that Dakota women,
children, and the elderly

341
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,999
were forcibly interned

342
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:23,667
at the military fort,
Fort Snelling,

343
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,667
located at the confluence

344
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,999
of the Minnesota
and Mississippi Rivers, Bdóte,

345
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,083
which is a sacred place
for Dakota people,

346
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,750
in the late fall of 1862
through the spring of 1863,

347
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,750
and Dakota men were held
in Mankato.

348
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,417
And those Dakota men would go on

349
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:45,709
to be put on military trial
for supposed war crimes.

350
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,709
Again, this is happening
at the same time

351
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,083
as the U.S. Civil War.

352
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,792
And these Dakota men were held
on military charges

353
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,750
of murder, rape of white women,

354
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,041
for their involvement
in the war.

355
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:06,000
And ultimately,
38 Dakota men were hanged

356
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,166
in Mankato, Minnesota
the day after Christmas of 1862.

357
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,291
And those orders of hanging
were signed off on

358
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,709
by President Abraham Lincoln.

359
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,667
And that remains
the largest U.S. mass,

360
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:23,041
the largest mass execution
in U.S. history.

361
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,041
In the spring of 1863,
the Dakota people

362
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,999
who remained in Mankato,
the men,

363
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,667
and then the women, children,
and elderly at Fort Snelling,

364
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,999
they were put on steamboats

365
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:36,333
and then shipped,
literally shipped out of state

366
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:40,917
on the Mississippi River
to new reservations

367
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,583
outside of the state.

368
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,125
So this land that we think of

369
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,999
that was really at stake
in the U.S.-Dakota War

370
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,709
is again the same land that
was open for white settlement

371
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:55,125
following the U.S.-Dakota War
through the U.S. Homestead Act.

372
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,500
- That's the big picture,

373
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,417
but you have in your book
some almost surprising,

374
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,709
touching stories
about individuals

375
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:12,999
that pertain to the fact that
not all of those Dakota

376
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,625
left Minnesota.
- Right.

377
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,625
There are well-documented
accounts of Dakota people

378
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,166
that were able to remain
in the state of Minnesota

379
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,375
through hiding or through
their military service

380
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,625
or through their allegiance

381
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,959
to prominent white families
in the state of Minnesota.

382
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,500
So we know that not every
single Dakota person

383
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,999
fled the state of Minnesota
or was exiled from the state,

384
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,125
and that some were able
to remain,

385
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,375
and that over time,
more and more Dakota people

386
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:45,458
came back to their homelands
and built communities.

387
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,083
- Stories about Dakota families

388
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:55,083
or women who actually assisted,
saved some of the,

389
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,999
the European Americans

390
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,500
who were in peril
in this conflict.

391
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,625
- And just like the U.S.
Civil War dividing families,

392
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,999
we saw the same thing
happen in Minnesota

393
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,834
with Dakota families,

394
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:11,250
where we saw allegiance split
between the Dakota community

395
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:18,083
and those also aligning more
with white settlers, right?

396
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,375
So a lot of families were split,

397
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:25,083
and it is a very bitter history
today as well.

398
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,834
- It happened in Wisconsin too
with the Ho-Chunk,

399
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,250
as well as in Minnesota
that one way or the other,

400
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,875
some of these Indians either
didn't leave as you mentioned,

401
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,834
or some of them
came back in, too.

402
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,166
And some of them
passed for white

403
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:45,999
or whatever required them
to go back home.

404
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,917
- And I think
through these stories

405
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:48,709
of those that remained,

406
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:51,125
we can also see the
intimate connections

407
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,583
of Indigenous peoples
to particular places,

408
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,917
either remaining in Minnesota
or making their way back

409
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:02,999
in this really volatile
and violent situation as well.

410
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:06,125
- There is something that
you refer to as the diaspora,

411
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,417
though, the Dakota
from Minnesota.

412
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:09,999
- Right.

413
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:13,375
So when the Dakota were
forced out of Minnesota

414
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,583
at the end of the
U.S.-Dakota War,

415
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,333
we also know many Dakota
voluntarily fled the state.

416
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,417
I don't know if voluntary
is even the right word.

417
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:24,999
They fled the state due
to the certainty of prosecution

418
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,125
if they were to be found out.

419
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,999
So many Dakota people fled
into present-day South Dakota,

420
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,999
North Dakota,
also up into Canada.

421
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,999
So there are Dakota communities
all over North Dakota,

422
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,375
South Dakota,
and into Canada today.

423
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,500
Some of those communities
have individual members

424
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,542
who have tried to come back
to Minnesota,

425
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,333
or they have remained,

426
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,500
but with family and ties
to the state of Minnesota today.

427
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,999
- You also in your book
mentioned certain,

428
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,834
we'll call them
inflection points in,

429
00:20:56,834 --> 00:21:00,542
or turning points
in the progress,

430
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:07,083
the process of Native Americans
returning to the land,

431
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,999
or at least land that
they can associate with,

432
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:11,500
and in particularly the suburbs.

433
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:18,500
So the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862,
fairly isolated chronologically,

434
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,709
but there were other things
ongoing after that

435
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:24,250
that seemed
to have had an impact

436
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,583
on this phenomenon
of suburbanization.

437
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,792
- Yeah, so over time,
we see increasing numbers

438
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,250
of Dakota people in particular
coming back

439
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,375
to the present-day state
of Minnesota,

440
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,999
making their way
to the confluence

441
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,625
of the Minnesota,
Mississippi Rivers, Bdóte,

442
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,959
as a homeland for Dakota people,

443
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:44,458
but also them navigating
federal policy

444
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,709
in order to access land

445
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:50,458
and home ownership in
particular, in their homelands.

446
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,208
Which I think is a really,

447
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,875
I don't even want
to call it a phenomenon,

448
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,500
but again, really underscoring
the significance of place

449
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,917
to Indigenous peoples,

450
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,583
and forcing us to think
about what does it mean

451
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,458
to be Indigenous
to a particular geography

452
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,417
and having access to that.

453
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,417
So in the case of my book,

454
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,750
thinking about what does it mean
to be a Dakota person

455
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,959
and having access to today's
suburban communities.

456
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:19,208
- By the time we get into the
early 20th century, let's see,

457
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:23,458
it's 1920 that American Indians
actually get citizenship?

458
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,417
- 1924.
- Yeah, so.

459
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,875
- So it's just
a hundred years ago.

460
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,999
- Mind-boggling isn't it,
that it took that long.

461
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:30,500
- Right.

462
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,583
- But with that
citizenship, they have

463
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,834
what advantages that
they didn't have before?

464
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:37,917
- So that's almost hard to say

465
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:41,500
because I think a lot of that
citizenship occurs

466
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
in technicality,
it occurs on paper,

467
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,333
but that doesn't mean

468
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,999
that American Indian people
overnight

469
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,000
were suddenly treated
as full and equal citizens.

470
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,999
And we can see a lot
of how they were treated

471
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:55,999
through the housing and home
ownership process in ways

472
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,625
that they were
continuously excluded

473
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,667
despite their full citizenship.

474
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,917
- And of course, this would
vary from place to place

475
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,875
and a little bit
from time to time.

476
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:12,959
But have you seen
in specific covenants

477
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,750
or other policies

478
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,083
exclusions specific
to Native Americans?

479
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:19,625
- Right.

480
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,000
So you know, you mentioned
earlier, redlining.

481
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,250
So we know that American Indian
people were also excluded

482
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,125
in practices of redlining.

483
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,709
There was devaluation
in neighborhoods

484
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,875
that American Indian people
were moving into.

485
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:38,999
But in cases of race-based
exclusion, yes, absolutely

486
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:41,041
American Indian people
were excluded.

487
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,709
Oftentimes the language
in race-based covenants

488
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:51,250
was something like "all persons
not of the Caucasian race."

489
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,208
So basically anybody
that is not white

490
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,583
were excluded
from certain neighborhoods.

491
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,166
In certain cases,
we see the language

492
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,375
of Negro persons being excluded.

493
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,166
There is a court case
that talks about

494
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:11,999
an American Indian man
being excluded from housing,

495
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:15,250
from his home on a
race-based covenant.

496
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,625
And he was a Mohawk Indian
who was also Black.

497
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,875
So that case reached
the Supreme Court.

498
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,333
So race-based covenants
was one way

499
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,250
that American Indian people

500
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,917
were kept out
of certain communities.

501
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,375
And a lot of those
race-based covenants,

502
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,750
they did make exceptions
for hired help

503
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,999
to live in certain properties.

504
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,542
Minnesota, the suburbs
of Minneapolis

505
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,625
has a well-known example
of Edina

506
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:43,834
being one of these towns

507
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,709
where there are
quite a few examples

508
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:46,542
of race-based covenants.

509
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,125
It's known as a sundown town.
- Norman: Yes.

510
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:53,417
- Kasey: And Edina, I've gone
and looked at their records

511
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,667
at the Hennepin County
Government Center

512
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,834
and looked at individual
covenants for the properties.

513
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:01,875
And you can see the
language that was used.

514
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,250
And then I compared
those records

515
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,875
with the United States census,
and was actually able to find

516
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,667
at least one
American Indian woman

517
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,999
who lived in Edina
in the 1930s and 1940s.

518
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:15,750
And indeed, she was a hired help

519
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,417
for a white family in this
country club district of Edina,

520
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,999
where race-based covenants
were very common.

521
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:25,291
- So the general concept
of these sunset rules was,

522
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,291
and they were in all kinds
of parts of the country.

523
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,999
I mean, they had them in Maine
too, for example, in places.

524
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,583
The concept was that,
well, you could work there,

525
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,999
but you couldn't
spend the night.

526
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,083
- Right.
- You couldn't stay over.

527
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,375
- Right, or you could
work for a family

528
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:45,166
and then live in an outbuilding,
not the main residence.

529
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,458
- So...

530
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:54,542
At what point do we see
Indians able actually to

531
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:59,250
buy property in places
that ordinarily,

532
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,208
or that previously
would've been forbidden?

533
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,458
- Right.
- By covenant.

534
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,125
- I think that we saw,

535
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,125
American Indian people
were absolutely accessing

536
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,250
the suburbs in the 1920s,
1930s, and 1940s,

537
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,625
but they were often doing so

538
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,125
by pushing the limits on,
like, what is a suburb, right?

539
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,750
How far out of the city limit?

540
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,917
So places that may have
been much more rural

541
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,959
in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s,

542
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,125
but today are
definitely suburbs.

543
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,999
And we also know that
American Indian people

544
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,709
were kind of passing as white,
right,

545
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,709
not drawing attention
to themselves

546
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:37,999
because home ownership has also
been a tool of assimilation,

547
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,083
and you're able to access
certain properties

548
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,583
and certain geographies
by conforming

549
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,999
to this Euro-American standard.

550
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,750
- Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of interesting

551
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,834
because of course,
we continue to read

552
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:54,375
as the histories are written of,
for example, the schools,

553
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,291
the notorious boarding schools

554
00:26:56,291 --> 00:27:01,083
where Indian children
were forced to assimilate.

555
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:04,542
And yet if you wanted
to move into the suburbs,

556
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,834
and I'm gathering the numbers
are much smaller

557
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,291
than we might have seen
in those schools over the years.

558
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,999
If you wanted to assimilate
into the suburbs,

559
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,166
you would walk the walk
and talk the talk.

560
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:20,999
And who could tell
if you were Mediterranean

561
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,417
or something else
that just happened

562
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,999
to have a certain complexion?

563
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:28,959
- Right, and also increasing
rates of intermarriage

564
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:31,041
where a spouse may be Native

565
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,083
and the other spouse
may be white,

566
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:36,667
and the children then were mixed
and perhaps fairer-skinned

567
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,875
and able to much
more likely to pass.

568
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,999
- Yes, and you do
mention in the book,

569
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:44,166
you have some graphs too,

570
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:49,291
that compares suburban
home ownership

571
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,834
between mixed race
and full blood.

572
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,500
- Kasey: Right,
single-race American Indians.

573
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,291
- Norman: And there's
quite a difference.

574
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,000
- Kasey: Yes, yeah.

575
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,999
- Norman: As the mixed race
have a much better chance

576
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,999
of actually buying that home
in the suburbs.

577
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,500
- Kasey: Right.

578
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,792
- Well, as we get past
citizenship in the '20s

579
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:13,208
into say, The New Deal

580
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:18,208
and FDR and some really
significant legal

581
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:22,291
and, I think, social changes
in the country,

582
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,917
what kind of inflection point
do we see?

583
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,999
I mean, the birth
of what, the FHA,

584
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,625
is that coming at this point?

585
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,917
- So in 1934,
we saw the passage

586
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,999
of the
Indian Reorganization Act,

587
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,709
almost simultaneously
with the creation

588
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,834
of the Federal Housing
Administration, the FHA.

589
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,375
And so I look at these
two policies

590
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,542
and their duality
of when they're occurring,

591
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,125
and what they are meant
to support

592
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:51,625
in terms of American Indian
autonomy and sovereignty.

593
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,333
And then FHA in terms
of access to housing

594
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,125
and home ownership
for Americans broadly,

595
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:03,583
of which American Indians
are also Americans, right?

596
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:07,250
- So, this is an improvement?

597
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:08,458
- We would think so,

598
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,208
but as we mentioned,
as we previously discussed,

599
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,999
we know that American Indian
people were excluded

600
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,959
from accessing certain
properties and home ownership

601
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,999
through policies like redlining,
and also race-based covenants,

602
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:25,542
which were really at a height
in the 1930s and 1940s.

603
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:28,417
- That's true; I guess
as you get into the 1920s,

604
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,125
certainly you start
to see, you know,

605
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,583
Ku Klux Klan on the rise
and that kind of thing.

606
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,291
And so some limitations there,

607
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,875
but did this
trigger court cases?

608
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:40,917
- It did.

609
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:41,875
I wouldn't say that
American Indians

610
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:46,875
were often always the focal
point of those court cases.

611
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:48,999
The courts ultimately said

612
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:53,000
that race-based covenants
are not enforceable,

613
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,999
but they were on the books,
and you can't...

614
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,291
You can't make somebody
not be racist, right,

615
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,792
even if the courts
say that you're not able

616
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,625
to enforce certain policies.

617
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,709
So we know that
they still operated,

618
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,834
race-based covenants
still operated.

619
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:12,333
People chose who they wanted
to sell their home to,

620
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,250
often based on race.

621
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,709
If there were multiple buyers
inquiring,

622
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,333
one was Native, one was not,

623
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,375
we can assume that homes
were often sold

624
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,417
to the non-Native buyers.

625
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:24,291
- That would've been a harder
thing, I think, to track,

626
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,792
if there was a choice,

627
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,041
but if you suddenly
saw a pattern.

628
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:29,999
- Kasey: Right.

629
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:32,208
- What about the prices, though?

630
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,083
Native Americans, did they have,

631
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,999
as they're moving
into the suburbs,

632
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,959
presumably with jobs,

633
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:43,792
would they have had the
same income to support,

634
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:47,999
to buy and support a house
in the suburbs as others?

635
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:49,500
- Yeah, oftentimes they did.

636
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,999
So in the mid-20th century,

637
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,375
we saw the American Indian
Relocation Program,

638
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,375
which worked to move
American Indian people

639
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,999
off reservation
into urban areas.

640
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:00,500
And that's kind of happening
simultaneously

641
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,125
with the G.I. Bill
as American Indian

642
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,834
or as Americans are coming back,

643
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,417
American Indian veterans
are coming back

644
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:11,041
from their military service
during World War II.

645
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,999
We see them taking advantage
of the G.I. Bill

646
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,750
and particularly
the home ownership program

647
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,999
of the G.I. Bill.

648
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,333
And we know that
American Indians

649
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,709
who had the same qualifications,

650
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:23,999
whether it be military service
or jobs,

651
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:27,458
did not always receive
the same treatment

652
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,333
when it came to accessing homes

653
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,999
in the suburbs
and home ownership.

654
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:37,999
- And would that be because
these Native Americans returning

655
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,999
would be in a part
of the country

656
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,667
where people were familiar with

657
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:47,375
or had developed a certain
animosity toward them?

658
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,166
I mean, in other words,

659
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,999
if you have a Navajo
moving into Boston,

660
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:55,417
perhaps not as big an issue
as if moving into Albuquerque.

661
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:58,792
- Right, so the way that
the relocation program worked

662
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,999
was that it identified
initially ten urban areas

663
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:03,999
across the country

664
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,208
for American Indian people
to move to

665
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,542
directly from a
reservation community.

666
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:15,417
So over time, there were defacto
relocation destinations as well,

667
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,792
including Minneapolis.

668
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,458
So oftentimes, it was
a matter of proximity.

669
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:22,041
So the relocation destinations
of Chicago

670
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,625
and Minneapolis for example,

671
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,041
saw a lot of American Indian
people come to them

672
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,208
from the Great Lakes regions,

673
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:32,375
from areas of Wisconsin,
northern Minnesota, et cetera.

674
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,542
Sometimes people
from these same geographies

675
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:39,500
would maybe go to California,
to Los Angeles, to the Bay Area,

676
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,125
but they often arrived
to urban areas

677
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,834
with only access
to short-term housing

678
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,834
and not long-term support,

679
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:53,375
or no direct pathway
to home ownership,

680
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,959
which is what we saw
with the G.I. Bill.

681
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,542
So I think that was,
like, the real discrepancy

682
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,375
is that American Indians
didn't have the same access

683
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,125
despite having the
same military service

684
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,417
or the same job qualifications.

685
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,999
- Access, including
maybe a home loan?

686
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,000
- Yes, yes.

687
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,999
So American Indians who were
eligible for the G.I. Bill

688
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:20,834
were oftentimes redirected to
pursue the relocation program.

689
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,875
So again, just like
very surface level,

690
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,667
the G.I. Bill home loan benefit
was just that,

691
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,959
direct access to a home,

692
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:32,999
generally a new home
and generally in a suburb.

693
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:36,125
Whereas the relocation
program provided

694
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:39,500
a one-way bus or a rail ticket
to an urban area

695
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,083
in short-term rental housing.
- Oh, that's a lot--

696
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,333
- And when I say short-term
rental housing,

697
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:50,375
I mean oftentimes a stipend
for two weeks at a YMCA, right?

698
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,500
And we're talking about
American Indian veterans

699
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,458
who had the same military
service in World War II.

700
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:01,458
So part of it was that

701
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,999
these officials,
federal officials in charge

702
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:06,250
of these programs
may not have understood,

703
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,291
but I think that is a
little bit too benevolent.

704
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:12,583
We know that undergirding these
decisions is racism, right?

705
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,041
So American Indian veterans
were told, "Oh, no,

706
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:20,250
"pursue relocation,
the G.I. Bill's not for you.

707
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,667
Take advantage of this instead,"

708
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:25,000
even though they were
starkly different programs

709
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,834
with very different objectives.

710
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,999
- As far as moving
into the suburbs

711
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:37,333
by Native Americans,
do we see any kind of, like,

712
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,333
group effort to move
into the suburbs,

713
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,792
or is this just individual cases
just scattered

714
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,875
that wouldn't even be aware
of each other?

715
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,375
- I would say that
it was pretty individual.

716
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:54,041
There have not been large
efforts of multiple groups

717
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:57,875
of families to move
to individual suburbs together.

718
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:04,999
But we did see in the 1970s,
1960s, late 1960s, 1970s,

719
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,667
is collectively,
American Indians coming together

720
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:11,000
in multiple urban areas
across the United States

721
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,999
and working to access housing
that way.

722
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:16,583
So one example
is Little Earth in Minneapolis,

723
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:20,250
where there was a great need
for affordable

724
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,500
and culturally-relevant housing
for American Indian people

725
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,999
who had made their way
to Minneapolis,

726
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,291
oftentimes through the
relocation program,

727
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,125
but did not have access
to long-term housing,

728
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,709
whether that be rental housing
or home ownership.

729
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,999
So we saw the creation
of Little Earth,

730
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:39,999
which remains the only
American Indian preference,

731
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:44,166
low-income housing complex
in the United States today.

732
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,999
And that opened in 1973,

733
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:50,000
largely as a result
of American Indian activism,

734
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,999
and the push for housing

735
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,083
for American Indian people
in the city.

736
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:57,375
- Is there such a thing
as a planned community

737
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,834
for Native Americans?

738
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,583
- Yeah.
- Is that what we would see?

739
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,417
- I mean, in many ways,
it was a planned community

740
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:06,542
with American Indian people
having input

741
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,125
in what Little Earth
would offer in terms

742
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,792
of the units available
and who would have access to it,

743
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:15,333
and also the leadership
of Little Earth

744
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,999
in the early years as well.

745
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:24,000
- You mentioned, let's say
culturally suitable planning

746
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,417
for a place like Little Earth.

747
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,291
What did that include?

748
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,583
- Yeah, so the way
I think about

749
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,875
culturally-relevant housing

750
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,291
are the services that
the communities provide.

751
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:38,792
So access, or in close proximity
to places

752
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:42,291
that provide access
to health care, for example,

753
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,333
education
for American Indian people.

754
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,208
That can include
language revitalization,

755
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:52,792
courses on culture and
cultural teachings for youth,

756
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,208
but also for adults,

757
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:58,959
and different support services
for elders as well.

758
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,750
- Well, that ties
into a question

759
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,625
I was mentioning earlier

760
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,667
that we would get to, and that
is in moving to the suburbs,

761
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,208
now, Little Earth seems to be
quite the exception where,

762
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,999
there's culture, not only
preserved, but rejuvenated.

763
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,999
- Right.
- But for the great majority

764
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:20,999
of these Native Americans
moving into the suburbs

765
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:25,917
from what might be called
home territory,

766
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:26,999
what are they giving up?

767
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,542
- Mm-hmm, like,
what's the trade-off?

768
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,208
- Yes, they're
totally assimilating

769
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,250
into the white way of life.

770
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,999
- Right, well, I wouldn't say
they're totally assimilating.

771
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,959
I would say many of them
are working

772
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:41,166
to retain their
American Indian identity,

773
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,041
but also navigating
home ownership.

774
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,999
And what does it mean to move
to a predominantly white suburb?

775
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,041
One way that a lot
of American Indian people

776
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:52,583
who have moved to the suburbs,
I think are able to do that,

777
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:56,667
are through really rich American
Indian education programs,

778
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,999
which exist at the
K through 12 level.

779
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:02,083
So a lot
of American Indian youth

780
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,333
participate in these programs

781
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,999
that are provided
through the school district

782
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,291
through federal funding.

783
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,083
So that's one way.

784
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,999
But a lot of American Indians
who live in suburbs today,

785
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,500
and this has been the case,
you know,

786
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,583
over the last 50, 75 years
when we've seen the growth

787
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,500
of an American Indian population
in suburbs,

788
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,999
is that many also retain their
ties to a tribal community.

789
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,458
So again, in the case
of Minneapolis,

790
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,999
Ojibwe communities,
you know, are an hour,

791
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,959
two hours, three hours north
of the Twin Cities,

792
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:35,041
and the Twin Cities really
are home to Dakota communities.

793
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:39,542
And there's multiple
Dakota tribal communities

794
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:40,999
within the Twin Cities
themselves.

795
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:45,999
For example, the
Shakopee Mdewakanton community

796
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,291
right there in the Twin Cities

797
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,999
and Prairie Island,
maybe a half hour, 45 minutes

798
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,083
outside of Minneapolis as well.

799
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,542
- Well, I realize
as you've already said, Kasey,

800
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,417
that obviously there's
a lot of mixing,

801
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,625
just a lot of mixing in the
American population in general,

802
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,999
and that would include
Native Americans.

803
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:06,542
But if you have an Ojibwe
moving into a Potawatomi

804
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:14,291
or some other tribal area,
is there general acceptance?

805
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,667
- Yeah, we see a lot

806
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:18,458
of intertribal relationships
these days.

807
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,166
And I say relationships
very broadly.

808
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,667
So intertribal relations
are very common.

809
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,834
And we see the growth of places

810
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,875
like Indian centers
are very common

811
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,208
across the United States
at urban areas

812
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,709
that facilitate
community building,

813
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,208
really intertribal
community building

814
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,417
across urban
and suburban landscapes

815
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,625
because we know
that we don't always

816
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,375
get to pick where we live.

817
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,083
We often move
because of our jobs

818
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,458
or where we have access
to housing,

819
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:54,291
and that may not match up
with where our homelands are.

820
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,999
Also recognizing the way
history has informed that

821
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:57,999
and how many Native people

822
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:01,417
have been removed
from their homelands.

823
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:05,417
- First of all,
this image fascinates me

824
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,166
of this one community here.

825
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:07,999
What are we seeing?

826
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:11,792
- So this is the Little Earth
community in Minneapolis.

827
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,750
So it's several blocks
over south Minneapolis

828
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,999
in the Phillips neighborhood.

829
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,667
And the Little Earth housing
complex is really adjacent

830
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,166
to the American Indian
cultural corridor

831
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,500
or the Franklin neighborhood.

832
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,750
So blocks from this neighborhood
are these community services,

833
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,999
intentionally designed
for American Indian people.

834
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:35,875
So in close proximity, walking
distance to Little Earth

835
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,083
is the Minneapolis
Indian Center,

836
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,500
the Indian Health Board
in Minneapolis.

837
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,208
Today, there's a number
of cafés, coffee shops.

838
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,125
There's a housing complex

839
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,875
owned and operated
by the Red Lake Nation.

840
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:52,792
So really, Little Earth has
become kind of a cornerstone

841
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:56,500
of the American Indian community
in Minneapolis,

842
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,792
from the 1960s onward to today.

843
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,458
- Maybe an irrelevant question,

844
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,999
but do you have a sense
of how many Native Americans

845
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,709
are what we would call
full-blooded

846
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:09,709
as opposed to half maybe,
or less?

847
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:11,625
- I don't, and I would say

848
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,625
that is also a hard question
to answer

849
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,999
because some of the best records
that we have

850
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,500
are from the United States
census,

851
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,999
where people self-identify.
- Norman: Uh-huh.

852
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:26,333
- So there's a big margin
of how people self-identify.

853
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,667
Other than that, tribes
have really good records

854
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:34,875
on people's level
of full-bloodedness or not.

855
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,417
But those are not
overly accessible

856
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:41,542
because tribes are really
working to protect their data

857
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,375
and their data sovereignty.

858
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,999
- I also have to ask a question
about the effect

859
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:50,999
that casinos have had
on suburban home ownership.

860
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:54,333
- Right, so I think today
when we think about suburbs

861
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,750
or when we think
about American Indians,

862
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,125
we think about them
living on reservations

863
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,208
or in urban areas.

864
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,875
But another really common topic

865
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:03,041
that we think about
are casinos, right?

866
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:07,333
And this notion of rich Indians
because of tribal gaming

867
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,500
or tribal proceeds.

868
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,583
I would say in reality,
very, very few tribal nations

869
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:16,583
have accessed wealth
through gaming.

870
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:16,999
- Really?

871
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:22,250
- By far, most tribal nations
who engage in tribal gaming

872
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,375
through casinos break even.

873
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:29,999
They make enough profit
to pay the employees

874
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:30,999
who work there.

875
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:35,333
Very few tribal nations
who engage in tribal gaming

876
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:39,625
generate enough revenue to do
these per capita payments,

877
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,291
where we have this idea
of rich Indians.

878
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,875
So...

879
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,959
Those tribal nations
who engage and break even

880
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,709
in terms of paying
their employees,

881
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,999
many times, these employees
are American Indians.

882
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:57,792
It's a way to provide support
for their citizenry.

883
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,041
But we also know
a lot of employees

884
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:02,458
at tribal gaming facilities
are non-Native.

885
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,083
So it's oftentimes just good

886
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,792
for the economic development
in general.

887
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:10,875
But where we see tribal gaming
being very successful,

888
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:15,999
I would say absolutely
it has encouraged

889
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,834
and supported
American Indian people

890
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:20,375
accessing housing
and home ownership

891
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:24,750
where they may not have been
able to otherwise.

892
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,999
- And those Native Americans
who are actually

893
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:28,999
employed by the casino?

894
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,166
- Both.

895
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:34,999
So for the very
few tribal nations

896
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:36,375
who are extremely successful

897
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,250
and are able to do
per capita payments,

898
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:44,125
that is kind of across the board
for enrolled tribal citizens.

899
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,875
- So it doesn't really,
it hasn't really had

900
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,999
that big an effect
on home ownership?

901
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:54,583
It's more like just kind of
a get by sort of wage

902
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,917
that these workers make
at the casinos,

903
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,583
and they don't have to be
Native Americans?

904
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,000
- Right, so I think these
are two different things.

905
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,041
So, for tribes that
operate tribal gaming,

906
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,542
they support the community,
broadly speaking.

907
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:12,917
They support the employer,
the employees,

908
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,750
and those employees could be
Native or not Native,

909
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,417
and they can pay them
sustainable wages for them

910
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,583
to access home ownership

911
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,583
if that's something
they choose to do.

912
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,999
But on the other end
of the spectrum are the tribes

913
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:30,333
that have been extremely
successful in gaming,

914
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,875
and they have generated
enough revenue

915
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,125
to do per capita payments.

916
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:35,999
And those
are for tribal citizens,

917
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:39,709
whether or not they are employed
by the tribe or not.

918
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:42,417
There haven't been any studies
that I'm aware of

919
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:46,999
that have tracked tribal
gaming's impact on housing.

920
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:50,999
But we can generally assume
the more income a person has,

921
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,667
including
an American Indian person,

922
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:58,041
then the more likely they are
able to access home ownership.

923
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,250
- There are some
other images that you,

924
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,959
that you raise
having to do with,

925
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:04,999
we'll just call it Native
American culture in general,

926
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:08,542
since not all Native American
tribes had teepees,

927
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:09,999
for example.
- Kasey: Right.

928
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,000
- And some of these things
become for,

929
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,999
certainly for the rest of us,

930
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:20,667
symbolic of the whole Native
American culture, I suppose.

931
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:26,750
Is there a sense of
kind of being patronizing

932
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:29,000
when we see these things,
do you think?

933
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,999
- Like teepees?
- Mm-hmm, yes.

934
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:35,542
- I think it depends on how
they're being used, right?

935
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:38,041
So in the image that
we're seeing right now,

936
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,375
this is of the Minneapolis
American Indian Center,

937
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,625
which opened at this
kind of height

938
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:47,417
of an American Indian
population growth in Minneapolis

939
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:49,000
in the late 1960s and 1970s.

940
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,999
And it was there
to serve a purpose.

941
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,999
It was a community-building
institution,

942
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:57,750
and it was just
revitalized, updated,

943
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,999
renovated over the
last year or so

944
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:02,999
and just reopened
this past spring.

945
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:06,500
So in this regard,
a teepee was brought in.

946
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,291
Dakota people have
traditionally lived in tepees,

947
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:11,667
so it did make sense,

948
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:14,999
but we often see tepees
as becoming representative

949
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:16,875
of American Indians as a whole.

950
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,709
So there's this kind of
slippery slope, right?

951
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:23,125
I began by saying there's 574
federally-recognized tribes.

952
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,792
Only a small portion of them
actually lived in teepees,

953
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,709
but we know that
teepees have come

954
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:31,208
to represent
American Indian people.

955
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:36,083
- This whole trend that you
write about in your book,

956
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,500
is that ramping up?

957
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,999
Is it, are we going to be seeing
Native American neighborhoods,

958
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:46,417
or have we seen them already
in the suburbs?

959
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:50,333
- I mean, it would be great
if we saw more.

960
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:54,083
I think there are
particular communities

961
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,333
that have higher rates

962
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:58,625
of American Indian residence
than others,

963
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,792
but I think that just has to do
kind of with word of mouth

964
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:05,125
and people moving to areas
where they're familiar with,

965
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:05,999
where they have family,

966
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:08,000
where they have
kinship relationships,

967
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,750
rather than actual intent
of developers in suburban areas.

968
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,583
- With the federal housing
rules, I assume,

969
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:22,875
especially, like, by the time
we get into the LBJ era

970
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:26,250
where things changed
so quickly in the 1960s

971
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,500
and into the '70s,

972
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,208
has the whole redlining
situation pretty much gone away,

973
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:32,999
so far as we can tell?

974
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:35,999
Is there no restriction
on where Native Americans

975
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,999
might buy property
if they have the money?

976
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:41,458
- Right, so there are
fewer restrictions,

977
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,125
de facto restrictions,
on where American Indian people

978
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:46,667
can access housing
or home ownership.

979
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:50,999
But we see increased
restrictions on how funding

980
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:53,875
for American Indian housing
can be used.

981
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:57,083
And oftentimes, those decisions
are left to tribes,

982
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:57,875
and rightly so,

983
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,625
because they are politically
sovereign entities.

984
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:04,709
So sometimes we see money
that is earmarked

985
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:06,999
for tribal nations for housing

986
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:09,875
being limited
to on-reservation use.

987
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,999
But again,
what happens when over 70%

988
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:14,625
of the population
lives off reservation?

989
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,834
And we know that federal funding

990
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:18,542
for American Indian housing
is already limited.

991
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:22,041
So that's one of the problems
that we see today.

992
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,417
And then what happens
in a place like Minneapolis,

993
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:27,999
for example, that is very
intertribal in nature,

994
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,999
where we see a place
like Little Earth

995
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:32,166
that is predominantly
American Indian,

996
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:37,000
lack access to federal funding
because it is off reservation

997
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,709
and it is not a tribal entity.

998
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,375
So these are some
of the problems

999
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,667
that tribes deal with today,

1000
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:47,417
not specific to home ownership,

1001
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:51,542
but in terms of affordable
housing for its tribal members.

1002
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,500
What do you do when
those tribal members

1003
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,667
live off reservation?

1004
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,583
- Is that something,
do you think,

1005
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,291
to speak for all of the tribes,

1006
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,083
is that something you think
should be changed,

1007
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:05,709
this implied incentive
to stay on the reservation,

1008
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,999
from an economic standpoint?

1009
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:09,999
- I don't know if there
should be an incentive

1010
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:11,583
to stay on the reservation.

1011
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:16,041
When reservations were created
by the federal government,

1012
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,999
primarily in the 19th century,

1013
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:21,999
they were very intentionally
located in oftentimes

1014
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:26,000
remote rural areas where,
at that time even,

1015
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,999
wasn't a whole lot
of economic development,

1016
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:31,999
natural resources, et cetera.

1017
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:33,999
- Except for oil, occasionally.
- Right.

1018
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:36,208
- That's a different story.
- And that's a rarity.

1019
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,625
So we know that remains
the case, right?

1020
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:40,999
So what happens when there are
reservation communities today

1021
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:43,999
that are located in
underdeveloped economic areas,

1022
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:48,250
that are very rural in nature,
not located near an urban area

1023
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,750
where there's increased
job opportunities.

1024
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,792
It's not in the best interests
of tribal nations

1025
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,500
to restrict where
American Indian people

1026
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,083
and their tribal citizens
can live.

1027
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:03,417
I think the better option would
be increased federal funding

1028
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,500
and flexibility
on where federal funds

1029
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,458
can be used off reservation.

1030
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,999
- Another generalization
question here.

1031
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:14,959
Do you have a sense that
Native Americans in the suburbs

1032
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:21,041
are healthier and happier
than those on the reservations?

1033
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:22,166
- I don't know,

1034
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,667
and I'm not sure if I'm
qualified to answer that,

1035
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,999
but I would say
that we could look

1036
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:31,667
at different measures
of socioeconomic status.

1037
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,834
We can look at records

1038
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:39,750
and data on educational
attainment, employment,

1039
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,083
home ownership,
and look at those

1040
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:46,458
and make a choice,
make a decision.

1041
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:47,999
But I don't know,
in terms of somebody's

1042
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:52,583
life satisfaction and happiness,
if somebody's inherently happier

1043
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:55,999
because of if they live
on a reservation

1044
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:57,999
or in a suburban community.

1045
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:00,625
- Stronger sense of culture
on the reservation

1046
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,959
as opposed to in a
suburban community

1047
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,999
and the traditions behind?

1048
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:05,625
- Right.

1049
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:06,999
Absolutely living
on reservation, right?

1050
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:10,125
You have those direct ties
to your tribal community.

1051
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:12,583
But we know that today,
American Indians

1052
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:13,999
who live in suburbs
are also working

1053
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:17,999
to retain those community ties,
cultural ties,

1054
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:19,542
and to build that community.

1055
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:24,417
So often going back
to their tribal community

1056
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:25,500
when they're off reservation,

1057
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,333
but also building that community
where they live today.

1058
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,999
- Norman: Assuming this book
of yours gets wide readership

1059
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:36,417
in let's say, government
circles, administrative circles,

1060
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,041
what effect would you
like it to have?

1061
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,583
- Interesting
you should say that.

1062
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,999
I've recently been invited
to give a talk

1063
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,667
to HUD this winter,
coming up in December.

1064
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,166
And I've been thinking
about that a lot,

1065
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:52,000
knowing that clearly
somebody at HUD has read it

1066
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,834
in order to invite me.

1067
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,125
But what do I want to share?

1068
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,625
What do I want to expand on?

1069
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,999
What do I hope those
who haven't read the book

1070
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,667
but will be listening
to the talk,

1071
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,999
many will be tuning in from
across the country remotely.

1072
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:06,834
What do I want them
to take away?

1073
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:09,875
And I think a lot of that is
what we just talked about,

1074
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:13,208
is recognizing the
historical legacy

1075
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,500
of these really early
housing programs,

1076
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,709
whether that be something
like the U.S.-Dakota War

1077
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:20,041
or the Homestead Act
in the 19th century,

1078
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,750
and how that has shaped
where we are today.

1079
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,542
But the current level of
inflexibility on federal funding

1080
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:30,917
for American Indian housing
and how that has really shaped

1081
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:33,625
where American Indian people
have access to,

1082
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:37,917
and has prohibited
home ownership in many cases

1083
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:38,999
and has really done a disservice

1084
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:42,625
to American Indian economic
success and development,

1085
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:46,750
whether that be on reservation
or off reservation.

1086
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:50,583
- Well, Kasey Keeler, we'll
be looking at the suburbs

1087
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:53,500
with a whole new light
in the years to come,

1088
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,583
thanks in part to your book,

1089
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,999
and it's been a pleasure
