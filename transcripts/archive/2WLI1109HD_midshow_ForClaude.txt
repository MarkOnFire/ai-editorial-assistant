[shimmery music]

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,203
- I am at Yerkes Observatory,

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,172
joining
the Blackbird Creative Lab,

4
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:08,742
who are bringing music
into focus at this cosmic site.

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,911
[guitar swing music]

6
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,046
I caught up with the directors
of the lab,

7
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,648
who are also
founding members

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,785
of the music group "Eighth
Blackbird" to learn more.

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,989
- Lisa Kaplan:
We really started talking
about how can we bring together

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,157
the pieces of
all these different programs

11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:28,128
we've ourselves attended,
to make our own program?

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,131
In 2017, we founded
the Blackbird Creative Lab.

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,334
- Matthew Duvall:
We look back at our struggles,
the mistakes that we made,

14
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,403
and the things that took us
too long to learn.

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,639
We wanted
to create a space

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,075
that serves that demographic
of emerging professionals.

17
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,744
- Angela: Wow,
that's quite a journey,

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,013
from you all as musicians
now creating a space

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,048
for other artists
to engage with.

20
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,950
- Lisa:
It's a very intense program,

21
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,919
and it's designed
to be that way.

22
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,922
We really wanted
to develop the curriculum

23
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,991
to what
the cohort's needs were.

24
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,195
- And they're not asking about,
"How do I compose music

25
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,130
or how do I
play my instrument?"

26
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,399
They're saying,
"How do I manage my finances?

27
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,967
How do I read a contract?"

28
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,736
And this program
is very intentionally

29
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,907
geared toward the whole human
of the emerging artist,

30
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,109
not just performance.

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,445
And even this place,
the Yerkes Observatory,

32
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,847
is a teaching vehicle.

33
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,650
This is an extraordinarily
unique concert hall.

34
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,686
- Lisa: I mean, it's not
even a concert hall.

35
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,854
[Lisa and Angela laughing]

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,222
- Exactly.
- And so, managing sound

37
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,090
in an observatory
is quite different.

38
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,693
- But I think too
that our partnership with Yerkes

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,294
has been so beautiful.

40
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:38,031
We are not creating work
that's in the science field,

41
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,033
which is what
Yerkes is known for,

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,102
but we hope that
we're bringing in folks

43
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:45,572
who are incredibly innovative
in art.

44
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,874
[bright music]

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,109
- Angela: Folks like
composer Julia Moss

46
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,644
and the group "Sputter Box"

47
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,514
are cohorts
of this year's program.

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,917
- Julia Moss:
So I'm writing a piece
called "Growing Pains."

49
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,152
It's about
the mourning process

50
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,023
of sort of growing
and splitting off from

51
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,293
old parts of yourself

52
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:10,664
and how that can be
nostalgic and scary and hard

53
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,168
but also a positive
thing for moving forward.

54
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,936
- That is interesting
and relatable. [laughs]

55
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,271
- Yes. [laughs]

56
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,506
- So, what is it like creating
in this specific space?

57
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,910
- We've really had an open
and vulnerable process here.

58
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,280
I really think that
this piece couldn't have been

59
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,549
what it was
if it wasn't in this space,

60
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,485
together and also
at the Yerkes Observatory

61
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,555
it's so resonant and beautiful.

62
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,723
- Angela: From composition--

63
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,659
- How about we
start from letter J--

64
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,995
- Angela: To practice...
[playing mallets]

65
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,263
...to performance.

66
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,500
[ethereal music,

67
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,770
The Blackbird Creative Lab
offers emerging musicians

68
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,740
an out-of-this-world space
to create and play.
