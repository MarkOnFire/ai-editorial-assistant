1
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,545
There's nothing else like it.

2
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,619
There's a nice

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,052
blue one

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,087
right there.

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,056
That's what we're looking for.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,224
We crush it up,

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,627
shovel it in the furnace,

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,038
It takes about 3,000 pounds

9
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,139
of glass to really cover

10
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,874
the frame

11
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,150
I hope people
get a sense of inspiration

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,053
inspiration from this project.
