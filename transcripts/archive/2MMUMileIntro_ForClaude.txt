2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,308
- Kim Mauthe: Mile of Music is
a all-original music festival

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,177
here in Appleton, Wisconsin.

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,412
It's a free festival
for attendees,

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,983
and it's just a wonderful
weekend of summer fun

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,918
and original music.

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,325
- Ian Thomson: It literally is
a mile long of music,

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,961
and it's all very walkable.

9
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,298
We produce over 200 artists,

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:37,738
playing over 650-plus
sets of music in 35 venues

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,807
over the course
of the four days.

12
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,614
- Dave Willems: It's really a
celebration of original music.

13
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:51,351
Multiple bands,
singer-songwriters,

14
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,355
duos, trios
from around the country,

15
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,760
as well as our
Wisconsin singer-songwriters.

16
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,762
- What makes it different

17
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,630
than other festivals
in the country?

18
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,699
One, again,
the sense of discovery.

19
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,302
It is a developing artists'
music festival.

20
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,903
- Melissa Freeman:
Musicians that you don't know,

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,638
but you should.

22
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,708
- Ben Mulwana: People
from all over the state,

23
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:19,246
people from all over the country
come to Appleton.

24
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,215
- Jeff Gorman: Everywhere
you turn, there's music.

25
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,419
Every street corner,
every bar, in hotel rooms.

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,820
- Andrew Pierson:
You can bounce around,

27
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,322
choose which venue
you wanna go to,

28
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,090
choose which artists
you wanna see.

29
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,925
You make your own plan,
make your own route

30
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,127
throughout Appleton.

31
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,764
- Dave: It's an opportunity
for us to show off

32
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,534
what this community has,
what this one-mile stretch

33
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,202
of our downtown has.

34
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,371
Hence the name
Mile of Music.
