There's something about
connecting with the earth

that's pretty joyful.

- Tommy Byrne: You feel free.

11
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,625
You feel relaxed.

12
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,959
You feel disconnected from,
I would say,

13
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,667
the busyness
of just all the things

14
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,709
in front of you
every day.

15
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,999
- And realize
that some things in life

16

are just much bigger
than we initially thought.

17
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,625
- Tommy Byrne: I think we live
in a culture where it's,

18
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,000
"Pull up your bootstraps,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,959
"and just get it done.

20
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:47,667
And life's hard."

21
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:50,458
And that whole narrative
of "Be tough,"

22
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:54,166
and "The grittier,
the more you go through,

23
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,375
the stronger you are."

24
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,500
And I think it's a lie.
[chuckles]

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,291
I think the strong people are
the ones that are asking help

26
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,625
and the friends
that are standing by them

27
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,333
to give that help

28
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,083
or to point them
in the right direction.

29
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,000
- Tommy Byrne
knows what it means

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,417
to deal with issues
surrounding mental health.

31
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,709
It's a hard trail
to navigate,

32
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,333
especially when the person

33
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,125
whose footsteps
we're told to follow

34
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,583
are lost themselves.

35
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:25,999
- Tommy: I lost a father
to suicide when I was 18,

36
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:29,709
and I compared my own
mental health journey to his

37
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,500
for the longest time, where

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,125
"I wasn't<i>that</i>bad,"
is what I would always say.

39
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,999
And I realized
I was white-knuckling it

40
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,917
through a lot of situations
when I didn't need to be.

41
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:47,291
And I remember vividly

42
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,999
finally reaching
a breaking point

43
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,333
where I knew
I needed support,

44
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,625
and I knew I needed
to ask for help,

45
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,417
and I was scared.

46
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,959
- Tommy helped create
Bigger Than The Trail,

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,750
an organization
that uses trail running

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,000
as a platform
to advocate for mental health.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,375
- Tommy: Bigger Than The Trail

50
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,917
came because
my own mental health journey

51
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,750
and my passion
for trail running.

52
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,750
So, around the time
that I found trail running,

53
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,999
I took my own
mental health serious

54
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:23,125
and got diagnosed
with bipolar

55
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,750
and just, I really had
a support system in my life

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,792
with people, and family,
and friends.

57
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,917
And I knew that some people
didn't have that in their life.

58
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:37,291
And I wanted to find a way to
make sure people felt supported.

59
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,583
- Through running,
the group has helped

60
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,125
over 500 people
across the country

61
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,000
with issues
concerning mental health.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,999
The goal is not to act
as a substitute for therapy

63
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:50,667
or medical attention,

64
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,583
but to serve
as a stepping point

65
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,583
to get
the help needed.

66
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:58,000
- Tommy:
What we really advocate for
for Bigger Than The Trail is,

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,999
as positive
as running is,

68
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:04,750
we want to
also build community

69
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,166
and give people
access to professional support

70
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,999
so that if running
was ever taken away from them,

71
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:14,208
whether injury,
or age, or anything,

72
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,250
they have tools
in their toolbox

73
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,875
to continue to have

74
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,999
healthy mental health
dialogue and conversations.

75
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:25,709
- It's by building community
that Bigger Than The Trail

76
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,917
has created
the most strides.

77
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,625
- Miss Smedemac:
Being able to see the things
that you struggle with

78
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,166
in someone else

79
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,250
and seeing, not only
do they also struggle with it,

80
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,792
but they also succeed.

"and I can do that, too,"

87
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:49,667
and knowing
that they're going to be there

88
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,166
to support you and have
your back is incredible.

[stream babbles briskly]

- Angela: To determine success,

91
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:00,250
you could point to the 1,500
months of free counseling

92
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,250
the group
has provided people.

93
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,875
An incredible feat.

94
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,999
But it's probably not
the best way

95
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,417
to measure their impact.

96
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,959
The best way
is by asking this question:

97
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,875
"What does Tommy Byrne
mean to you?"

98
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,250
- Relena Ribbons:
Tommy changed my life.

99
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,500
I don't know that
I tell him that enough.

100
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,625
But I had some
other traumatic life,

101
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,458
like severe losses
and real grief.

102
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,750
And Tommy's
one of the few people

103
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,375
who made me feel

104
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,417
like it's going to be okay
eventually.

105
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,999
Being able to know
that I could

106
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:35,999
reach out

"Hey, I'm having a really

108

"These things have happened

109
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,834
and had cascading
negative effects on my life."

110
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,166
But they really helped me
to see

00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,333
that it's not
going to be forever.

Tommy is a guy who
I can reach out to any time

114
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,999
and say, "Hey, I need a hand.

"I just need somebody

I need somebody

He's the guy

and tell me
it's going to be okay."

121

We don't have to have
this super connection

to know that I can
always reach out to him.

123

- Tommy: I'm not a person
that wants it to be about me,

124

but it's an important topic,

00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:24,250
and I think that as unique
as I wish my story was,

126
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,792
all of these people have been
affected by mental health,

127
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:29,458
whether it be their selves
or through family or friends,

128
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:34,291
and I think
<i>that</i>is why this is important

129
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:34,999
and why it matters

130
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:39,875
and why it's worth continuing
to fight and put the work in.

131
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,999
So, it does feel good,

132
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:47,333
but it's more the big picture
than how I feel.

133
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,542
- Angela: There are several

some dark,
