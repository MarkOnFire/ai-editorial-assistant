1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,444
Ta Dah!

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,549
I have to smell turpentine

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,417
and have paint on my hands

4
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,520
pretty much every day.

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,521
Otherwise,it feels

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,923
like somethings missing

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,661
kind of ran away with

8
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,396
the carnival

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,636
I've been there ever since,

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,038
which is, I think 37 years

11
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,540
if, you know,

12
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,409
but who's counting? (Laughs)

13
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:47,581
I was able to

14
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,682
do the Sells Floto

15
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,983
ticket wagon

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
I love that wagon.

17
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,286
And I like the Buffalo Bill

18
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,187
wagon.

19
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,288
I just think it's so rewarding

20
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,090
to see people enjoying what I do
