[gentle music]

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,206
- Pete Hardin: Hey, Bertie,
I like you.

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,441
Come on.

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,443
I'm currently 75 years old.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,512
I could've retired
a long time ago.

6
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,547
Who wants some green stuff?

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,415
But I love what I do,

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,986
and I'd like to keep doing it
a few more years.

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm Pete Hardin.

10
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,623
I'm editor/publisher
of <i>The Milkweed,</i>

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,693
which is a monthly
dairy economics report.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,631
<i>The Milkweed</i> is a
12-page publication.

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,702
The intended primary reader
is the dairy farmer.

14
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,404
I love the industry.

15
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,006
I love many of the people in it.

16
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,574
I love the animals.

17
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,309
It's not work.

18
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,646
When I was born, my home county
in New Jersey

19
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,282
had over 4,000 dairy farms.

20
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,218
Everybody in my family
was either a dairy farmer

21
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,520
or an agribusiness person.

22
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,323
I spent a lot of time
on the farm.

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,059
In the mid-'70s,
I pursued a master's degree

24
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,594
in agricultural journalism

25
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,263
from the University
of Wisconsin-Madison.

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,900
I founded <i>The Milkweed</i>
in June of 1979.

27
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,003
Been at it 45 and a half years.

28
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,742
In terms of what gets me up
in the morning,

29
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,312
just, hey, it's another day,

30
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,647
there's another month's issue
looking at us.

31
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,382
Hey, Ed.

32
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,587
We're gonna make that
two columns wide,

33
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,322
crop it as shown.

34
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,759
For the first half of this year,
it's like,

35
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,096
cottage cheese, yogurt,
ice cream,

36
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,866
even fluid milk sales are up.

37
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,970
I've developed my nucleus
of hundreds of sources

38
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,138
in the industry over the years.

39
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,708
It's a lot of, you know,
sustaining

40
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,344
and continuing
personal relationships.

41
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,947
Is your dad still up here?
- Person on phone: Uh, yes.

42
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,549
- Say hi to him for me.

43
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,753
I'm getting a lot of my info
from real people.

44
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:05,192
I may go to Arena Cheese
or other cheese plants,

45
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:11,098
and get the straight scoop from
the owners and the employees.

46
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,066
- Bill Hanson: This is the
cheese curd crew.

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,068
So, they're...
- Okay, they're busy today.

48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,704
- Bill: They're busy today.

49
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,940
- We milk about 200 cows, 220.

50
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,177
- Pete: And I also talk
to a lot of farmers.

51
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,180
All I can say is,
showing a bias,

52
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,749
Jerseys are my favorite,
and these are beautiful.

53
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,717
Beautiful heifers.

54
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,821
There are several kinds
of good stories.

55
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:39,693
There's the nice stories,
and we got tough stories.

56
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:46,433
There's the feature story about
a successful cheese factory

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,269
or a successful dairy farm.

58
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:54,608
Then there are investigative
stories where I like to,

59
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,044
I like to kick butt.

60
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,717
There's virtually zero
investigative reporting

61
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,586
in the dairy press.

62
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,821
How do these
higher cheese prices

63
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,390
affect operations like yours?

64
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,861
- Well, the only...
- Pete: I'm a reporter at heart

65
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,964
with a lot of activist
at heart also.

66
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,201
You gotta get your boots dirty
in this business.

67
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,036
You know, as a
monthly publication,

68
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,239
I have a monthly cycle.

69
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,575
The weeks get progressively
more difficult leading up

70
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:33,647
to the week before printing,
when it's pretty hectic.

71
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,149
The Register Print Center
in Brodhead

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,118
becomes my home away from home

73
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,622
the few days leading up to
finishing the paper each month.

74
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,026
And try to make the flame
as prominent as we can.

75
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,998
The pages, when completed, are
transferred to the printer

76
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,868
up in Madison.
[printing press running]

77
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,939
Within two hours
from the printer

78
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:03,810
receiving the electronic pages,
the paper's done.

79
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,185
We also have email subscribers,

80
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,521
but my principal audience
is the dairy farm family.

81
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,758
They'd rather be able to spill
coffee in the morning

82
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,394
on their reading material.

83
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:27,000
It's an art more than a science,
what I do.

84
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,403
You know, I view
the dairy industry

85
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,006
as having a wonderful story
to tell.

86
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:38,111
It is literally the principal
economic lifeblood of Wisconsin.

87
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,746
It's got pulses.

88
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:44,184
The pulse of milk production,
the pulse of consumer demand,

89
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,821
the pulses of the farmer
and his or her cows,

90
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,257
raising the animal
and then milking it

91
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,359
through its productive lifetime.

92
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,962
It's really intriguing
and complex.

93
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,165
I just think we have a lot more
good story to tell.

94
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,401
I'm not ready to go out
to pasture.

95
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,136
