00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,178
- Jenny Pederson:
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,680
Welcome to today's
History Sandwiched In.

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,483
Thank you, everyone,
for joining us.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,719
To the reason
you are all here today.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,988
A quick note
that opinions expressed today

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,123
are those of the presenter,
and are not necessarily

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,292
those of the
Wisconsin Historical Society

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,095
or the society's employees.

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,598
It is a pleasure to welcome
author and longtime reporter

11
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,667
George Hesselberg,
who is presenting

12
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:37,437
<i>Dead Lines: Slice of Life</i>
<i>from the Obit Beat.</i>

13
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,740
His presentation today

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,442
is based on the book
of the same name,

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,077
published in 2021

16
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,414
through the Wisconsin
Historical Society Press.

17
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,149
Before we hand over
the microphone,

18
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,487
I am excited to share just a
brief biography of our speaker.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,888
George Hesselberg,

20
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,991
author of <i>Dead Lines: Slice</i>
<i>of Life from the Obit Beat,</i>

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,427
was a reporter
for the <i>Wisconsin State Journal</i>

22
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,162
for 43 years.

23
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,964
He covered every beat,

24
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,666
wrote hundreds
of news obituaries

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,901
of the famous
and the not-so-famous,

26
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,337
and was a columnist
for 18 years.

27
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,105
Please join me
in welcoming George

28
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,074
and enjoy the presentation.

29
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,376
[audience applauding]

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,256
- George Hesselberg: To answer
your first question...

31
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,691
I am standing up.

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,759
[audience laughing]

33
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,629
Thank you, Bonnie.

34
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:41,435
Generally, I don't stick
to a script or notes.

35
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,472
I have notes
and they've asked me for them,

36
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,874
and I had to laugh and say,

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,843
"Well, you're not
gonna figure these out."

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,578
But...

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,781
I'm gonna go away
from the script right away

40
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:59,853
because it's October, the week
of Halloween in Madison.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,924
And since this
is a history lecture series,

42
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,961
and since I covered every damn
State Street Halloween

43
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,498
there ever was...
[audience laughing]

44
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,535
...starting in '77,
I thought for the fun of it,

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,504
before we get into dead people,

46
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,773
and animals, and bears,

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,510
and tarantulas,
and dogs, and donkeys,

48
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,382
I would just read a little bit
from Halloween on State Street

49
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:32,486
over the last, since '77,
just because it's History Week,

50
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,088
and this is a history lecture,
darn it.

51
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,158
So, it turns out, in '93,
I wrote,

52
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,162
up until that time,
I wrote a compendium

53
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:46,333
of my favorite times on
State Street during Halloween.

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,537
And before cell phones
and before digital.

55
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:55,209
And what I would do is I'd fill
my pockets with quarters,

56
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,712
and in my other pocket, I'd have
the telephone numbers

57
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,749
of every single telephone booth
up and down State Street,

58
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,719
including the numbers
at the Memorial Union.

59
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,322
And so, I'd go down there
for the first part of the night,

60
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,859
when, just, all hell
was not breaking loose yet.

61
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,095
And then, I'd get back
to the office, the newsroom,

62
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,031
in time to write for the first
and second editions.

63
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,001
And while I was writing for the
first and second editions,

64
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,438
I'd be calling all the phone
booths up and down State Street.

65
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,441
Now, you know you cannot
walk by a ringing telephone.

66
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,642
[audience laughing]

67
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,511
It's just not gonna happen.

68
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,813
So, somebody would walk by
and answer it,

69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,281
and I'd say,
"What's going on now?"

70
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,017
And they'd say,
"Oh, they started burning up

71
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,752
the Red Rock Inn,"
or something like that.

72
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,254
And then, I'd go back,

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,823
and I'd finish writing for the
first and second editions.

74
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,859
Then, I'd get back in my car
and zoom back down,

75
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,128
park behind
by the limnology lab,

76
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,830
and get back up on State Street,

77
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,766
and get enough stuff in time
to write for the final,

78
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,902
which, in those days,
was 2:00 A.M.

79
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,639
And that's how I would cover
State Street on Halloween.

80
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,707
[audience laughing]

81
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,911
Okay, I've been to all of 'em.

82
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,746
I was there when the kid fell

83
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,283
from the roof of McDonald's
and he died.

84
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,554
I was there when someone stole
the keys to the city ambulance.

85
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,025
I was there when someone
took a loaded gun from a cop.

86
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,361
I was there when naked ladies
danced in the windows,

87
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,631
when every State Street
intersection had a bonfire,

88
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,601
and every bonfire had some idiot
trying to run through it

89
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,604
or trying to push somebody
into it.

90
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,373
I was there the year
of the big toga party,

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,077
when the university set up
a big tent over at lot 60

92
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,713
to draw people
away from State Street,

93
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,683
and when buses hauled
sheeted students from Langdon

94
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,451
over to the Toga Festival,

95
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,186
and then they came back
to State Street.

96
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,654
[audience laughing]

97
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,256
I was there when the university

98
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,758
tried to move the whole party
to the Field House,

99
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,328
when the police chief
wore a pig mask,

100
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,298
when a man dressed
as 10-foot female genitalia.

101
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,100
[audience laughing]

102
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,903
I was there when the band
was on the Library Mall,

103
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,105
when the band was on Langdon,

104
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,441
when the band
was on State Street,

105
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,378
when the band was
at the top of Bascom Hill.

106
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,448
I was there when beer was legal,

107
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,451
when beer was legal
only behind a snow fence,

108
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,588
and when police clamped down
and the gutters overflowed

109
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,791
with malt liquor
and cheap schnapps.

110
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,863
I was there when chartered buses
came to State Street,

111
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,199
when the police set up
a command post

112
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,136
in the Historical Society
library building.

113
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,373
When the Wisconsin Student
Association party organizers

114
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,874
took their profits

115
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,943
and they all
went to Smoky's for dinner.

116
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,012
[audience laughing]

117
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,081
I was there
when every single light pole,

118
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,250
every light pole
on State Street,

119
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:54,321
was slathered by the city
with axle grease.

120
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,392
Not by vandals,
but by city employees.

121
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,360
The year before,
the people at Halloween

122
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:05,199
had climbed the poles,
and I remember watching this,

123
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,502
had climbed the poles,
and dangled

124
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,840
like fish at the end
of cane poles from these poles!

125
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,143
They swung over crowds
that filled State Street

126
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,079
until the street
was like a sausage on a grill,

127
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,747
with the skin
eventually bursting

128
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,983
into sizzling squirts
of hot juice.

129
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,485
I was there
for more than a dozen

130
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,154
Running of the Dunderheads.

131
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,157
Does anybody remember what
Running of the Dunderheads was?

132
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:36,463
A crazy, hilarious, happy, sad,
head-shaking exercise in lunacy.

133
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,233
The Running of the Dunderheads,

134
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,469
it happened every Halloween
night on State Street,

135
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,671
at midnight, it would rain

136
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,508
and the dunderheads would start
at the top of the State Street

137
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,044
and run down State Street
in the rain.

138
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,915
Too drunk
to effectively debauch,

139
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,384
the costumed,
uncostumed, decostumed,

140
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,120
and civilian-clad dregs
of the evening

141
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,990
hurdle and stumble
out of control down the street,

142
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:07,127
banging their heads and stubbing
their noses on steps and curbs.

143
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,830
This happens, usually,
right after it starts to rain,

144
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,065
and it will rain,
it really will rain,

145
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,401
it always rained
at least by midnight,

146
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:18,105
when the street was already
filled with broken glass,

147
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:22,743
ripped beer cans,
soggy fake ID cards, cheap wigs,

148
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,381
deflated plastic marital aids,
and every form of footwear.

149
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,783
I've seen too many
Blues Brothers,

150
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,752
too many sets of crayons,

151
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,121
too many humans
dressed as tampons,

152
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,023
too many <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
knockoffs

153
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,691
of wild and crazy guys,

154
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,328
and too many students
dressed as bunnies.

155
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,664
I have seen fishnet stockings

156
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,333
on people who,
on any other day of the year,

157
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,036
would have been arrested for it.

158
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,372
I have seen costumes
so elaborate, so clever,

159
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,674
so animated,

160
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,009
that trick photography
couldn't recreate them

161
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,546
and no one would have believed
even a real picture of them.

162
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,949
I have seen people
so anonymously,

163
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,084
innocently, soberly happy

164
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,787
that halos appeared
above their heads.

165
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,989
Or maybe they were
just dressed that way.

166
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,058
I have seen a mermaid.

167
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:16,096
I was a few feet away when
a student was beaten senseless

168
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,466
by a couple of athletes
who fled like rabbits.

169
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,871
I saw a man dressed as Bud Man
come to that student's rescue,

170
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,374
and I saw a cop kneel, bent over
that unconscious student

171
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,678
with a look of dread
that no mask could disguise.

172
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:35,516
I have seen inhibition-free
night of fun and creativity

173
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,485
evolve into a dangerous,
even deadly,

174
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,888
booze-fed night of nastiness.

175
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,723
I have proclaimed
the night of the dead

176
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,192
to be dead on several occasions,

177
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:49,062
only to see it rise again
with some spark.

178
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,800
I got young, I got old,
and I got young again

179
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,203
watching State Street
on Halloween.

180
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,272
Generally, I would be
leaning against a window

181
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,673
by the Goodwill.

182
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,909
There was a Goodwill on
State Street, in the basement.

183
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,111
I'd be in that alcove, usually.

184
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:07,147
I would always wear
my grandpa's old hunting jacket,

185
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,715
a brown wig,

186
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,986
blue eye shadow, rouge,
bright red lipstick,

187
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,390
and a sprinkling of sequins
in my beard.

188
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,592
I would have a bag of candy,
a pack of smokes,

189
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,027
and a can of Budweiser--

190
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,663
remember, it was a hunting
jacket, so I had lots of room--

191
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,432
in those early days,
in my back pocket,

192
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:30,137
waiting for the rain,
waiting for the dunderheads.

193
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,139
One more, one more short one,

194
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,975
and I won't read
the whole thing I said.

195
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:39,012
It's from November 1, 1986,
one paragraph.

196
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,881
It's the last line.

197
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:47,654
"With halo askew
and underpants clearly visible,

198
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,489
"State Street greeted Halloween

199
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,025
"with a burp and a bump
Friday night.

200
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,261
"For some,
it was just another chance

201
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,998
"to show off some
pretty sophisticated scuba gear.

202
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,068
"There were many,
many female impersonators.

203
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,302
"How many?

204
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,570
"No one knows.

205
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,973
But the figures
were clearly inflated."

206
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,041
[audience laughing]

207
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,945
[audience applauding]

208
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:18,151
Anyway, that's part
of the history of Madison.

209
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,487
And I've been around
a long time,

210
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,723
just covering the history
of Madison,

211
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,959
starting out
as a night cop reporter,

212
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,695
a guy writing
two or three-paragraph briefs

213
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,031
in a newsroom on Carroll Street

214
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:35,402
on Remington typewriters
with triple carbon copies.

215
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,538
And one of my jobs every night

216
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,774
as the youngest one there
was to collect $1.10

217
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,376
from three or four
of the copy editors

218
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,111
and run over to the Shamrock

219
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,480
and buy the Old Milwaukee
six-packs

220
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,483
and come back to the newsroom
and get the damn paper out.

221
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,218
So...

222
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,155
While I did that,
I learned how to write obits.

223
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,524
We were the youngest there,
we were ordered,

224
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,725
our job was to write obits

225
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,894
that were called in
by the funeral homes,

226
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,863
and we were given
specific instructions

227
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,164
on how to write those obits.

228
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,800
They had to be a certain way.

229
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,505
We use that, I use that,

230
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:14,942
as a way to get more
of what I wrote in the paper

231
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
because the orders from Fred,

232
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,512
Fred Kerr,
the night city editor,

233
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,280
the world's greatest
city editor.

234
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,349
He's a tiny guy,
about like that,

235
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,752
had a paper cup of beer
next to him the whole night.

236
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:26,920
And just sipped it.

237
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,789
Anyway.

238
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,357
We...

239
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,361
He said to all of us, young,
college, I was in college,

240
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,463
"If they look at this obit,

241
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,799
"take what the funeral home
says to you,

242
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,734
"go double-check the name
in the morgue,

243
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,337
"see if it lines up
with somebody who's important

244
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,007
"or did something, or is a crook
or anything,

245
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,710
"and if you can get
an extra paragraph or two,

246
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,412
write me a news obit as a side."

247
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,283
So, that was our key
to getting into the paper,

248
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,485
aside from the usual obit.

249
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,656
So, we would look for stuff
that would make it stand out.

250
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,859
And you move from the obit desk
to writing briefs

251
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:10,230
to, in my case, going on as
a cop reporter, crime reporter.

252
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:15,068
And that was where I started
looking for the unusual

253
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,604
in all the stories I reported.

254
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:21,141
And there's, I'll give you
a key to...

255
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,010
People say, "Where did you
get all your stories

256
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,244
over these 40 years?"

257
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,446
Or "Where did you
find out about this?"

258
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,516
In my acknowledgments,
I list people I thank

259
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,985
for helping me out
over the years.

260
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,388
Here's what, you know...

261
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,224
I didn't just roll off
the hay wagon

262
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,525
and start writing obits.

263
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,826
You have to get out there.

264
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,962
You have to write,
and write, and write.

265
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,332
And here are the people
I thanked.

266
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,067
Cops, coroners,

267
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,338
funeral home directors,
investigators, photographers,

268
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,174
deputies, doctors, lawyers.

269
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,445
That was a rolling of the eyes,
that was a rolling of the eyes.

270
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:03,183
Social workers, librarians,
friends of friends,

271
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,352
homeless people--
lots of homeless people--

272
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,720
beat reporters,

273
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,889
and always somebody
who knows somebody

274
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,291
who might know somebody.

275
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,560
That's where
all the stories came from.

276
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,530
And I would work nights on cops.

277
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,834
And in those days, I could walk
into the police station,

278
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,903
go behind the counter,

279
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,606
and they'd have a book
of the calls.

280
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:30,043
They'd also have a container
full of reports of the day.

281
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,614
And since I was alone,
nobody else was doing it.

282
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,215
I'd say, "Can I look
through these reports?"

283
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,017
And they'd say, "Yeah,
look through these reports."

284
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,419
And I'd go through 'em
one by one, by one, by one,

285
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,121
looking
for interesting stories.

286
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,291
And with that, I started my own
column called "Street Scenes"

287
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:48,996
that was in Sundays that
we snuck in on Saturday nights.

288
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,999
Literally snuck in on Saturday
nights when we first started,

289
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,735
because the editors would read
the paper the next day and say,

290
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,104
"Where the hell did
this come from?"

291
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,772
And soon, soon they accepted it.

292
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,577
But I would see somebody died or
there was a death investigation.

293
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:06,280
And usually they're not stories,

294
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,782
but sometimes there's
a little bit more

295
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,918
that you can find out
about that person

296
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,520
that might make it a story
or something interesting.

297
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,157
And I used that
to start writing obits.

298
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,798
I got off the schedule again,
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,367
"There are three deaths.

300
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:31,538
"The first is when
the body ceases to function.

301
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:35,776
"The second is when the body
is consigned to the grave.

302
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:39,913
"The third is that moment,
sometime in the future,

303
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,984
when your name is spoken
for the last time."

304
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,954
That's a quote
from a neuroscientist and author

305
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,956
named David Eagleman.

306
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:52,593
I open with that because
it's that bit,

307
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:59,066
where when your name
is spoken for the last time,

308
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:02,236
that convinced me
to put this book together,

309
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,773
because the people in this book
are not captains of industry,

310
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,442
they're not big politicians.

311
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,312
They didn't give a lot of money
to whatever.

312
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,183
They're what some people might
call ordinary people,

313
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,386
but they really aren't ordinary.

314
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,089
One night, I came home
from my job

315
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:26,093
as a daily newspaper reporter
and my son, Esmond, asked me,

316
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,430
"Pops, did you write
about anybody alive today?"

317
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:34,968
[audience laughing]
And "I'd say, no, not today."

318
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,971
One day, you will die,

319
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:42,476
and few, maybe no one, will know
that you were a good tickler.

320
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:46,346
Or you were that rare
female mechanic on the pit crew

321
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,183
of a Le Mans race car driver.

322
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:54,421
Or you once stood on your hands
in inappropriate places,

323
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,423
dangerous places,

324
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,261
or you love to teach mathematics
to people who hated mathematics,

325
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,264
or your bones probably
will never be identified.

326
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,732
We'll get back to that.

327
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,001
Or you lived on the street,

328
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:12,973
wore a matted old red wig,
and spoke French fluently.

329
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,710
In this book

330
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,214
are stories about the lives
of those dead people,

331
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,882
a few dead animals,

332
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:25,953
one dead tarantula named Eensy,
of course.

333
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,256
These are not words of sorrow.

334
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,159
There are also stories here
about people and animals

335
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,760
who are not dead.

336
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,128
There's two
of my favorite stories.

337
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,330
A guy called me and said,

338
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,832
"George, I'd like
to report I'm not dead."

339
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,601
[audience laughing]

340
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,569
But who were thought to be dead.

341
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:43,770
A cat.

342
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,472
A Vietnam vet.

343
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,708
A man the government was
convinced was dead

344
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,743
but insisted was not.

345
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,413
These stories were written
between 1977--

346
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,383
God, that's a long time ago,
and 2017

347
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,620
for the <i>State Journal</i>
morning daily newspaper.

348
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:04,024
In here is a man who
repaired Jackie Kennedy's shoe.

349
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,460
You know, the great thing
about that obit

350
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,329
of Fauci, the shoe repair guy.

351
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,499
John Kennedy came by

352
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,435
because Jackie had broken a heel
on this shoe and they opened up.

353
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,737
It was a Sunday.

354
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,741
They opened up the repair shop
and he fixed the heel.

355
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,276
They never paid him for it.

356
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,344
[audience laughing]

357
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:28,282
A man who always wanted to be
a great unknown poet.

358
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,583
And he was successful.

359
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,752
[audience laughing]

360
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:37,157
A woman who always ordered
one hot dog at the butcher shop.

361
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,728
A group of retired
touring Illinois chimpanzees

362
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,665
that makes an appearance
when one of its main performers

363
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,367
dies at a final bow in Madison.

364
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,636
Also one of my favorite stories.

365
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:52,406
There's a farmer here who dies,

366
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,442
having talked sparingly
about his days of deprivation

367
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,411
in a German POW camp.

368
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,848
As a general assignment
reporter,

369
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,117
a crime reporter, a columnist,
I got the murders,

370
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,220
I got the mysterious deaths,
and the deaths

371
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,155
that often happen
in the background

372
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,858
and sometimes are pushed
onto the front pages.

373
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,993
It could have been timing
or space

374
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,663
or a well-known man, name,
that moved the story forward.

375
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,466
It's, a lot of times,
it's just a matter of being

376
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,268
in the right place
at the right time.

377
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,971
Aside from being dead,
of course.

378
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,306
Many times, the story is
a breaking story

379
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,776
or a spot news story that is
news because someone died.

380
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,646
It could be a fatal fire,
a traffic accident,

381
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,147
a tornado, a flood.

382
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,417
None of those stories
are in this book.

383
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,119
Instead, these are
the sort of people

384
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,355
who populate any city
or village.

385
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:45,292
They are often quiet lives
of inspiration,

386
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,463
or the sorts of lives that are
seldom recorded beyond birth,

387
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,468
marriage, and death, and a list
of memberships and survivors.

388
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,137
In this book
are stories of people

389
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,841
who populate the periphery
of our own lives,

390
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:05,145
to which they contribute
in a thousand unrecorded ways.

391
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:09,116
Not all of these lives
have happy endings.

392
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,119
The temptation is great.

393
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,021
It is always great for all of us

394
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,224
to tie everything up
in a nice bow.

395
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,861
But that is not the goal
of a news obit.

396
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:24,364
These lives are worthy
of mention

397
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:28,368
because of circumstances or
because a detail or a memory

398
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,839
may have jumped out
and called for attention.

399
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,841
Here are lives we may
have always wondered about.

400
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:38,178
Mysteries sometimes solved,
silences explained.

401
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:42,382
Mixed in are other tales
of immense sadness.

402
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,186
I guarantee I will cry once
in the next half hour.

403
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,921
I guarantee it.

404
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,358
Joyful memories, all connected
in some ways

405
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:54,428
with a topic that brought it
out front: death.

406
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,331
Missed pets,
that beloved tarantula,

407
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,868
a miracle survival that I
still don't believe happened.

408
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,036
The most important criteria

409
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:06,507
for inclusion in this book
is it has to be a good read.

410
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,075
It's gotta be a good read.

411
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,077
So these are all
newspaper stories.

412
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,213
Almost every one,
all but one written on deadline.

413
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,982
In other words, I got the story,

414
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,583
I looked it up,
I checked it out,

415
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,186
I reported it, and I wrote it,
and I was done with it.

416
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,922
So that's
a newspaper story.

417
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,893
And that's why if you get
the book from the library

418
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,594
or wherever,
and you go through this,

419
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,162
you can open it to any page,

420
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,932
the first paragraph
is written

421
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,734
so that you read the rest of it.

422
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,969
In other words,
it's a newspaper story.

423
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,471
We want you to read the story,

424
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:40,207
so we have to get you
in that first paragraph.

425
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:44,111
And I'll read you a couple
that'll show that.

426
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:45,846
Okay.

427
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,748
Someone once pointed out to me

428
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,617
that if you have to point
out irony, it is not.

429
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,352
[audience chuckling]

430
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:57,758
There may or may not be some
of that in these profiles, too.

431
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,263
I am of a mind these stories
about people who died,

432
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,734
obituaries, properly written,
can make you happy, inspire you,

433
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,703
make you want to live
a better life,

434
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,806
look inwards and perhaps be
a little bit more grateful

435
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:16,143
that you are here
and that these people were, too.

436
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,412
Did I write
about anybody alive today?

437
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,614
Well, yeah, all of 'em.

438
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,951
The pandemic...

439
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:31,758
And I have to bring this up here
because that's gets me going.

440
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,360
You don't wanna ask me
in a bar,

441
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:35,596
"What do you think about
the pandemic and obits?"

442
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,197
Because I'll just,

443
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,700
you'll be buying me
beers all night.

444
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,269
The pandemic taught us a lot.

445
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:46,006
Not just about masks
and elbow greetings.

446
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:50,177
It caused the delay or
cancelation of many funerals

447
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,913
or get-togethers
of friends and family.

448
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,149
Those events are where
the stories are told,

449
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,853
the acts of kindness
and folly are recalled,

450
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,956
the memories of sacrifice
and serendipity

451
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,526
brought out one last time.

452
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:09,363
Grudges are revealed
and buried forever.

453
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,899
Missed opportunities
are recounted.

454
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:15,202
Romances are relived
and exaggerated.

455
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:18,705
Trophy bucks are chased away,
or was it a six-pointer

456
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,240
or a ten-pointer?

457
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:24,711
In their temporary absence,
the importance of taking time

458
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:29,783
to pause and reflect
becomes even more apparent.

459
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,986
We must not hurry
past these lives

460
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,690
without noting the little things

461
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:39,159
that set us apart
from one another,

462
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:44,064
or pausing to appreciate
what we all have in common.

463
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:49,269
An important part of the
human existence is sharing it.

464
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,039
That's what I try to do here.

465
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:54,341
So let me share a couple.

466
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:59,413
I know-- oh, I have to say,
I think you already said it.

467
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,881
These are my opinions,

468
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:04,051
not the historical society's
opinions or anybody else's.

469
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:06,286
It's possible my opinion
could be different tomorrow

470
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,688
if you asked me
the same question,

471
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,089
but it would be mine.

472
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,958
So I'm just saying.

473
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,028
All right, ready?

474
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,530
Also, I might jump around
in here

475
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:20,767
if I remember something
that's really fun, okay?

476
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,636
This is Cornelius.

477
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,773
Cornelius, I used to see him
walking around

478
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,977
around Vilas Park
many years ago.

479
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,279
He'd wear a bucket hat,

480
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:34,481
and he didn't have a beard
when I first saw him,

481
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,950
but he'd walk around with
his hands in his pocket slowly,

482
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:39,453
and he would always return
to an old Winnebago

483
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,455
parked outside of Vilas Park.

484
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:45,092
Sometimes he parked it
in a grocery store parking lot.

485
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:48,228
And finally,
I had seen him so often.

486
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:50,697
And this is what's one
of those curious things.

487
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,000
If you see something that
doesn't make sense,

488
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,201
and you're a reporter,

489
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,803
you ask about it
and then you find a story.

490
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,971
Sometimes.

491
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,673
Once I was walking on campus

492
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,644
and I saw all
the UW workers pulling vines

493
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,714
from the--
ivy vines from the science hall,

494
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:10,284
and I said, "Geez, aren't
university buildings

495
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,752
supposed to have vines on it?"

496
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:15,189
So I asked, and they said,
"We're pulling all the vines off

497
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,291
"because the vines have
these tendrils

498
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:19,626
"that grow into the mortar
of these old buildings,

499
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:23,964
"and that expands when it gets
cold and it wrecks the mortar.

500
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,566
So we gotta pull
all the vines off."

501
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,568
It was a good story,
just because I was curious.

502
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,003
Anyway, Cornelius
was walking around,

503
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,072
so I stopped and I said,
"What's the story, Cornelius?

504
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:35,642
You're here all the time
and I see you year after year."

505
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,911
Well, it was, it turned out
to be a great story.

506
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,646
He was retired.

507
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,015
He had his Winnebago,
which was,

508
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:45,652
was held together
with twine and wire.

509
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:50,624
He said, "I drive between here
and Florida.

510
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:53,560
"And I used to live here,
and this is what I do.

511
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,262
"And I walk around
and nobody bothers me

512
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,030
and I don't bother anybody."

513
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:58,966
He's just an interesting guy
to chat with.

514
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:03,370
His father had been an aviator,
barnstorming pilot.

515
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,239
So we talked
and I got some background.

516
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,107
I wrote a little column
about him

517
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,910
'cause he was just
an interesting part

518
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,111
of the background
of our lives.

519
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,279
He was there.

520
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,914
This explains one
of those things.

521
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:16,550
So I kind of kept track of him
over the years.

522
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,586
And he, I got a call
once from Texas

523
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,722
from a hospital saying,
"Do you know a Cornelius?"

524
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:23,423
Yeah, that was the guy.

525
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,960
Anyway, I got a call
from Saint Mary's

526
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,764
because everybody knew him
in that area,

527
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,932
and Saint Mary's saying,

528
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,534
"Well, there's a guy here
who's just died.

529
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,735
You think you may know him?"

530
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,470
I said, "Well,"
and it was Cornelius.

531
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:39,206
So I had a nice chat with
the people over at Saint Mary's.

532
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:43,010
And it turns out when I talked
to him years and years before,

533
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,879
his mom was in the back
of that Winnebago,

534
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:49,149
and she never came out, so
he was just driving her around.

535
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:53,120
And also, of course,
this is the best part.

536
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,756
When he was walking
around Madison

537
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,457
with his hands in his pocket,

538
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:59,293
you know what was
in his pockets?

539
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,460
Walnuts.

540
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:03,997
And he would walk a block
or half a block,

541
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,533
pull a walnut out, drop it,

542
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,603
push it into the ground,
and walk away.

543
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,540
He must have planted thousands
of walnuts

544
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,642
all over Madison in those years.

545
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,145
And that's what
his legacy was for Madison.

546
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,646
And that was Cornelius.

547
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,382
He was just one of those guys.

548
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,818
He was cool.

549
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:27,387
Angel,
anybody know Angel?

550
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,156
Remember her?

551
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:30,557
Angel Richardson.

552
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:34,461
I used to hang on State Street
because as a cop reporter,

553
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:37,931
that was where I got
to know what was happening

554
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,666
part of the time.

555
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:44,638
And during the day,
anyway, I would run into Angel.

556
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,306
You can't see it there.

557
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:51,111
She wore an auburn wig,
same wig for, like, 20 years.

558
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:52,279
She was, like, this tall,

559
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:54,581
and she was over
like a question mark.

560
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,749
I talked to her occasionally.

561
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:57,050
We got...

562
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,286
We just chatted because
street people I talked with.

563
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,088
But I never went
into her background.

564
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:02,956
When I heard that she had died,

565
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:06,293
I started looking into it
and I wrote.

566
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,295
I ended up writing a long,
one of the longest,

567
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:13,400
the longest news obit story
and story I've written ever.

568
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:17,437
Because her story
was almost unbelievable.

569
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,173
She...

570
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,643
[clearing throat]
How to say this.

571
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,111
She had a, she...

572
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:29,983
She was once, her full name was
April Fuller Babcock Richardson.

573
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,019
Fuller, if you know Madison,

574
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:34,988
there's a Fullers Woods over
in Maple Bluff, that Fuller.

575
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:38,492
Babcock,
if you know Madison is Babcock.

576
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,695
Angel was part
of those families.

577
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,664
Before World War II,

578
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,434
she was reportedly in France
with her mother

579
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,337
and was doing some work
for the resistance.

580
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,506
She spoke fluent French.

581
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:57,044
She got married in Madison
and she had twin boys.

582
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,582
After that,
she had postpartum syndrome,

583
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:06,119
which was not a thing then
that they identified.

584
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,988
So they took her boys away
from her

585
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:10,324
and put her in an institution,

586
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,427
and she was told
her boys were dead,

587
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:16,597
and the boys were taken
to the West Coast,

588
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:19,299
and she got
some secretarial jobs.

589
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,502
But that was about all.

590
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,672
She smoked all the time.

591
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,844
And she would go to
the Memorial Library

592
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:33,947
and get a book,
usually a French novel,

593
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,917
and sit there and read the book.

594
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,653
And she would go up
and down State Street,

595
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,522
and she would stop
in the usual places.

596
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,690
She didn't bother anybody.

597
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:49,830
But she wasn't really pleasant,
she wasn't a chatty person,

598
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:54,334
but she was part of that
background of everybody's life.

599
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,504
And the more I tracked her,
after she died,

600
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:00,073
the more interesting she became.

601
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,477
She would, at some times,
she had angels following her.

602
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:06,013
She had angels following her.

603
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,649
There was a social worker
who knew her and who followed.

604
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,851
Who literally followed her.

605
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:13,554
There was another guy who was
on another social work team

606
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,256
who followed her to make sure
she didn't get in trouble.

607
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:17,491
She knew cops,

608
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:19,693
and there were cops
who kept an eye out for her.

609
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,563
Every month, she would walk in
to the front desk

610
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,431
of the Madison Police
Department,

611
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:27,267
go behind the counter
where nobody's allowed,

612
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,804
and walk over to--
what's his name?

613
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,574
Jeff Reno's desk,
Sergeant Reno.

614
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,309
Great guy.

615
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:39,980
She'd open the desk drawer
and there would be a $20 bill,

616
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,583
and she'd take the $20 bill out
and put it in her pocket,

617
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:43,750
and off she'd go.

618
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:46,119
A couple of weeks later,
after she got her check,

619
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,188
she would come back,
go to that drawer,

620
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:51,024
put a $20 bill back in there,
and leave.

621
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,893
And that was Angel.

622
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,663
She was rescued
by all those angels.

623
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,900
She ended up in a nice place
in Sun Prairie,

624
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,469
where she had a sunny place
to smoke and read,

625
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:05,772
and she died quietly there
in 1997.

626
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:09,309
And nobody knew about her
until I wrote about her.

627
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:15,215
And we tracked, with the help
of a Norwegian genealogist,

628
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,484
actually, who was just
a good genealogist,

629
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:21,355
we tracked her sons down
to the West Coast

630
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:28,428
and found a granddaughter,
and connected up that way.

631
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:34,101
And she has a very nice
little stone in Glenview

632
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,572
with Angel Richardson
written on it.

633
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,174
And she, to me,

634
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,944
she was an assignment
made in heaven for me.

635
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,679
She was great.

636
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,882
And there's a full, long story
about her in there.

637
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:51,618
The details of, you know,
I don't wanna go into details

638
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,954
because these are all
different stories.

639
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,689
Mark Maida, 2005,

640
00:30:57,057 --> 00:31:01,962
died in Iraq just before
he was supposed to come home.

641
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,566
I knew his mom and dad.

642
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,035
I know his mom and dad still.

643
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:12,639
I was there in their house
right after they found out.

644
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:16,276
He had just been promoted
to sergeant.

645
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:20,514
And Ray, his dad,
was a police detective.

646
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:26,019
His mom was an emergency child
pediatric cancer nurse at UW.

647
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,056
And I talked to them
right away afterwards.

648
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:32,025
And here's the last paragraph.

649
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,369
"Ray remembered receiving
the news last Thursday night

650
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:44,771
"after he and his wife
and son, Chris,

651
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:47,474
"went out to eat
and listen to an Irish band.

652
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,843
"'It was about 10:00 P.M.

653
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,945
"'and I went into the bedroom
to lie down.

654
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:55,582
"'Diane went to get a book
to read and she said,

655
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:57,551
"'There's a man in uniform
at the front door

656
00:31:57,618 --> 00:31:59,353
"and he asked to talk to both
of us.'

657
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,355
"'The message was brief,

658
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,558
"'the sorrow immediate
and inescapable.

659
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,527
"'I didn't want him to leave.

660
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,162
"'I kept asking him
to please stay here.

661
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,998
"'I kept touching him.

662
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:13,867
I kept grabbing at his coat.'"

663
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,772
[clearing throat]

664
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:24,178
Kenny-- Oh, Cecil Burke,
Cecil Burke, Cecil's Sandals.

665
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,679
The original Cecil's Sandals.

666
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:28,215
The guy who started it all.

667
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,018
Just a really nice guy.

668
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,653
And his legend.

669
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,154
You can't really say legend

670
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:35,756
because that would
be misusing the word

671
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,624
because legends
don't really exist.

672
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:39,393
He was a star.

673
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,397
He and somebody working
with him helped him.

674
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,799
A woman came in and said,
"I want a pair of sandals.

675
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,201
Can you make me one?"

676
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:51,471
He says, "I don't make sandals,
I repair shoes, but okay."

677
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:53,974
So he made a pair of sandals.

678
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,176
The guy working with him
said, "We could find a way

679
00:32:56,243 --> 00:33:00,314
"to attach these cords
and make 'em stay on the feet,

680
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,016
and they look cool,"
and that was the start.

681
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,419
And this woman came back
with 10 more friends.

682
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,189
And that was what started
the Cecil's Sandals.

683
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:14,995
Then Cecil's son took it over
and Cecil became just a star.

684
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,697
And he was the nicest guy.

685
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:19,433
And that was Cecil's Sandals.

686
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,168
He's in here, too.

687
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,337
Kenny Stout.

688
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,808
That's him after he had a wart
removed from his nose,

689
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,444
about that long, that long.

690
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:34,882
Kenny Stout, I met Kenny Stout
the day his mom died

691
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,684
while they were watching
Johnny Carson,

692
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:39,953
and she froze to death

693
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,391
while they were watching Johnny
Carson in their home in Verona.

694
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,593
Their home was in an area

695
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,196
that had nice houses
right off the main drag there,

696
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:51,331
but they didn't have
any walls in this house.

697
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:53,100
It was all falling apart.

698
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,636
They had one electric cord.

699
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,404
It was going to their TV,

700
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:01,441
and they had a little
coal-burning stove

701
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:02,776
which kept them warm.

702
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:05,078
This is in cold weather.

703
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:08,115
And they would watch
Johnny Carson every night

704
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:11,652
with their feet
up against the coal stove.

705
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,620
And they had 23 cats.

706
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:17,090
And she, one night,
she just froze,

707
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:20,294
and they took her to the
hospital and she didn't live.

708
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,263
So I was there
the very next day.

709
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:26,333
And as they say, you know,

710
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,436
if you're not there
and you just see it

711
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:32,005
or you hear or read about it,
you aren't gonna believe it.

712
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,540
You just aren't.

713
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:37,511
But I was there,
I saw the cats, I saw Kenny.

714
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:40,214
I saw the coal stove.

715
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,517
And I saw the single
electric cord.

716
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,420
And the world's greatest
photographer, L. Roger Turner,

717
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:47,688
was there with me.

718
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:52,359
He took, like, a landscape
photograph of this thing.

719
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,194
It was just,
you could count the cats.

720
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,796
It was hilarious,
they're all over like this.

721
00:34:55,863 --> 00:35:00,734
And I talked to Kenny,
who was a little bit challenged.

722
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,970
He's well-known
in the community.

723
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:05,272
He drove a bicycle
with a windscreen on it,

724
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,508
and one year,
he froze part of his nose,

725
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:09,676
so he had this long,
long wart on there.

726
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,778
And he didn't know
what he was gonna do.

727
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:13,547
He was just beside himself.

728
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,717
So I said, "Well,
to hell with this.

729
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:21,288
I'll throw caution, objective
journalism caution to the wind."

730
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,557
And I went from his place
over to Miller's

731
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,860
and bought a bunch of cat food
and a bunch of food for him.

732
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:29,596
Came back, and then we sat down
and chatted.

733
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:33,567
And this photo was taken
a year after that.

734
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:39,506
He had moved into a
boarding house in Verona.

735
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:42,776
We found out that
he had no money.

736
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,345
He had his collection
of silver coins.

737
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:46,613
What is it about old guys

738
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,382
and they're collecting
silver coins?

739
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:51,318
My dad did it,
I'm doing it, it's just...

740
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:53,453
[audience laughing]

741
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,722
Anyway, so we found--

742
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,691
and I got a hold
of a social worker,

743
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:58,859
a Dane County social worker.

744
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:00,594
Another angel.

745
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,864
I know they come in
for grief once in a while,

746
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:09,203
but, boy, they can show up with
wings fluttering sometimes.

747
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:12,639
They found,

748
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:18,579
and I wrote about and found
that Kenny's dad, long dead,

749
00:36:18,645 --> 00:36:22,416
still had part of his
teacher's pension coming to him.

750
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:27,387
So he got that, they sold the
lot, which was derelict,

751
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:33,126
and to pay for the taxes
that he owed.

752
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,362
And he was looking
through the phone book

753
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:38,765
one day in the library,
and he said,

754
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,367
"This looks like
a good place to be."

755
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,769
It was Hawaii, of course.

756
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:44,972
And so he took his money,

757
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,307
he got a bus ticket
to the West Coast.

758
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,910
The bus had an accident
and rolled over on the way,

759
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,411
but he survived.

760
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:54,848
I was keeping track of the guy,
and he got to Hawaii.

761
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,350
And then I lost track of him.

762
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,085
And then he died.

763
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:01,955
Happy, I guess,
because he was working at a job

764
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:07,027
as a park guy doing the lawn,
and was just happy as heck.

765
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,564
He never thought
he'd end up that way, I'm sure.

766
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:12,866
But Kenny was a good guy.

767
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:16,703
And the circumstances
of his mother's death

768
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,438
were not good.

769
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,742
But he got some money,
he got his wart removed.

770
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:24,144
He was happy, so win-win.

771
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,482
This is Oddvar Karlsen.

772
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,352
First time I met Oddvar Karlsen,

773
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,589
I was sitting at his table,
dinner table.

774
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:38,825
He and Gerd in Eidanger, Norway.

775
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,198
And I had been briefed
by his daughter, Elsa,

776
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:48,001
that if I wanted to make
an impression on her dad,

777
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:50,971
I should read both <i>Time</i>
and <i>Newsweek</i> ,

778
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,973
because he's a stonecutter,

779
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,243
but he read both of those
magazines every week.

780
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,544
That week in Oslo,

781
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,947
I picked up copies
of <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> .

782
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:03,450
I read through 'em and
memorized 'em all, and we,

783
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:07,654
and it was the first time
I'd met her parents.

784
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,190
And we're sitting,
I can still see it.

785
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:11,592
I'm sitting there
right to the right.

786
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,160
He was right here,
I'm right there.

787
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,028
And we were sitting there
like that,

788
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:18,432
and I put down my fork
and I said to him,

789
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:21,902
I said, "Well, did you read
in <i>Newsweek</i> this week..."

790
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,637
Oh, it was like,

791
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:27,708
it was like I had just saved
his family, you know?

792
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:32,446
And it was my first meeting with
Oddvar Karlsen, a stonecutter.

793
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:37,951
He had hands like this,
like that, a real stonecutter.

794
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:39,253
He had a one man,

795
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,622
one-and-a-half-man stone
cutting business in Eidanger.

796
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:47,027
His daughter Elsa, who tripped
me and beat me to the floor,

797
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,397
just a wonderful person who
I was married to for many years

798
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:52,699
and is still my
totally best friend.

799
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:56,470
In fact, we just got back
from Italy last week.

800
00:38:56,537 --> 00:39:00,874
So anyway, he was
so influential in teaching me

801
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:06,847
that everybody, you can't
judge people by their looks.

802
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:12,719
And he was a hardworking
ex-seaman worker guy.

803
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:20,093
And he was very self-educated,

804
00:39:21,395 --> 00:39:26,900
and he taught me and our sons
some valuable lessons in life.

805
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,203
He came to Madison once.

806
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,372
I love this story
'cause he's a stone guy.

807
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,374
And I said, well,
"Let's go up to the Capitol,"

808
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:38,111
which of course is filled with
30 kinds of marble, right?

809
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:42,049
And this guy,
he walks into the rotunda.

810
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:46,186
He looks around, and he goes to
one of those big black columns,

811
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:50,724
and he puts his big hands on it
and he says, "Pen stein."

812
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:54,761
"Pen stein,"
which means "beautiful stone."

813
00:39:54,828 --> 00:39:59,800
And these columns were the big,
black, reflective columns

814
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:03,871
that were imported
from Norway back in early 1900

815
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,406
by Magnus Swenson's gang.

816
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:09,943
And I mean gang,
but that's beside the point.

817
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,746
Anyway, he was that kind of guy,
and the last I saw of him,

818
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:15,048
he was teaching me the right way

819
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:19,786
to make a whistle out of a tree,
a tree branch for the boys

820
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:21,188
'cause I was making it
all wrong.

821
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,190
He just took a jackknife
out of his pocket

822
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,192
and hammered on it
and stuff like that.

823
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:27,261
Anyway, he's in here.

824
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:30,564
That's Charlie the cat.

825
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,366
I gotta read you the--
remember I said

826
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,234
you want people to read
what you write,

827
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,637
so you gotta get 'em
in the first paragraph?

828
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:39,173
So that's Charlie, my cat.

829
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:42,042
Charlie, 33.

830
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:46,046
Okay,
here's the first paragraph.

831
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,950
"March 5, 1996.

832
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,054
"It was so warm
a week ago Sunday,

833
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:58,358
I almost buried Charlie,
our frozen pet cat."

834
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,928
Don't you want to read
the rest of that story?

835
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:02,963
[audience laughing]

836
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:07,134
That's my son, Ivan,
and Charlie.

837
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:11,071
Anyway, his obit's in here,
too.

838
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,373
That's Mary Ostrander.

839
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,475
Mary is a fireplug.

840
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,643
She looked like a fireplug.

841
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,579
She was that high
and she was a fireplug.

842
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,814
She was Madison's
first policewoman.

843
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:25,586
She paved the way for every
single policewoman in this town.

844
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:29,456
And when she started,
she was given no...

845
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,961
They gave her no quarter, and
she gave them no quarter back

846
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:36,930
and said, "We deserve this,
we deserve that.

847
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,199
I'll sue you
if you don't do this."

848
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:41,401
And she beat 'em every time.

849
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:42,636
And I met her

850
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:46,106
when I first started
as a rookie cop reporter.

851
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,408
And she was a detective.

852
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:52,913
Before that, they couldn't make
women detectives, of course.

853
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,882
But we got along just great.

854
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,950
Two fireplugs talking
to each other all the time.

855
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,152
And her, when she died,

856
00:41:59,953 --> 00:42:01,288
I'd already talked to her
before that

857
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:05,259
about the cases that she
wished she still could work on

858
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,426
that were never solved.

859
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:09,296
But she was good,
good people.

860
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:10,898
Good cop, too.

861
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:12,533
Okay.

862
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,700
Simon Sparrow.

863
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,636
Anybody recognize him?

864
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,305
One of the great outlier
Madison artists,

865
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,507
but a great outlier artist, too.

866
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:22,676
He could make anything
out of anything.

867
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:25,546
That's one of his artworks
behind him.

868
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:28,415
He was also a street preacher,

869
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:33,854
a concerned man about children,
had opinions very big,

870
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,290
very high, very high opinions
of a lot of things.

871
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:39,126
And he's in here, too,
because he deserves to be here.

872
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:41,295
Good guy, good stuff.

873
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,297
If you can find any
of his stuff, good luck,

874
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:44,798
'cause you'll take you a year

875
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:47,467
just to examine
one of his pieces.

876
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:48,735
He's in here.

877
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:50,470
Chief!

878
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,408
I don't know
where to start with Chief.

879
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:56,243
Some of you may remember him.

880
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,744
He was the main attraction

881
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:01,348
at the Henry Vilas Zoo
for many years.

882
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,750
One day on a Sunday morning,

883
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:06,587
somebody jumped in
to his exhibit,

884
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:09,890
and a cop just happened
to be there.

885
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:15,362
The cop jumped in
and had to shoot Chief dead.

886
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:18,699
And of course,
the cop took all kinds of grief,

887
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:21,668
but he did only what
he could do.

888
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,971
And that was it.

889
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:26,840
Except that I saw this,
and I thought, you know,

890
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,842
I should write Chief's obit.

891
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,277
And he was--

892
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:32,679
And so I did a lot of research
on it.

893
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,081
I tracked down
where he came from.

894
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:36,650
He was a cub in Canada, in fact.

895
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,919
I found out
his transport papers,

896
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:41,788
talked with the people
who knew him.

897
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:43,624
And I use "him" for an animal

898
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,459
because we're not allowed
to do that

899
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:48,262
unless it's got, you have
his name, otherwise it's an it.

900
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:52,599
But anyway, Chief was a him,
he was nobody's teddy bear.

901
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,401
He never was.

902
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:58,705
He was a-- and polar bears
are angry, mean bears.

903
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:00,507
And he was an angry, mean bear.

904
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:03,076
Everybody who knew him
said that.

905
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,546
But he was just being a bear.

906
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:07,314
So he got killed
for being a bear.

907
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:11,185
And I thought that
was a good obit on Chief.

908
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:12,920
He was...

909
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:14,655
He was missed right away.

910
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:17,057
He was missed right away.

911
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:19,960
[chuckling]
Jan Rapacz.

912
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:23,197
This guy used to smuggle
pig organs

913
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:26,934
in the bottoms
of aerosol shaving cream

914
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:30,771
for his research at the UW.

915
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:33,006
People sometimes
don't recognize this,

916
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:37,644
but the UW is full
of incredible, unusual people.

917
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:40,614
I mean...
[audience laughing]

918
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,950
Really, you know, I've been
covering the UW

919
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,519
since I was a student
there in '69, '70.

920
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:49,056
And there are people
you just don't believe exist.

921
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:51,825
They are, they used...
[laughing]

922
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:55,562
But John, Jan, actually,
was an expert.

923
00:44:56,964 --> 00:45:00,434
He's responsible for us knowing
about cholesterol today.

924
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:03,871
He did his research
at Arlington Farms,

925
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:06,240
and he was a really good guy.

926
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,243
I drank wine with him
too many times, I guess,

927
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:11,712
and his wife,
also a great researcher.

928
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:14,815
He found out that pigs are
the way to--

929
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:17,417
their hearts will hold
cholesterol

930
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,820
and you can measure it
and things like that.

931
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:22,289
His background was, he was,

932
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:25,058
he spent a boyhood
in the woods

933
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,728
because the Nazis had taken
over his village,

934
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:31,164
and joined the resistance
there as a child.

935
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,967
His teachers told him he
would never amount to anything,

936
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:36,370
and he proved them wrong,

937
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:39,840
which is almost
a clich? these days.

938
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:42,242
But he,
if you look at him,

939
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:45,312
you know, he's a funny,
happy guy,

940
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:49,750
and he ended up at the UW
and was just a good guy.

941
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:51,518
The one story
I remember about Jan,

942
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,620
I don't think it's in the story,

943
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:55,956
is that one night
I was covering cops, I think,

944
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:59,459
and there was a big fire
out at the Arlington Pig Farm,

945
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:04,598
which is a big research
facility, huge, international.

946
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:09,536
And there are fire departments
all over the place,

947
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,905
and we almost put this
in the paper

948
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:16,176
that at the UW, it was
a day of swine and hoses.

949
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:18,011
[audience laughing]

950
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:19,880
Would that have been great?

951
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,949
[audience laughing]

952
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:27,821
This is Hamlet,
a 95-pound pork-bellied pig.

953
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:33,594
I wrote his obit because
he was the direct competitor

954
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,129
with Jimmy the Groundhog.

955
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,834
Every year, Cottage Grove
would have a dinner for him,

956
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:42,936
and they'd raise money
with breakfast.

957
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,771
It was a hilarious story.

958
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:46,139
His name was Hamlet.

959
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:49,343
He also had a side job as,
you know, when principals say,

960
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,778
"If my students do this,
I'll kiss a pig?"

961
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:53,981
He was the pig.
[audience laughing]

962
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:55,649
That a great,
what a great background.

963
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:57,184
Great background.

964
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,687
So, and then we got
Chimney Skeleton.

965
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:04,691
We all, this was written
a long time ago.

966
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:06,693
I was there
when they found the bones.

967
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,364
Me and Kim Schneider
at the Good'nLoud Music store

968
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,133
on University Avenue,
next to the old Doctor Inn.

969
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,334
Now we're talking history.

970
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,536
Nobody remembers the Doctor Inn.

971
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:17,304
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

972
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:19,439
Anyway, this is
the Smithsonian rendition

973
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:21,708
of what the guy
should have looked at,

974
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:23,410
would have looked like.

975
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:25,412
He was the pile of bones
found at the bottom

976
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:29,016
of the incinerator at
Good'nLoud Music by the owner.

977
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:31,518
And at first, they thought
it was a woman

978
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:32,819
because of the clothing

979
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:36,089
and the brooch
and the shoes and the shift.

980
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:37,891
And then a couple of weeks
later, they said,

981
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,059
"No, this is a guy."

982
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:43,363
And then, ever since then,
and that happened,

983
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:45,899
what year did the
Chimney Skeleton happen?

984
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,634
'82, '81, '82?

985
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:54,041
The thing is, nobody gave
a damn about this guy.

986
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:56,944
They could not find out

987
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,046
who he was,
what he was doing there,

988
00:47:59,112 --> 00:48:02,115
how he got there,
what his background was,

989
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:06,253
how old he was, anything,
because of the circumstances

990
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,723
in which he was found,
and nobody really...

991
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,758
And every year after that,

992
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:15,329
every damn year,
every September,

993
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,497
I would write a column
about this guy

994
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:20,400
and say,
"Who knows who this is?"

995
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:25,939
He's somebody's brother, father,
uncle, son, something.

996
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:28,775
Who is there?

997
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:32,079
This is,
Madison's not a big place.

998
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:36,783
And nobody, and every year, I'd
check with the cold case guys

999
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,519
and nothing.

1000
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:41,588
And DNA things change.

1001
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:46,126
And I finally wrote
an obit for him years later.

1002
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:51,665
But then two years ago now,
last year, they identified him.

1003
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:55,002
But the circumstances
of his death

1004
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,304
are still quite the mystery.

1005
00:48:57,371 --> 00:49:00,741
Who took this body and shoved it
down a pipe that big around?

1006
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:02,476
And why?

1007
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:05,479
Why, what was he doing?

1008
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:11,318
Was he a, what we used to call
then a cross-dresser?

1009
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:13,420
And I don't know, nobody knows.

1010
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:16,023
And then when they
finally identified him,

1011
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,424
one of the reasons it turns out

1012
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:19,826
that they had difficulty
identifying him,

1013
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:23,630
this they just found out,
was because he was adopted.

1014
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:27,201
And so those records
were all screwed up.

1015
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:29,436
And he had had two families,

1016
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:32,940
neither of whom
reported him missing.

1017
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:38,011
So not only was he not missed,
nobody wanted to miss him.

1018
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:41,481
So it's a really,
really sad story.

1019
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:44,952
And I wrote about it lots.

1020
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:48,088
Okay, Casey the chimp.
[laughing]

1021
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:52,192
Casey was part
of a traveling circus,

1022
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:53,727
of course, based in Rockford.

1023
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:57,898
This guy just took his gang
of chimpanzees out on the road

1024
00:49:57,965 --> 00:49:59,766
and would perform.

1025
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:04,505
They'd smoke cigarettes and ride
bicycles and stuff like that.

1026
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:08,909
And finally, one day, the owner
said, "I've had enough.

1027
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:10,911
I don't wanna do this
anymore."

1028
00:50:10,978 --> 00:50:15,148
And he managed to convince
Vilas Park Zoo, Henry Vilas Zoo

1029
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:17,251
to take all his chimpanzees.

1030
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:20,420
So, and of course, he didn't
tell the chimpanzees this.

1031
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:22,723
He brought the chimpanzees
up to Madison,

1032
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:25,592
dropped 'em off,
and that was it.

1033
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,896
Well, it's not the end
of the story.

1034
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:31,832
When Casey, the last of them,
died, I found out about it.

1035
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:33,934
So I started looking
into the background,

1036
00:50:34,001 --> 00:50:36,203
and I found this terrific story.

1037
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,573
It may have been apocryphal,
but I don't know,

1038
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,643
but there were stories
written about it at the time.

1039
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,611
This guy, the Rockford guy,

1040
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:48,682
came back up to Madison
to visit his chimps.

1041
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:53,053
And he walked into the
chimp cage place,

1042
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:56,723
and Casey was standing there,

1043
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,393
and Casey saw him,
and Casey did this--

1044
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,594
This is a true story.

1045
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:03,463
Casey looked at him,
and he did this--

1046
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,532
[audience laughing]

1047
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:11,171
Is that hilarious or what?

1048
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:14,641
And I have, I know we're
running out of time.

1049
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,043
I could do a lot of these,

1050
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:19,446
but I have two I might
tell you about.

1051
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:22,683
One is a long story.

1052
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:23,984
I'll make it short.

1053
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:26,887
There was an accident on
the interstate outside of Tomah,

1054
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:29,656
many years ago,
and I covered it.

1055
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:31,725
I covered it,
it was a double fatal.

1056
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:36,997
Car went underneath a semi, took
the top off, killed the couple.

1057
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:40,801
The state troopers came out
to do the investigation.

1058
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:43,036
And it's winter, there's snow.

1059
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:46,340
One of the troopers
is a pregnant woman.

1060
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:50,711
Which is, which is not,
which is important.

1061
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:53,847
So they're searching around
in the damaged stuff

1062
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:56,583
and the woman finds a sippy cup.

1063
00:51:58,685 --> 00:52:00,420
And then she goes back
to the other guys

1064
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:03,557
and she says,
"Was there another?

1065
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:05,359
"Was there a child in this car?

1066
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,693
Are there any other bodies?"

1067
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,028
They said no.

1068
00:52:08,095 --> 00:52:09,830
She says,
"There's a sippy cup here.

1069
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:11,231
Let's go look."

1070
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:14,134
So they went to the ditches
on the interstate.

1071
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,369
What did they find?

1072
00:52:15,435 --> 00:52:19,373
A little girl just in her socks
in the snow.

1073
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:21,108
Healthy as a fish.

1074
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:25,379
And to me, that's
the miracle story in this book.

1075
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:27,114
And I wrote,

1076
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:29,283
I remember writing
the accident story.

1077
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:34,154
And then I decided to keep the
story as an obit story,

1078
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:39,593
not because of the, I never,
it's because the girl survived.

1079
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,995
Years later, I did track her
down for this book.

1080
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:43,163
Not to write about her,

1081
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,499
but to make sure
everything was okay,

1082
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:47,234
and she's fine
and she's in Minnesota.

1083
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:49,102
To me, it was a miracle story.

1084
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,371
So, okay, my last story.

1085
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,040
And that's because to me,

1086
00:52:53,106 --> 00:52:56,443
this is the epitome
of a death story,

1087
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:05,452
because, I didn't even get to
the mayor of the nude beach,

1088
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,920
Charlie Wise.

1089
00:53:06,987 --> 00:53:09,590
Boy, that guy was interesting.

1090
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:16,330
I write it because
it's this short, okay.

1091
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,166
October 2009.

1092
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,335
I'll just read you
the first graph,

1093
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,803
then I'll tell you the story.

1094
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,873
"Last week, George E. Wood, 81,

1095
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:31,712
got tired, found a place to sit
down out of the rain, and died."

1096
00:53:31,778 --> 00:53:34,014
It's only one page long.

1097
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:39,920
He died in the lobby of Witte
Hall at 615 West Johnson Street.

1098
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:44,458
He had come downtown on the bus,
had no children.

1099
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:48,462
UW, worked for the state of
Wisconsin as an urban planner,

1100
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,198
but he came downtown to shop.

1101
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:00,707
It was raining, so
he sought refuge in the lobby.

1102
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:02,342
He went shopping,
it was raining.

1103
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,378
He sought refuge in the lobby,

1104
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:07,548
sat down on a couch,
and had a heart attack.

1105
00:54:07,614 --> 00:54:09,950
What was he shopping for?

1106
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:13,520
He had been
at the university bookstore

1107
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:16,089
where he bought a calendar.

1108
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:17,824
Now, think about that.

1109
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:21,562
Is that a picture
of hope for the future?

1110
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:26,500
You're 81, you buy a calendar.

1111
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:31,505
The very essence of the future
is to buy a calendar.

1112
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:36,076
It's like saying you can tell
if a society is governable

1113
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:39,079
if people are standing
in line for something

1114
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:41,715
because they have hope,
they have hope.

1115
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:43,217
They're waiting for something.

1116
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,651
They're hoping
something will happen.

1117
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:48,355
Anyway, that was my favorite
little one in that book.

1118
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:51,391
I tell you, I covered everything
in this town for a long time.

1119
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:56,263
Politics, scandals,
consumer swindles, murders,

1120
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,032
births, you name it.

1121
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,369
And this is Halloween week.

1122
00:55:02,436 --> 00:55:04,171
I don't know what
they're doing on State Street.

1123
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:07,241
And I stopped going
to State Street one year

1124
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:10,110
because I was standing there
in my getup,

1125
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:11,478
and this guy walked by.

1126
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:14,381
This kid walked by and he said,
"Hey, Pops."

1127
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:17,851
I looked and it was my son.
[all laughing]

1128
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:23,857
That was it,
no more State Street for me.

1129
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:25,158
All right, I'm done.

1130
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:28,695
[audience laughing
and applauding]
