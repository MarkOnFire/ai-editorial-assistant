1
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,506
- Cat Phan: Whoa, Sergio!

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,007
What's with the piano?

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,809
- Sergio González: Yeah,
I traded in the desk

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:09,977
for this beautiful baby grand.

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,778
What do you think?
- You traded the desk?

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,213
- Oh, I've got a wonderful idea.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,381
You're gonna love this one.

8
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,582
- Questionable,
but let's hear it.

9
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,318
- Okay, do you know that
hit musical <i>Hamilton</i>

10
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,154
about America's Founding Fathers
in the Revolutionary War?

11
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,322
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,425
Imagine <i>Hamilton,</i>
but focused on Wisconsin.

13
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,595
- A musical about Wisconsin
and the American Revolution.

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,498
- Oh, if you thought <i>Hamilton</i>
was a success,

15
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,201
wait until we center
Wisconsin history.

16
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,736
We are gonna go interstellar.

17
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,305
- Okay, let's hear what you got.
- Okay, Cat.

18
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,507
I have been working on this
for about a month.

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,909
I think you're gonna like it.

20
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,111
[opening piano notes]

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,148
[rapping]
? 1776 is the year ?

22
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,785
? And the colonists
have had it up to here ?

23
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,888
? With the British and their
taxes and repressive tactics ?

24
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:59,092
? But in Wisconsin, the fact is,
it's not even a state yet ?

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,061
? Truth is,
I'm starting to regret ?

26
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,565
? This singing exploration
of the founding of our nation ?

27
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,266
Oh, no.

28
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,434
What have I done, Cat?

29
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,902
Turns out Wisconsin
wasn't even a state

30
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,070
during the American Revolution.

31
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,805
What am I supposed
to sing about?

32
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,308
- Yeah, I think we have a little
more learning to do

33
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,643
before you write your next
big hit musical.

34
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,811
Let's call Nick.

35
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,547
I think he was around back then.
- Yeah, probably.

36
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,149
- Nick Hoffman: Hey, Cat,
how's it going?

37
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,317
- Hey, Nick.

38
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,718
Sergio and I need to learn about

39
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,020
any Wisconsin area connections
with the American Revolution.

40
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,857
- Oh, is this about Sergio's
musical again?

41
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,192
- Cat: I see you've been dragged
into this already.

42
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,094
- Yeah, and that's
a tough question.

43
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,797
But why don't we meet up at the
Wisconsin Historical Society?

44
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,499
I think I know someone
who can answer that question.

45
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,667
- Sounds good.

46
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,269
Come on, we're going
to the historical society.

47
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,437
- Okay, let's do it.

48
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,172
[bright music]

49
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,576
- John, can you tell us a
little bit about the factors

50
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,044
that led up
to the American Revolution?

51
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,646
- John W. Hall:
The most famous ones

52
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,082
that your average school student
could cite

53
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,851
are taxation
without representation

54
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,755
and this idea that parliament,
at least,

55
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,625
and later, the king had become
a tyrannical force

56
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,026
in American lives.

57
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,495
There was a lot, lot more
at hand.

58
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,899
And one of the other major
grievances is the sense,

59
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,402
mounting through the 1760s
and into the 1770s,

60
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,672
that the king is going to deny
the colonists

61
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,976
their rightful birthright
to all of North America

62
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,144
to include those lands

63
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,446
that are inhabited
by American Indians.

64
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,916
And so, in the wake
of the Seven Years' War

65
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,951
or French and Indian War
in North America,

66
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,387
Britain tries to establish
a new policy

67
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:37,090
which is gonna keep the settlers
hemmed in, more or less,

68
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,059
to the east side
of the Appalachian Mountains

69
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,328
and preserve Native Americans

70
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,964
in the possession
of their own land.

71
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,933
- The Seven Years' War
was an international conflict

72
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,269
that lasted
from 1754 until 1763.

73
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,672
The two primary forces were
France and Great Britain,

74
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,874
although many other nations
and peoples were involved.

75
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,142
In North America,

76
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,277
the conflict started
with disputes over land claims

77
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,413
in the area
of the Ohio River Valley.

78
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,649
When the conflict ended in 1763
with the Treaty of Paris,

79
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,319
France was forced to cede
its lands in Canada,

80
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,421
then New France, to the British.

81
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,623
Now, although Great Britain
expanded its holdings

82
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,891
in North America,

83
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,360
a number of factors
related to the Seven Years' War

84
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,996
would ultimately lead
to the American Revolution.

85
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,098
This included American
colonists' desire

86
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,502
to take lands that were supposed
to be held by Indian nations,

87
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,971
and the new taxes that were
imposed on colonists

88
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,107
as a way to pay off Britain's
national debt.

89
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,509
You're kind of laying out,
I think,

90
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,943
one of the misconceptions
people have,

91
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,245
which is the
American Revolution

92
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,580
is between American colonists
and the British crown,

93
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,316
but there are a lot more players
kind of in the mix here.

94
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,352
- Essentially,
every Native nation

95
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,053
east of the Mississippi River

96
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,958
was involved in this conflict
in one degree or another.

97
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,593
- Bringing it back
to where we are

98
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,297
in the western Great Lakes,
what's the status on the ground

99
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,133
right as the American Revolution
is about to begin?

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,870
- Because France was wholly
defeated in North America

101
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,540
in that French and Indian
or Seven Years' War,

102
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,343
the agents of the French crown,
the soldiers, they're all gone.

103
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,678
And what that does

104
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,415
is it leaves the Indigenous
inhabitants of this region

105
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:12,819
in need of a new, beneficent
European partner.

106
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,857
And it is now Britain
that steps in and says,

107
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,593
"We now are in that position

108
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,962
to be your friends and allies
and partners."

109
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,832
So here, in what we presently
call Wisconsin,

110
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,336
the vast majority of the tribes
are aligned in sentiment

111
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,605
and interest with Britain

112
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,575
because Britain
is in the position

113
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,144
to fill those trading posts
and the positions.

114
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,946
- So maybe we can talk
a little bit

115
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,747
about the archival sources
we have here

116
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,183
that can give us some insights
into how they interacted.

117
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,953
- We have a document here
from 1778,

118
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,656
during the American Revolution,
in which Frederick Haldimand,

119
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,192
the governor general
of British Canada,

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,829
is giving this Menominee chief
not merely a certificate,

121
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,333
but a certificate
that accompanies a medal.

122
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,801
- Starting in the 1600s

123
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,936
and continuing
through the 1800s,

124
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,272
presentation medals were given
to American Indians

125
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,842
by Spanish, French, British, and
American government officials,

126
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,911
missionaries, and traders.

127
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,881
Europeans gave medals as a way
of securing an alliance,

128
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,549
to commemorate a treaty signing,

129
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,451
to honor Native visitors
to a city,

130
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,286
or as a reward for service.

131
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,088
Many of these medals
were highly regarded

132
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,856
by their Native recipients.

133
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,858
Some Native individuals
chose to be buried

134
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,026
with their medals,

135
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,761
some handed them down
to descendants,

136
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,998
and some chose to wear them
in portrait images.

137
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,165
- Sir Frederick Haldimand,

138
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,368
a British Army officer
and colonial official,

139
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,939
gave this medal to a Menominee
chief on August 17, 1778.

140
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,241
The chief's name was Chawanon.

141
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,311
Haldimand presented the medal
at a general council in Montreal

142
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,114
with representatives of the
Sioux, Sauk, Fox,

143
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,617
Menominee, Winnebago, Ottawa,
Potawatomi, and Chippewa.

144
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,619
The medal is made
of two silver discs

145
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,888
that have been bound
with a silver rim.

146
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,824
One side features
a portrait of King George III.

147
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,560
The text on this side reads

148
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,729
"George III by the Grace
of God" in Latin,

149
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,631
which is part
of his royal title.

150
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,767
The reverse side features
the royal crest

151
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,168
with a text of the royal motto,

152
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,471
again in Latin,
"God and My Right."

153
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,408
- Cat: To learn more about Chief
Chawanon and the medal,

154
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,609
Sergio and I spoke with the

155
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,145
Menominee Tribal Historic
Preservation Officer,

156
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,479
David Grignon.

157
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,049
- David Grignon:
Chief Chawanon is,

158
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,651
actually, his name is
Tsheka Tshake Mau.

159
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,221
He was also known
as the Old King.

160
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,590
And he was from the Bear Clan.

161
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:33,560
He was the one that
greeted the British coming in

162
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,763
to the Bay area
to do the fur trade.

163
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,235
Chawanon and others
in the Bay area,

164
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:45,706
they always told the British
or the French that

165
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,940
"If you build this fort,

166
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,943
it's still gonna be
on Menominee land."

167
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,779
And he stressed that to them.

168
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,349
- Now, this style of medal first
appears in the Americas

169
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,584
in the summer of 1776.

170
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,419
These medals were likely
intended as a way

171
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,488
of gaining the favor
of Native nations

172
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,190
and keeping them as allies
in the war

173
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,858
against American colonists.

174
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,660
John, it sounds like from
everything you're telling us,

175
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,061
we often have this idea

176
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,731
that the American Revolution
is about freedom and liberty,

177
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,534
and it certainly is about that,
but a lot more complicated.

178
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,369
It's about land,
it's about territory,

179
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,571
it's about who gets to decide
how rules are being made.

180
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,274
- I mean, these are the two
sides of the same coin, right?

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,876
And I would argue that much
of ensuing American history

182
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,811
is kind of a struggle
of the United States

183
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,414
to live up to ideals
that are embodied

184
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,183
in the Declaration
of Independence.

185
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,853
But the flip side of it
is that they do feel that

186
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,256
the British crown
is impinging upon their rights

187
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,692
to treat continental
North America

188
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,794
as something of a birthright.

189
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,996
- Whoa, Cat,
what a conversation!

190
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,965
- The American Revolution
involves so much more

191
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,634
than just colonists, the
British, and the East Coast.

192
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,370
- Yeah, it was definitely
a multinational conflict.

193
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,707
- So, are you ready to write
your next big hit musical?

194
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,109
- Broadway, here we come!

195
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,848
? Taxation without
representation? ?

196
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,716
? That's not the full story ?

197
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,752
? Truth is,
the young nation wanted ?

198
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,988
? More and more territory ?

199
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,857
? - But Native peoples
in the region ?

200
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,491
? Had their own incentive ?

201
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,193
? Their strategies were legion ?

202
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,128
? Their approaches
were inventive ?

203
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,830
? More than just to survive ?

204
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,732
? But for people to thrive ?

205
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,069
? - All this to regale
the American Revolution ?

206
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,670
? Is more than just the tale ?

207
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:27,040
? Of British
and colonial resolution ?

208
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,042
? It's multinational history ?

209
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,380
? And Wisconsin's role
is no longer a mystery ?

210
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,982
? - But now it's your turn ?

211
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,050
? What would you
like to learn? ?

212
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,320
? Ask a friend or a teacher
to come along ?

213
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,958
? And get together
to write your own history song ?

214
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,562

- Producer: You got it!
- Yeah?

216
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,334
All right.

217
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,336
That does it for Wisconsin
in the American Revolution.

218
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,306
Next, Wisconsin goes to space!
