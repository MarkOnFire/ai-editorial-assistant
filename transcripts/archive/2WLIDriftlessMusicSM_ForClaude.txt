2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,071
- Angela Fitzgerald:
For most any traveler,

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,540
reaching
the Driftless Music Gardens

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,675
will come at the end
of a long trip.

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,277
- Crickett Lochner: C'mon down!

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,079
You made it!
- Man: I made it!

7
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,514
Where are you
driving in from?

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,815
You are literally
being taken

9
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,417
to the middle of nowhere,
and then beyond.

10
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,052
[chuckles]

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,555
- He drove,
like, eight hours.

12
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,891
- After that long journey,
chances are

13
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,326
Crickett Lochner will be there
with a warm welcome.

14
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,562
- Crickett Lochner: Hello!

15
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,097
We love
sharing this space

16
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,566
with people
that appreciate it.

17
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,301
You made it!
Yeah!

18
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,537
- Thousands make it
each year

19
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,206
to set up tents
and camp out,

20
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,374
stroll the grounds,

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,042
and listen
to live music

22
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,477
at one
of the summer festivals

23
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,279
held at the gardens.

24
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,613
? ?

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,150
- Crickett: Peace, love,
music, community.

26
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,719
Why not enjoy music
in the middle of nowhere

27
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,321
and good weather?

28
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,291
- Crickett's greetings are meant
to make guests feel at home.

29
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,592
- JLA, hurry up, hurry up!

30
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,229
- Man: Sorry!
- What's up, buddy?
Whoo!

31
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,333
- Because it's Crickett's home
that she's welcoming people to.

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,337
The music gardens occupy
the farm where she grew up,

33
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,707
land that's been in her family
since the 1850s.

34
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:17,744
She lives in her childhood home
where her father also grew up.

35
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,880
"This will take it
on to the sixth generation now,

36
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,548
with Crickett."

37
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,750
Crickett's not alone
on the farm.

38
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,221
Husband Tim might like it there
even more than his wife.

39
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,958
- Tim Lochner:
I couldn't be prouder to have
married into this family.

40
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,292
I tell people
all the time

41
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,162
that I married
into the hippie dream out here.

42
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,031
I'm growing vegetables,
I'm throwing music,

43
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,533
I'm hanging out
with my father-in-law

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,934
who looks
just like Willie Nelson.

45
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,536
[Crickett's dad chuckles]
- Just got out of the field.

46
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,372
Crickett: My husband,
he's in a band.

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,074
[singing]

48
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,909
- Tim's group,
the People Brothers Band,

49
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,045
had played
and put on music festivals.

50
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,681
That experience
opened the couple's eyes

51
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,050
to the family farm's
potential.

52
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,753
- Tim: When we moved out here,
we kind of started dreaming

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,421
of having music
over in this nook

54
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,756
or music
over in that nook,

55
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,025
hence
the Driftless Music Gardens.

56
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,761
- Driftless for
the region's topography.

57
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,363
- Crickett: The glaciers
never came through

58
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,999
to readjust
the landscape.

59
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,836
- And Driftless for the vibe
the land inspires.

60
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,105
- Crickett: And that's
the same with here.

61
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,273
It just flows.

62
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,541
The Driftless.

63
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,942
It just...
you flow.

64
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,144
[cheers and applause]

65
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,213
- Angela: The number
of music lovers

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,714
flowing to
the gardens

67
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,751
has grown steadily
since 2016.

68
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,054
But this season marks
a new stage for the venture.

69
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:38,258
Literally, a new stage
to keep the shows going on.

70
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,194
- Crickett: Every ounce of
energy
that we had

71
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,762
went into
building that stage.

72
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,030
Love, sweat, and tears.

73
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,698
- Angela:
But they didn't do it alone.

74
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,901
The community they'd built,
built it with them.

75
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,603
- Tim: Once we got
the project rolling,

76
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,972
we had to start
making a lot of phone calls

77
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,574
and calling in
a lot of favors

78
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,741
and have friends over.

79
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,678
It's kind of like
an old-fashioned barn raising.

80
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,513
- Crickett: I think
at one time

81
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,981
we had 50 people
out here

82
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,016
just, like, hammering away.

83
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,521
- Angela: Even the farmland
offered up its own contribution.

84
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,523
The inside of the stage
that you see

85
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,959
is the pine
from the land.

86
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,696
And so, it is
a huge proud moment and love

87
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,265
that we share
with the land.

88
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,201
All my team members
that shared a hand

89
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,469
in building the stage,

90
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,172
the first show
that we all saw,

91
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,041
it just brought
tears of joy.

92
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,143
- Angela: It's a new landmark
on a landscape

93
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,311
that's been home

94
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,780
to six generations
of Crickett's family.

95
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,183
But for
all that's changed,

96
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,718
the life
they live today

97
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,152
may not be
so different.

98
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
- Tim: We're out here
farming music now

99
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,024
instead of growing corn
or raising cows.

100
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,393
There's some striking
similarities

101
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,528
to what we do:

102
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,596
is everything's dependent
on the weather,

103
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,765
and if
it's a great weekend,

104
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,667
we could have
a good crop.

105
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,802
If it's going to rain
all weekend, we're in trouble.

106
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,539
So, no different
than a lot of my neighbors.

107
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,509
- But... what they grow here now
feeds the soul.

108
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,479
<i>- Crickett: "Why did I</i>
<i>come back here?"</i>

109
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,080
Because it's where
my bliss is,

110
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,115
where I feel whole.

111
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,985
It calms me, balances me,
gets me rooted.

112
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,155
To be able to offer that
to so many others

113
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,857
is a huge gift.

114
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,592
