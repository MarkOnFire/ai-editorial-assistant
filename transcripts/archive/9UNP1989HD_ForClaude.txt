2
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,545
- Rachel Belida: Hello,
everyone.

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,447
Thank you so much
for being here today.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,115
It's great to spend a weekend

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,684
with all you
wonderful gardeners.

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,353
My name is Rachel Belida,

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:25,392
and I will be talking about the
art of food forest design today.

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,862
Here's a quick overview
of what I'll talk about.

9
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,798
I'll give you
a brief introduction to myself.

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,902
We'll talk about what
a food forest design is,

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,304
the seven layers
of a food forest.

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,439
We'll talk about a few
of the benefits,

13
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,009
and then I will show you
some sample designs

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,911
that I put together.

15
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,313
We'll talk about some
food forest plants

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,316
and some common questions
about food forests.

17
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,387
And at the end,
we'll have some time for Q&A.

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,658
So I want to start with just a
very brief background of myself,

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,662
because I think it helps
to understand, like, my take

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,332
on food forests and how
I approach them the way I do.

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,735
So, I first became interested
in plants in high school,

22
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,737
and I decided
to study horticulture

23
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,840
and landscape design.

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,209
So I did that
at the University of Minnesota.

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,312
Afterwards, I bravely set off
and started

26
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,948
a gardening business
where I did garden design,

27
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,417
installation, and maintenance
in Minneapolis.

28
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,186
But it was then that
I kind of felt like something,

29
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,222
there could be more to this.

30
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,024
Maybe we can grow food
in a really beautiful way.

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,594
So I had that in the back
of my mind,

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,596
but I also really
wanted to join the Peace Corps.

33
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,166
So I took a couple years
and I went to Mali, West Africa,

34
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,367
and there's a picture of me

35
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,838
with my best friend, Manya,
in the village.

36
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,773
When I got back,
I was still thinking about

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,109
growing food and wondering
how we could incorporate

38
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,211
more food into landscapes.

39
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,181
And at some point,
I learned about permaculture.

40
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,750
So if you don't know
about permaculture,

41
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,786
a very brief definition
would be,

42
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,489
it's a system of design
that connects the pieces

43
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,791
that works on making
connections between things

44
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,095
rather than just having a lot
of separate parts.

45
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,230
So I studied
permaculture design,

46
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,833
and I also studied
some herbal medicine,

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,170
and that brings me to where
I am today with my business,

48
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,240
Daily Harvest Designs,
where I focus on a combination

49
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,810
of ornamental landscape
design style plus permaculture.

50
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,412
So it's kind of
bringing it all together

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,081
in a really beautiful way
that can be incorporated

52
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,852
into residential landscapes
beautifully.

53
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,323
So, what is a food forest?

54
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,359
Is anyone here brand-new
to food forests?

55
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,228
Yeah, a few hands,
all right.

56
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,464
So I'm gonna start
with a very simple definition.

57
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,168
A food forest mimics how
nature works in an actual forest

58
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,803
while growing food.

59
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,538
And that's a
pretty basic definition,

60
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,108
but if you can just imagine
standing on a trail in a forest,

61
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,677
thinking of all the plants,

62
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,346
but having those all
be food-producing plants,

63
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,449
that's generally what
a food forest is.

64
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,254
If you're looking for
a more comprehensive definition,

65
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,289
a food forest is
a layered garden

66
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,792
that creates
a self-sustaining ecosystem.

67
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,695
It has seven layers,
from roots to tall trees,

68
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,130
allowing various plants
to grow together.

69
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,301
This design boosts biodiversity
and strengthens the ecosystem.

70
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,870
By including edible plants,

71
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,372
a food forest supports
sustainable food production

72
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,374
and creates
a healthy environment

73
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,443
for many plants and animals.

74
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,479
So, as you can see, it's more
than just about growing food.

75
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,183
It's about creating a
whole system that works together

76
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,919
and kind of supports itself.

77
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,625
So you might be wondering,
what does this all mean for you?

78
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,594
And if you think about a forest,

79
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,264
it will grow
whether or not humans are there

80
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,431
taking care of it, right?

81
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,668
It doesn't need
a lot of attention.

82
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,537
So that's the idea
with a food forest.

83
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,872
Like, how can we grow food
in a way

84
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,575
that is just gonna keep
coming back year after year

85
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:06,046
without having to put all this
time and energy into the garden?

86
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,116
So, for us gardeners,
I don't know about any of you,

87
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,552
but sometimes I like
to be a lazy gardener.

88
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,554
I have other things going on
in my life,

89
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,156
and I just want to be able
to harvest some food.

90
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:20,127
So a food forest is a way
to have a landscape

91
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:26,600
that's partly self-sustaining
while you're still growing food.

92
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,801
All right,
so we'll talk about

93
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,203
the seven layers
of the food forest,

94
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,205
and I won't spend
a ton of time on this.

95
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,275
I just wanna mention
a few of the harvests

96
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,344
that you might expect
from each layer,

97
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:42,316
and a couple of the functions of
each layer of the food forest.

98
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,051
The top layer is the canopy,

99
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,487
and these are the trees that are
about 30 feet tall or more.

100
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,756
Harvests that you
might expect from these trees

101
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:54,494
would be sap, some nuts,
some fruit, and medicine.

102
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,068
And of course, trees are great
for producing shade and oxygen.

103
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,704
They help with our air quality
and climate improvement.

104
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,406
So you might be wondering
how in the world

105
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,610
you might fit a canopy tree
into your garden.

106
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,778
Perhaps you have
an urban landscape

107
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,680
or you already have a lot
of plants growing.

108
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:14,848
And the great news is,

109
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,017
is that you don't have to have
the canopy tree.

110
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:22,890
It's okay to skip this layer if
it doesn't work with your space.

111
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,492
The next layer is
the understory layer,

112
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:31,131
and these are the trees that are
about 10 to 30 feet in height.

113
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:35,869
Foods that you can grow here
are a lot of fruit trees.

114
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,671
So this would be
like your fruit tree layer,

115
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,873
whether you have
dwarf fruit trees,

116
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,178
semi-dwarf,
or standard-sized fruit trees.

117
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,581
Fruit trees this size
are excellent for climbing.

118
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,917
I know my kids love
to be up in the trees.

119
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,285
They like to play make-believe

120
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,688
and just spend
a lot of time up there.

121
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,590
So they're great for recreation.

122
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,926
And then, these trees
also start to bring in

123
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:03,230
more species diversity
into the food forest.

124
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,766
Next is a shrub layer.

125
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,935
These are plants that are woody

126
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,004
and up to about 10 feet
in height.

127
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:17,411
This is a layer where you're
gonna find a lot of fruit

128
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,348
and some nuts, and some
medicinal plants as well.

129
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:24,117
Similarly
to the understory layer,

130
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,787
there's a lot
of species diversity.

131
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,555
There's nutrient cycling
that happens.

132
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,123
So it's creating this system

133
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,159
where all the leaves
are just falling to the ground,

134
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,161
and that's gonna be
the mulch for your space.

135
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:39,433
And, over time, it's gonna help
with the soil building

136
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,302
and other benefits like that.

137
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,243
This layer is
the herbaceous layer.

138
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,912
This is probably my favorite
because this is where

139
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,748
we start to get
a lot of color,

140
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,752
lots of flowers, lots of
different scents in the garden.

141
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,457
And those are helpful
because they can repel,

142
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,592
confuse, and distract pests,

143
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,296
and they can also help
to attract beneficial insects,

144
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:13,000
as well, for pollination
in your food forest.

145
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,668
So this is a layer

146
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:19,206
that can help a lot with
ecosystem health and fertility.

147
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:24,611
Harvests are more varied
in this layer: edible flowers,

148
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:29,983
tea, culinary herbs, greens,
lots of different medicines.

149
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,885
And it's also kind of
the fun layer.

150
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,421
I love to go out
and just pick flowers

151
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:39,726
and have lovely flowers
on my table throughout the year.

152
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,934
The next layer is the
ground cover layer,

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,169
and I like to think about
this layer

154
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,205
as being like natural mulch.

155
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,042
So it's your living mulch layer
that covers the soil,

156
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,744
and if the soil's covered,

157
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,047
you're gonna have
less erosion.

158
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,982
You'll have less weeds coming in

159
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,751
because you don't have
that open soil space.

160
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,154
And there are quite a few foods

161
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,156
that you could harvest
from this layer,

162
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:14,361
like fruit, edible flowers,
greens, herbs, and medicines.

163
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,067
Next, we have the root layer.

164
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,771
This would be your root veggies
and your medicine.

165
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,508
The roots are fantastic
for helping to build soil.

166
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,544
So if you have a garden
with a lot of clay soil,

167
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,047
you can grow plants
like daikon radishes,

168
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,416
where they have
very large roots,

169
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,585
and they'll break up
that clay soil.

170
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,187
And if you leave them
in the ground,

171
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,788
they're gonna break down,
and over time,

172
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,559
it's gonna start
to build up a really nice soil,

173
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,629
soil health and soil community.

174
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,497
Roots are also fantastic

175
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,332
for uplifting water
and nutrients.

176
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,435
So bringing that up from deep
in the soil up to the top,

177
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,305
and then if you can chop
the tops of the plants back

178
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,506
and lay that on the soil,

179
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,742
it's adding, like,
this nice mulch to the top

180
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,612
and working
with that nutrient cycling.

181
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,349
The next layer is
the vine layer.

182
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,185
So these are your climbers.

183
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,389
And in a food forest,
you can design it in a way

184
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,825
that you're really making use
of all of the space

185
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,460
in your landscape.

186
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,664
So paths can be a space
to grow food.

187
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,066
So as you can see
in the picture,

188
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,970
I have arbors
over the pathway in my garden.

189
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,805
And it's a great way
to grow squash.

190
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:35,442
So you're increasing the amount
of photosynthesis in the space

191
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,645
and increasing your production.

192
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,583
The food you can get
are vegetables,

193
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,651
lots of staple crops
like dry beans,

194
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,287
that's a great thing to grow,
squash, fruit,

195
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,257
edible flowers,
and medicinal plants.

196
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,527
I love to grow vines
for the craft material.

197
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,862
Grapevines are great.

198
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,231
I've got all sorts
of weavings and things

199
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,632
going on in my garden.

200
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:03,804
It's just fun to play with those
and integrate them as well.

201
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,006
There is one more layer
that I don't have up here.

202
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,207
It's kind of the bonus layer.

203
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,709
So if you like to eat mushrooms,

204
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,712
you can incorporate mushrooms
or a fungi layer

205
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,581
into your food forest as well.

206
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,519
So, next, I just wanna mention

207
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,554
a few of the food forest
benefits

208
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,023
before we get on
to some design ideas.

209
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,627
And hopefully, you picked up
on some of them already

210
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,030
as we talked about
the seven layers.

211
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,233
So the first benefit is
biodiversity.

212
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,235
So if you're picturing a forest,
there are so many

213
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,038
different types of plants
that grow in the forest.

214
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:41,241
And then, within each
of those groups of plants,

215
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,845
there's a wide variety of plants
that will grow in each layer,

216
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,013
if that makes sense.

217
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,316
So you have this
large diversity of plants,

218
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,853
and with that,
it's going to invite in

219
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,891
a nice variety of insects
and birds and animals,

220
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,594
and it starts
to create a community of life

221
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,665
that supports itself,
to a certain extent.

222
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,401
So with that,
you end up with a healthy,

223
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,370
healthier ecosystem
that needs less interventions,

224
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:14,474
and that goes back to the lazy
gardening that I like to do.

225
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,476
The next benefit is soil health.

226
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,879
So food forests are typically--

227
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,349
well, primarily made up
of perennial foods,

228
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,117
and that means
that you plant them once,

229
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,453
you don't have to disturb
your soil again.

230
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,158
So the soil really has a chance
to have a life of its own.

231
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,760
It's not being disturbed
all the time,

232
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:39,666
you know, year after year, every
spring to plant seeds again.

233
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:44,338
And next is maintenance
with the diverse planting.

234
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:48,742
You really end up with a more
self-sustaining garden

235
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,278
than you would otherwise.

236
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,315
Food security is
another benefit,

237
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,050
and that one seems
quite obvious,

238
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,052
since we're talking
about food forests.

239
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,755
But the one thing I want to
mention is the perennial foods.

240
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:05,826
I love that even if I don't
plant any annual vegetables

241
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,794
in the springtime,
I'm still gonna have

242
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,998
quite a big harvest of food
from our garden,

243
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,468
because those plants
are gonna grow and harvest,

244
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:15,969
or grow and produce,

245
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,474
whether or not, you know, you're
doing much of anything for them

246
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,142
once they're established.

247
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,446
So I think that's a really
huge benefit to food forests.

248
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,950
And then, there's also quite
a big diversity of harvests

249
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:34,388
and harvests that you
can get throughout the season.

250
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,056
And you can grow plants

251
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,425
that you would not normally find
in the grocery stores

252
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,761
or at farmers' markets.

253
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,563
And then, of course,
if you have excess food,

254
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,699
you can share it with your
neighbors and your community.

255
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,634
And lastly, aesthetics.

256
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:48,936
So, this is kind of

257
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,672
where my ornamental landscape
design training comes in.

258
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,274
But I think that
food forests are so beautiful.

259
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,343
I mean,
they can be designed in a way

260
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,879
that's going to look gorgeous
with your home.

261
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,547
It can draw people in.

262
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:06,153
You can use certain plants
as focal points in your garden,

263
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,624
and they really create wonderful
visual interest year 'round

264
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:11,892
because you have the structure,

265
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,530
you have the trees
and the shrubs in your gardens.

266
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,669
Next, I'd like
to show you a few sample designs

267
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:27,207
that I put together,
and it's just some examples

268
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,878
of how you could take these
seven layers of a food forest

269
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,380
and incorporate them
into perhaps your own

270
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,717
residential space
or a public garden.

271
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,756
The first one I want to talk
about is a food forest border,

272
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,225
or what I'm calling
a food forest border, at least.

273
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,994
And this would be a planting

274
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,297
that separates a space
in some way.

275
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:55,068
So it could be used to block
or highlight a view.

276
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,337
You could use it to add privacy

277
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,641
or direct traffic
through a space.

278
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,810
You could put it
along a property line,

279
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,213
whether it's a front,
side, or back yard,

280
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,516
or between some outdoor spaces
to create, like, outdoor rooms

281
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,820
or the feeling of a space
being closed in a bit.

282
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:19,293
So, I chose this property just
randomly off of Google Maps,

283
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,628
and I chose this one because
it felt like, you know,

284
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,863
a kind of standard,

285
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,433
newer development
neighborhood residential home.

286
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,669
Got the driveway in the front,

287
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,637
single-family home,
a deck in the back,

288
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,673
and I love that they have
a little vegetable garden

289
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,209
way off in the back corner.

290
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,181
So for this design example,
or, for this property,

291
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,851
I came up with three
different examples

292
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,354
of how you could incorporate
a food forest into this space.

293
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:48,822
So, I created a base map,

294
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,558
which is basically
the outline of the property,

295
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,627
the home and driveway
and whatnot.

296
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:57,364
And I added that green circle,
which could be an open space.

297
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,366
It could be a lawn
or an eco lawn,

298
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,369
just some sort of extended
gathering space off the deck.

299
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:05,038
And from there,
I put in a canopy tree.

300
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:09,543
So that could be, like,
a standard-sized fruit tree

301
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,145
or a nut tree,
and then a few understory trees,

302
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,315
which could be fruit trees
in the corner.

303
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,353
And then, after that,
you could put in some

304
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,823
groups of shrubs
kind of clustered together

305
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,460
and plant herbs
and roots underneath.

306
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,864
The little vegetable garden
in the back

307
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,567
could actually be moved up
closer to the deck,

308
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:38,372
because the vegetables need much
more maintenance and watering

309
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,674
and care than your food forest
is going to need.

310
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,276
So that could be closer
to the deck

311
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,546
just to save yourself
some time and energy

312
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,981
and to have that close by
so you can easily run out

313
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:51,852
and harvest veggies and herbs
for cooking.

314
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,922
Something like this would blend
really well in a neighborhood

315
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,858
because it's very organized.

316
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,459
It has a really neat appearance,

317
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,428
but you can still get
those benefits of,

318
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:05,199
like, the food forest structure
from it.

319
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,902
This is a very similar example
to the last one.

320
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,637
The only difference is
that the plants are

321
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,173
in a more kind of
natural pattern.

322
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,344
They're not grouped together
like the other one was.

323
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,546
And if you wanted to add
vines in for this layer,

324
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,782
you could add a pergola
over the deck,

325
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,285
or you could add arbors
along the left side of the house

326
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:30,691
to make a nice pathway from the
front yard to the back yard.

327
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,827
And the last example
for this property

328
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:36,063
is just simply a line of plants.

329
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,231
So something like this

330
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,267
could be great for creating a
living fence.

331
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,003
It could be used along a road,

332
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,140
anywhere you would like
to block the view.

333
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,375
For this one,

334
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,177
I put the canopy tree
in the front yard

335
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:53,614
to add some height and shade for
the house during the summertime,

336
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,884
and then the sunlight can
come in during the wintertime.

337
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,585
And for the shrubs and trees,

338
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,454
I would keep them between,
you know,

339
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,223
maybe waist height
and up to about 10 feet tall,

340
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,559
because that will create
a nice visual barrier

341
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,294
whether you're inside the house,

342
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,864
like on the first floor,
or out on the back deck.

343
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:15,402
Can really create
some privacy between spaces.

344
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,405
The next example is
what I'm calling

345
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,240
a freestanding food forest.

346
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,242
So this is an example
of a garden

347
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,379
that could be placed
in pretty much any open,

348
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,481
sunny, grassy space.

349
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:32,719
It could be used in a public
space or a residential property,

350
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,922
perhaps at a
commercial building,

351
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,291
or, like, a business park
where employees could go out

352
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:41,828
and take their break
or eat their lunch outside.

353
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:48,569
So, I started with three circles
that are exactly the same size,

354
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,604
organized
in a triangular pattern,

355
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,606
and I left plenty of space
in between.

356
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:55,909
So the gray area is
a nice, wide path

357
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,713
where there's some open space
in the center,

358
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,082
and that could be for benches
or a picnic table,

359
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,618
perhaps an outdoor classroom
at a school.

360
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,286
And the brown lines around

361
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:09,857
are just, like, mulched
access paths into the center

362
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,259
of the circular gardens.

363
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,029
There's a canopy tree
in the northernmost garden

364
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,199
and about five understory trees,

365
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:24,404
so those would be nice fruit
trees in the other gardens.

366
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,641
And then from there,
I added in some more layers.

367
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,277
So now we've got
the shrub layer mixed in.

368
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,714
And these I kept mostly
in groups and clusters.

369
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,484
So it still has a really nice
organized appearance,

370
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,353
especially
if it's a public garden

371
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,021
and you want to keep it
looking intentional

372
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:43,423
and kind of neat and tidy.

373
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,995
And after that,

374
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,832
the herbs and ground covers and
roots can be planted underneath,

375
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,902
and those are
the green hatched areas.

376
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,138
And for this one, I also
added in pollinator plants.

377
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,874
So, oftentimes,
when I'm designing gardens,

378
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:04,344
there are places where it's hard
to find the right plant

379
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:09,683
or perhaps you don't want to
grow food in a certain area, so.

380
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,818
And it's also great
to add in the native plants

381
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,887
because those
are going to bring in

382
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,557
the beneficial insects
and pollinators

383
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,761
and all of your native insects
to the garden.

384
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,764
So I added in some
shade-loving native plants

385
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,634
and some sun-loving
pollinator plants.

386
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:32,606
So, this last one is
a food forest landscape.

387
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:37,444
So this is an example
of a residential property.

388
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,514
And a garden like this
could be--

389
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,116
It's a combination
of the ornamental

390
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,685
landscape design principles

391
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,954
plus permaculture
and food forests

392
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,525
kind of all mixed together
into one landscape.

393
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:55,329
So you could take any
of these ideas for your home

394
00:19:55,395 --> 00:20:01,201
or around commercial buildings
or around public properties.

395
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,940
And once again, I chose a
property just kind of randomly.

396
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,175
It's an urban lot.

397
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,844
It's a duplex, so you see there
are two sidewalks

398
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,348
going up to the property
on the left side.

399
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,918
There are two street trees
between the street

400
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,253
and the sidewalk.

401
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,989
And aside from that,
not too many other plants.

402
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,424
There is a driveway
and a garage in the back

403
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:28,462
and a walkway up
to the back part of the house.

404
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,065
So I created the base map
for this one,

405
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,001
and then I started adding
in some trees

406
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,502
for the food forest.

407
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,672
In the northern part of the
backyard, there's a canopy tree.

408
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,474
The north side, obviously,
is a great place

409
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,544
to put your taller plants
and to create some nice,

410
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,512
shady gathering spaces as well,

411
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,481
because it's great
to be able to go out

412
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:48,949
and interact
with your food forest

413
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,817
and spend some time there.

414
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:55,055
I added a couple smaller
canopy trees along the sidewalk,

415
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:58,392
because that is probably
a really hot and sunny place,

416
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:03,263
so a little shade would be nice
for people using the sidewalk.

417
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,866
And then, a few other
understory trees,

418
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,434
which could be the fruit trees,

419
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,771
and those would be, like, dwarf
or semi-dwarf fruit trees.

420
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:13,173
There are also a few
larger shrubs,

421
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,579
and those are placed so that
they can create some privacy,

422
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,050
so both between the front doors
of the homes

423
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,918
and by the backyard.

424
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:27,588
You can see that I'm starting
to kind of enclose the backyard

425
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,790
with this food forest.

426
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:35,662
Next, I added a gathering space
in the backyard.

427
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:39,032
Some vegetable gardens along
the sidewalk on the south side,

428
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,102
and those would
be raised gardens

429
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,204
since they're right
along the sidewalk

430
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,939
and it's nice to keep
your veggies up,

431
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:50,344
kind of out of the dog zone
and off the sidewalk.

432
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:54,248
And you could add some height
with trellises or arbors

433
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,983
between the veggie beds,

434
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,918
and then, also,
a nice walk-through arbor

435
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,220
to access the back area.

436
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,491
There are also
some foundation plantings,

437
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:06,860
so those could be
some berry bushes right around

438
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,563
the front corner
of the house.

439
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:14,101
And on the north side,
some larger shrubs,

440
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,335
larger shade-loving shrubs.

441
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,004
I would imagine
some elderberries

442
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,639
would grow well there.

443
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,374
They could grow
under that canopy tree

444
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,542
and behind the garage,

445
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:26,280
and create a really nice,
private backyard space.

446
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,049
And then, after that,

447
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:34,054
you can add in your herbs
and roots and ground covers.

448
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,523
That brings in so much more food
and medicine

449
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,060
to this space,
and flowers and color.

450
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,830
Sometimes, there are
just places in a landscape

451
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,632
where you would prefer
not to grow food,

452
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,936
and on a corner residential lot,

453
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,405
you might want to avoid
growing food directly

454
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,573
in the planting strips,

455
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,741
just depending on
how busy your street is.

456
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,643
It's really case by case.

457
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,980
But those are
fantastic opportunities

458
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,548
to grow native plants.

459
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:05,219
So I put pollinator plants
all around the corner

460
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:07,487
in that sunny southwest corner,

461
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,490
and some more shade-loving
native plants

462
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,226
in the other areas.

463
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:19,600
So, next, I'd like to talk about
some food forest plants.

464
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:25,439
So, hopefully,
with those design examples

465
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,374
and that quick overview
of food forests,

466
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,344
you can start to picture
what a food forest

467
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,480
could look like in your space.

468
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:36,984
But once you get
the design kind of set,

469
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,452
what are you gonna plant there?

470
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,087
So that's the fun part,

471
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:41,822
and it's always kind of
the last part

472
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,857
that I do with designs.

473
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,494
For canopy trees,
I would love to talk about

474
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,830
every single plant, but I'm
gonna just pick and choose

475
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:52,833
a few to talk about
for each of these areas.

476
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,670
And there might be some groans,
but black walnut trees.

477
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,872
Does anyone have
black walnut trees here?

478
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,607
Yes.

479
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,577
Do any of you know that you
can tap your black walnut trees

480
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:06,613
and make the most delicious
syrup I've ever tasted?

481
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,583
I see some nods back there,
yes.

482
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,452
So that's always a first harvest
for us in our yard.

483
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,122
We have about
a dozen black walnut trees,

484
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:19,760
and the sap makes, I mean,
the syrup is fantastic.

485
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,729
So, sometimes, you know,

486
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,099
you might already have
these plants growing

487
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,168
in your garden or in your yard,

488
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,805
and it's just a matter
of knowing what to do with them,

489
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:34,775
you know, and learning
a little bit more about that.

490
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:38,745
So that's my example
for the canopy trees.

491
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,814
And you can see we've got our

492
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,284
little tea cup
collecting sap there.

493
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:46,687
And then of, course,
canopy trees are fantastic

494
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:50,624
for relaxing,
putting up your hammock.

495
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,196
The next layer,
the understory trees.

496
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,665
For this layer, there are
so many different fruits

497
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:01,335
that we can grow in Wisconsin.

498
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:04,505
Peaches, a lot of people
are surprised by that,

499
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,074
but peach trees will grow here,

500
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,410
and we have one that has
just produced so many peaches,

501
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:15,482
and they are juicy and delicious
and healthy, chemical-free.

502
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,784
You can grow cherries,

503
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:22,189
sour cherries, crab apples,
elderberries.

504
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,924
There's a hardy fig tree

505
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:28,228
which I'm still trying
to get to produce figs.

506
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:33,700
And these are all
great understory trees.

507
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:36,203
And they'll make,

508
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,741
they'll add to the structure
of your landscape.

509
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,743
Some shrub ideas.

510
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:44,645
We've got currants.

511
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,914
Currants are super easy to grow.

512
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,251
They look nice in a food forest
or an edible landscape.

513
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:53,287
They come in
all different colors,

514
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:55,088
pink, red, white, and black,

515
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,690
and they all
have different flavors.

516
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,458
They're very productive.

517
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:01,862
We tend to eat them fresh
or juice them.

518
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,831
Make them
into fruit leather or jelly.

519
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,367
Black currants have
a very strong flavor.

520
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,702
And I have one bush.

521
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,738
I think we picked
about seven pounds

522
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:15,175
before we got tired of picking
the black currants.

523
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:16,376
There were so many.

524
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,178
But at first,
I didn't like them,

525
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:21,381
and I realized
that if I made jam with them,

526
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:24,518
I could make these lovely little
jam tarts or, like, mini pies,

527
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:27,654
and they're delicious,
they're so tasty.

528
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,523
So sometimes
when you have a food forest,

529
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,158
you have to get creative

530
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:34,728
and, you know,
try out different foods,

531
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:35,896
different ways of cooking,

532
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:39,132
different ways
to prepare your foods,

533
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,235
which I think is
pretty exciting.

534
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,438
Another plant I'd like
to highlight is goumi berry.

535
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:47,574
These will grow
about 6 to 10 feet tall,

536
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:51,245
and they have some thorns,
but they're not like--

537
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:52,412
they're okay to manage.

538
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,580
Like, some thorny plants,

539
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,382
you just kind of
want to stay away from.

540
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,484
But goumi berries
have some thorns.

541
00:26:57,551 --> 00:26:59,853
And, you know, perhaps they
could be a good barrier plant.

542
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,256
If you want to keep
some animals out,

543
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:04,491
you could use them maybe
as a live fencing.

544
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,493
But their berries are delicious,

545
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,764
and they taste a little bit
like Sweet Tart candy, I think.

546
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,766
And those are great for juicing.

547
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,169
I like to use them in juice

548
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:18,705
to make lollipops
and things like that.

549
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:22,910
Lavender is a really nice
small shrub plant,

550
00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:26,380
and there it is growing
with chives.

551
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:31,018
Got some nice textures
going on in the landscape.

552
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,153
Some more shrubs.

553
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,955
Raspberries are fantastic.

554
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,891
I imagine many people here
probably grow them already.

555
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:41,161
But if you have not harvested
the leaves for tea,

556
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:43,363
that's something
you might want to consider.

557
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,500
You can harvest the leaves
before the flowers bloom,

558
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:50,871
so then you're getting two
harvests from this one plant.

559
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,106
Golden raspberries
are especially delicious,

560
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,008
if you have not tried those.

561
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:58,045
Honeyberries
are a fantastic option

562
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:01,114
if you would like
an alternative to blueberries.

563
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:04,818
They're really easy to grow,
they come in a variety of sizes,

564
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:09,456
anywhere from about three feet
up to four or five feet tall.

565
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,191
They're not as sweet
as blueberries,

566
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,160
but they're very productive.

567
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:15,762
They ripen early,
right at the end of May.

568
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,297
And there is one of my kiddos

569
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,700
and our neighbor girl
looking for honeyberries

570
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,803
because they know
that they ripen first.

571
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,672
So they get excited and
head outside and look for them

572
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,741
toward the end of May.

573
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,544
Common sage is a nice
small shrub.

574
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:32,813
There's more sage in my garden

575
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,982
than our whole town
could consume, I think.

576
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,851
But it's great for the
pollinators and to add color

577
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:39,486
and if you want to, you know,

578
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:40,988
bring the flowers
into your house

579
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,790
or do any sort
of craft projects.

580
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:49,396
All right, moving on
to the herbaceous plants.

581
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:50,998
I've got--

582
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,799
there are so many
that I could talk about.

583
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,335
Okay, so I'm gonna start
with borage.

584
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,437
Borage is actually
an annual plant.

585
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:00,407
And I know that I talked a lot
about growing perennial foods.

586
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,109
But the thing I like
about borage

587
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,711
is that it will just
reseed itself

588
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,214
and kind of spread
around the garden,

589
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,082
and it might sound
like a problem,

590
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,853
but food forests can take
some time to get established,

591
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,189
and sometimes, you just
need to fill that space.

592
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,759
So there are certain plants
that I like to just let spread,

593
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,695
and I just enjoy them
as they are in the garden,

594
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,697
and borage is one of them.

595
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,232
The flowers are edible,

596
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,768
and they're just these teeny
little, not too teeny,

597
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,304
but like, these sweet
little blue flowers.

598
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,674
They don't have a very strong
flavor, but they're gorgeous.

599
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,577
You can use them in,
like, decorating cakes.

600
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:38,212
Put them on ice cream.

601
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,013
I like to freeze them
in ice cubes

602
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,083
and have some borage flowers
floating in ice cubes.

603
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,053
So that's one plant
I really love.

604
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,721
There's bee balm.

605
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:51,291
It spreads like crazy, but it
makes a really lovely tea.

606
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,260
And then asparagus.

607
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,996
Perhaps some of you
already grow asparagus,

608
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,898
but it's a really neat plant.

609
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,067
So, after the harvest period,

610
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:04,171
it has these
really ferny frond leaves.

611
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:10,010
Comfrey is another plant
that I love.

612
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:12,379
And this one's great
because it's called,

613
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:15,115
it's what's called
a dynamic accumulator.

614
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:17,184
And that means
that the roots go down,

615
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:19,987
and it really does a good job
of pulling nutrients up

616
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:22,155
from deep within the soil.

617
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:25,692
And then, the beauty of comfrey
is that it has tons of mass

618
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,462
at the top of the plant,
so lots of big leaves.

619
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:30,464
It creates a lot of bulk,

620
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,467
so you can chop it down and
use it as mulch in your garden.

621
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:36,537
So you're cycling
the nutrients

622
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,642
through your garden with plants
like comfrey, for example.

623
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,577
It's also a great
medicinal plant,

624
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:46,213
and the flowers are edible.

625
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,650
Elecampane is one that I love.

626
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:53,453
It's a tall plant, probably,
I don't know,

627
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,256
six to eight feet tall, perhaps.

628
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:57,558
It has large leaves.

629
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,226
It almost looks
kind of tropical,

630
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:02,863
and it has these beautiful
sunflower-ish flowers.

631
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,632
And the roots are medicinal.

632
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,301
So it's a really nice plant

633
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:11,271
to use to make a cough syrup
for the winter.

634
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,974
Cutting celery is a great plant.

635
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,243
I believe it's a biennial.

636
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,713
It has a really nice
strong celery flavor.

637
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,250
I grew a bunch
and blanched it and froze it,

638
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:25,052
and I'm still using it,
like, two years later

639
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:29,256
because one plant produced
so much food.

640
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:32,659
And I just toss it in soups,
and it's great.

641
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,528
It tastes amazing.

642
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,166
Some more plants for the
herbaceous level: horehound.

643
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,635
This one is a nice
medicinal plant.

644
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:44,304
I believe it was used
more in the past

645
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:47,040
for cough drops or lozenges.

646
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:50,477
Lemon balm is a great plant

647
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:53,814
if you're looking for,
just to kind of fill

648
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:57,518
one of those shadier nooks
in the back of your garden,

649
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,686
something that's
a little out of the way.

650
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,054
It'll spread around a bit.

651
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,789
It doesn't need much care,

652
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:05,893
but you can make a lovely tea
out of it.

653
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,161
And then, there's a basket
of assorted herbs,

654
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:09,396
because there are just so many

655
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:13,600
that you could grow
in the herbaceous layer.

656
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,402
Next is motherwort,

657
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:19,373
and I had some laughs yesterday
when I mentioned motherwort.

658
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:23,277
It's kind of a weedy plant,
but it's nice.

659
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:26,246
Like, if you're looking for
some plants for a shadier spot,

660
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:29,183
sometimes there are
already plants growing

661
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:31,018
that are really useful

662
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:34,454
and make a nice addition
to the landscape.

663
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:37,691
So you can make a lovely tea
with motherwort.

664
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,794
Salad burnet is a really cool
perennial edible plant.

665
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,896
You can eat the greens
or the leaves on it.

666
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,432
It tastes like cucumbers.

667
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,135
So you just strip off some
of those leaves

668
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,804
and toss it in a salad
with other greens,

669
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:53,540
and it's a really nice plant.

670
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:55,709
Rhubarb and chives,

671
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,878
which I'm sure you're
all probably familiar with,

672
00:32:57,945 --> 00:33:00,380
but those grow really well
in a food forest.

673
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:03,650
And the rhubarb can
also be a nice mulch-type plant

674
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:05,018
because it has those big leaves.

675
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,888
So you can chop the leaves,
drop 'em in the garden.

676
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:10,290
I know there's one spot that's
kind of bare in my garden.

677
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,693
I keep adding the rhubarb leaves
every year

678
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,563
just to add a little more
organic matter.

679
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,734
Next is yarrow.

680
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,604
This is a native plant.

681
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,672
It's also a medicinal plant.

682
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:28,876
It is awesome for a tea
for fevers.

683
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,212
Great if you're bleeding.

684
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,815
You can take the leaves and,
you know, put it on your cut

685
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:38,485
or put it in your nose
if you have a bloody nose.

686
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,888
And it's one of those plants
that will attract

687
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,390
the pollinators to your garden
as well.

688
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,558
So it's an important one

689
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:48,662
to incorporate in there
in your food forest.

690
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:52,866
Red-veined sorrel is
a really beautiful plant.

691
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:54,501
You can add some leaves,
not too many.

692
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:57,905
You can't eat too much of it
at once.

693
00:33:57,971 --> 00:33:59,706
But it has kind of a,

694
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:02,009
I don't know,
lemony-ish flavor.

695
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,677
And then stinging nettles.

696
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:05,846
Does anyone have a relationship
with stinging nettles,

697
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,347
either good or bad?

698
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:09,750
Yeah, yes, lots of nods.

699
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:12,853
So whether you love them
or don't love them,

700
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,957
stinging nettles can be a really
good addition to a food forest.

701
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:18,725
They like the shade.

702
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,395
So, sometimes it's hard
to find edible plants

703
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,197
that will grow in the shade.

704
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:25,365
Stinging nettle is a good one.

705
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:28,468
You can harvest them
before they flower,

706
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:31,939
so you want to get 'em early
and use 'em for pesto,

707
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:33,674
dry 'em for tea,

708
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:35,475
cook 'em up
like you would spinach,

709
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:38,011
put 'em in an egg scramble.

710
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:40,981
It really makes a lovely,

711
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:44,952
a lovely edible plant
for the food forest.

712
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,456
And now to the
ground cover layer.

713
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,225
Lots of ground covers.

714
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,860
I put mint in there.

715
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,027
I don't know.

716
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,996
Mint is kind of controversial,
I guess.

717
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:57,998
So if you have a place
to let it spread,

718
00:34:58,065 --> 00:35:01,235
it's a great plant
to just fill the space.

719
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,270
You can also grow it in pots.

720
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:06,573
Calendula, I use it similarly
in the garden as I do borage,

721
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,308
so I just let it spread.

722
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,010
So, last year, for example,

723
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:11,512
I don't even remember
what happened,

724
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:12,913
but I had a super busy spring

725
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,183
and I didn't plant my vegetable
garden as I had wanted,

726
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,254
and the calendula just took
over, and it was amazing.

727
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,490
So instead of having
just bare soil,

728
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:26,260
once you create kind of these
communities of plants,

729
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:27,794
things will fill in.

730
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:30,464
And instead of having,
like, weeds you don't want,

731
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,332
you end up with weeds
that you do want.

732
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:36,003
So calendula is kind of
like the weed that I did want,

733
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:37,437
I guess, in my vegetable garden,

734
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:39,506
since I wasn't growing
many vegetables.

735
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:43,310
And these, the petals
of calendula are edible.

736
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,779
And you can also make some
really lovely skincare products

737
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:50,050
with the flowers as well,
among other things.

738
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:51,685
Chickweed is another nice one.

739
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:56,456
That's often just a weedy plant
that will show up.

740
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,992
What else,
aronia berries.

741
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,563
I did not mention those
in the shrub section,

742
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:03,897
but aronia berries are great.

743
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:07,034
Those are often used
in ornamental landscaping,

744
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,536
so perhaps you have them growing
in your yard already

745
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:11,605
or somewhere nearby.

746
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:16,844
They have some berries
in the fall that are edible.

747
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,314
They're not my favorite,
but I had one recently

748
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,450
that someone had just let dry
on their kitchen counter,

749
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:24,985
and it was delicious.

750
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:28,355
So, there's always, like, ways
to incorporate these foods.

751
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,791
So you might already have them
growing in your yard.

752
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:34,194
And you can also get
a ground cover version

753
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,596
of aronia berry as well,

754
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,764
if you're looking
for some more berries

755
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,400
to grow at the ground level.

756
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:45,405
A few more ground covers
to talk about.

757
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:46,807
Sweet woodruff.

758
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:50,644
I've always known that more
as an ornamental ground cover,

759
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,846
and it's one that I like,
I'm not quite sure why.

760
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,715
It has a nice scent to it.

761
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,651
It flowers earlier
in the season.

762
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,653
But I found out recently
that you can cut off

763
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,955
the flowering tops,
like the first few inches,

764
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:05,359
and make a vanilla substitute
with it.

765
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:08,061
So that's what we've
been using all year.

766
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:09,429
I made some last year.

767
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:12,933
You just cut it off,
put it in a jar with some vodka,

768
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,202
and let it sit for a while,
and strain it,

769
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,470
and there you go.

770
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:19,873
It's a really nice,
affordable option

771
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,276
to just do at home easily.

772
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:27,614
Thyme makes a lovely
ground cover in a food forest,

773
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:30,350
and it's also great
at attracting bees

774
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,085
and other insects.

775
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:35,956
And violets might be one of my
all-time favorite ground covers.

776
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:38,992
I just have huge patches
of violets at home.

777
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,729
And I love them because
a lot of reasons.

778
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,232
They're edible,
they're medicinal,

779
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:48,569
you can eat the greens in salad,
like, the young greens.

780
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:52,072
You can harvest the larger
greens and cook with them.

781
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,341
You can dry them for tea.

782
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:58,779
I made this really beautiful
violet flower jelly last year,

783
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,981
I believe,
maybe the year before.

784
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:03,750
And they have some
medicinal properties as well.

785
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:05,085
So that's a great plant,

786
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,287
especially for more,
like, damp areas,

787
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,323
and it really helps
to hold the soil in place

788
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,158
in your food forest.

789
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,563
And next, the root layer.

790
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,234
We've got onions,
potatoes, carrots in this,

791
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,568
and many other things,

792
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,537
but those are
a few to highlight.

793
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:27,541
In my garden,
I have several potato patches.

794
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,843
I like to call them
the perpetual potato patches

795
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,678
because I never
quite harvest them all.

796
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,447
Has anyone else
had that problem?

797
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:34,715
Yes.

798
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:36,450
So instead of fighting it,

799
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,519
I've just kind of learned
to embrace it.

800
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:41,655
And I know where I can go dig
around and find some potatoes.

801
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,724
So in a pinch, I'm like,
"Oh, no, it's dinnertime.

802
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,225
What am I gonna do?"

803
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,894
Okay, I know
by the goumi berries.

804
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,229
Before I planted the goumies
there, there were potatoes,

805
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:51,265
but now they're
still happily growing together,

806
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:55,169
even though I dig around
and get the potatoes out.

807
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:57,471
So that's kind of the beauty
of a food forest.

808
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:01,775
You can let things
kind of evolve on their own.

809
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:05,179
Like, plants will find
where they like to live

810
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:06,580
and grow and thrive,

811
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:09,583
and it's just a matter
of letting it,

812
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,788
letting it kind of be its own,
have its own, I don't know.

813
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:17,891
At a loss for words.

814
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,161
Hopefully you know what I mean.
[chuckles]

815
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:24,231
The next layer
is the vine layer.

816
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,266
Vines are great.

817
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:29,203
I love that you can add these
to your food forest

818
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,372
in all sorts of fun
and beautiful ways.

819
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:35,609
This is a grapevine that's
growing outside of my back door.

820
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:36,777
It's kind of like a,

821
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:39,546
you know, halfway
to the basement back door.

822
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:43,851
But it was just this bare patio,
like, really ugly space,

823
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:47,387
and I put up that trellis,
and there's a grapevine growing,

824
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:48,555
and it's just gorgeous.

825
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:50,490
And it produces so much food.

826
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:55,362
And it was home to a family
of robins in the spring.

827
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,732
So, yeah, just an example

828
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:01,602
of how you can incorporate that
into your landscape.

829
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:04,605
If you're looking for some
annual vines,

830
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:06,306
I love scarlet runner beans.

831
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:07,875
You can eat the flowers.

832
00:40:07,941 --> 00:40:11,678
They taste exactly like beans,
which is pretty wild.

833
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:14,982
You can eat the bean pods
when they're young,

834
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:17,718
and then you can also let
the beans mature

835
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:20,153
and dry on the vine
for dried beans.

836
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,222
And they're big,
so it produce--

837
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:25,993
they will produce
a lot of food just from,

838
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:31,064
you know, not a big patch
of scarlet runner bean vines.

839
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:36,203
Another great vine
that I love is passionflower.

840
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,039
It looks very tropical,
but it will grow in zone five.

841
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,475
I have it in a nice, warm spot
next to my driveway

842
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:44,711
between, like, my driveway
and my house by the front door.

843
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,748
It has a great smell
when it's blooming,

844
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:50,083
and it's just such a cool plant.

845
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,153
It also has fruit that's edible,

846
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,925
although I have not quite
gotten mine that far yet.

847
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:01,128
And it has medicinal properties.

848
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:03,397
Okay, so moving on.

849
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:06,333
I want to talk about
a few common questions

850
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,335
about food forests.

851
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:14,174
So, you might be wondering,
how long will it take

852
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:16,810
for a food forest
to get established?

853
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,545
And it all really depends.

854
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:22,783
So, if you have the budget to
buy larger trees, larger shrubs,

855
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,719
obviously you're gonna get
food sooner than you,

856
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,888
than you would if
you planted some bare-root trees

857
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,623
that are much smaller.

858
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,592
So these are kind of
the earlier numbers.

859
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:34,995
So this is like, if you're
planting the larger plants,

860
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:39,166
you could probably expect
large nut trees to start bearing

861
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,901
at about four years or more.

862
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,604
Fruit and small nut trees,
two years or more.

863
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,706
Berry bushes at a year or more.

864
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:50,511
And all of your perennials
and herbaceous plants, you know,

865
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:55,215
within that same year or so,
depending on the plant.

866
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:57,751
How big does
a food forest need to be?

867
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:58,952
Really any size.

868
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,855
You can have
a tiny little food forest

869
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:04,124
in an urban patch of land.

870
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,093
Just because it's called
a forest doesn't mean

871
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,562
that you have to have
a really large space.

872
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,264
But if you do have
a large space,

873
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,801
you can also plant
a massive food forest as well.

874
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,872
How much food will a
food forest produce?

875
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,909
There was a study in Scotland.

876
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:23,577
There's a link there.

877
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,445
It's "Sustainable
food production

878
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:27,948
in a temperate climate."

879
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:31,151
And what they found was
that a plot

880
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,957
that was about 2.4 acres
produced enough carbohydrates

881
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:40,027
for seven males
or nine females,

882
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:44,464
enough fat
for four males or five females,

883
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:47,801
enough protein for three males
or four females.

884
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:48,969
And then, of course,

885
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:52,005
if you increase
the legumes and nut trees,

886
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:56,176
you can increase the amount
of protein and fat.

887
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:57,578
So what does that mean for you?

888
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:59,379
Kind of taking it down
to a smaller scale

889
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:00,547
'cause that's really,

890
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,916
you know, 2.4 acres,
that's pretty big.

891
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:07,221
So the typical,
or, the average size property

892
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:11,325
in Wisconsin
is about 1,500 square feet.

893
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:13,493
So if you took a third of that,

894
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,764
so 5,000 square feet, and
planted that in a food forest,

895
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:22,469
this is what you could expect
from a food forest of that size.

896
00:43:22,536 --> 00:43:25,873
So carbohydrates for almost
one male or one female,

897
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:30,010
fat for about half of the
fat needs for a male

898
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:32,012
or about two-thirds
for a female,

899
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,483
about half of the protein needs
for a male or a female.

900
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,286
How much sun does a food forest
need?

901
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:40,954
At least six hours.

902
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:43,190
So if you're planning
to grow fruit trees,

903
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:48,729
you need some space that has
at least six hours of sunlight.

904
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:52,032
What are the challenges
to planting

905
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,034
and maintaining a food forest?

906
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:58,071
I think the biggest challenge
is the land and time

907
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,740
and probably money.

908
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,575
I think those would be
the big three.

909
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:04,678
Because it does take time
for the food forest

910
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,580
to become established.

911
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,049
So you need to be committed
to that piece of land

912
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:12,452
and have the patience
to wait for it.

913
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,789
There are things you can do,
you know,

914
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,691
if you plant your fruit trees

915
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,960
and you have a lot
of open space underneath,

916
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:22,396
you could grow squash,
you can grow other vegetables,

917
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:24,331
you can grow medicine.

918
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:26,600
You could put your
annual veggies there.

919
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,169
So there are ways
to use that space

920
00:44:29,236 --> 00:44:32,239
as your food forest is maturing.

921
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,175
Of course, the money up front.

922
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:37,177
So you've got to buy
those trees and shrubs.

923
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,947
They're not cheap,
but you can also do it

924
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,249
on a tighter budget
by starting with smaller plants.

925
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:44,551
Bare-root trees don't cost
quite as much,

926
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:46,820
so that's a great way to go.

927
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:48,722
And then delayed harvests.

928
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,091
It takes a while to get
some fruit from these plants,

929
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:53,393
so you need to be dedicated
and patient,

930
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,863
which can be challenging.

931
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,865
And then, lastly, irrigation.

932
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:59,266
It is important to make sure

933
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:02,302
that your your food forest
is getting watered,

934
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,738
at least until it's established.

935
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:08,709
And then, of course,
if needed after that.

936
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:14,815
So I have just a couple of
final thoughts that I'll read.

937
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,850
My hope is that you gained
a better understanding

938
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:19,486
of food forests
and their benefits

939
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,522
beyond just food production.

940
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,624
I invite you to plant
your own food forest,

941
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,393
work with your community
to install a public food forest,

942
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,063
or simply share your knowledge
and excitement with others.

943
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,902
Let's embrace this opportunity
to cultivate a greener future.

944
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:37,204
