- Hello, and welcome
to <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

23
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,618
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald.

24
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,721
Summer in Wisconsin means
it's berry-picking season,

25
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,523
and I'm ready to head
into the fields

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,593
as we visit Jelli's Market
in Jefferson County.

27
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,294
This family farm
is in Helenville

28
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,831
and sits between I-94
and Highway 18.

29
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,136
Depending on the season,

30
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,873
visitors come to pick
their own blueberries,

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:51,612
raspberries, strawberries,
apples, flowers, or pumpkins.

32
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,349
Husband and wife
Steve and Jody Knoebel

33
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,218
followed in their grandparents'
farming footsteps.

34
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,555
They started their
berry-growing endeavors in 2001

35
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,825
by planting 25,000 strawberries.

36
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,127
They named the farm
Jelli's Market,

37
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,062
combining their daughters'
names:

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,932
Jessica, Lindsay, and Libby.

39
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,803
Now, the daughters who the farm
is named after help to run it.

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,240
Over the years, they grew
to include apple orchards

41
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:25,345
and a commercial kitchen,
baking sweet treats here daily.

42
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,447
I'll head out to pick
blueberries in a bit,

43
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,183
but first, we travel the state

44
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,587
to see what else is popping up
and flourishing.

45
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,558
As we head to Milwaukee,
to uncover the mystery

46
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:42,196
behind some of our state's
most beloved mascots.

47

[crowd cheers]

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,602
- You just kinda
have to move your hands

49
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,270
and hope for the best.

50
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,341
Simply no other job like this
I can think of.

51
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,010
? Flexin' like a winner ?

52
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,445
- The most important thing,
I think,

53
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,180
is to have fun.

54
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,883
? Got it all ?

55
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,952
? Got, got, got it all ?

56
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,923
- So I'm a little bit like a
superhero, in a way. [laughs]

57
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,792
? Winner ?
? Winner ?

58
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,994
- You have everybody
in the stadium

59
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,596
looking at you,
and you just run out.

60
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,333
It's a big responsibility,
I would say.

61
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,871

65
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,467
- Brian Adams: Olympus Mascots
was created

66
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,103
at some point back in the 1960s.

67
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,006
We have 250-ish total employees.

68
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,578
- Amber Micoliczyk:
They reached out to me

69
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,780
and they're like, "Hey, do you
wanna be a mascot sewer?"

70
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,782
And I'm like, "I have never
heard of anything

71
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,352
like that before, so sure,
why not?"

72
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,422
- Brian: We've probably done
25,000 to 30,000 mascots

73
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,291
through the years.

74
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,993
- Steve Deau:
We did a forklift,

75
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,229
like a wearable
forklift costume.

76
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,830
And it had the forks
in the front

77
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,465
that just kinda went up
and down.

78
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,067
And a hidden button
on the other side

79
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,169
for, like, the backup noise.

80
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,705
Full-body robot.

The Racing Sausages
come through here.

83
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:38,545
We probably make new ones every,
I don't know, five years.

84
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,514
- We're working on a
very high-profile project

85
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:44,051
right now
that I can't tell you about.

[machine buzzes]

87
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,059
- Brittany Jacob-Thacker:
Most of our costumes

88
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,196
are in between 60 to 120 hours,
with the average of them

89
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,132
being probably in the
70 to 80-hour range.

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,269
We consider, like, the
performer's activity level.

91
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,238
We go a lot by, like,
height range too

92
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,007
to make sure it fits, like, a
certain height range of person.

93
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,208
There's a lot
of different aspects

94
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,277
that all kinda go into it.

95
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:13,847
- So when I see the picture,
I have to navigate

96
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,917
how I'm going to make this
a 3D thing.

97
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,754
I go on to the mannequin,
I start measuring out things

98
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,524
so that I know what the
proportions are

99
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,693
so I know how to make something
what it should look like

100
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,428
on the form.

101
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,399
- Brittany:
So, a lot of it's fur.

102
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,801
We have fur, Tempo, double knit

103
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,171
are probably the big ones
that we use.

104
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,006
I particularly like
when we do fur costumes

105
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,008
just 'cause it's cool to put
different colors together

106
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,444
and different textures.

of customers

109
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,251
every single year.

Pro sports teams,

? Give it to me,
give it to me ?

117
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,145
? Give it to me,
whoo! ?

118
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,217
? Give it, give it,
give it to me ?

119
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,620
? Give it, give it to me ?

120
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,996
- It's very strange, sometimes,
to just be like,

121
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,998
watching a Packer game
or something,

122
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,167
and a commercial comes on
and it's like,

123
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,468
"Oh, I made that," you know?

124
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,238
It's like, you know, it gives me
a certain level of pride

125
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,242
and just, like, this costume
made it onto TV

126
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,745
and looks pretty good.
[chuckles]

127
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,547
- John Sidem: Feels like
art come to life.

128
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,116
Like, our art that
we're working on here,

129
00:06:56,183 --> 00:07:01,088
you know, becomes this
full-scale, realized thing.

130
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,392
? Whoo! ?

131
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,361
- And then, it's like,

132
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,296
you forget about
all of that hard work,

133
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,765
and you're like, "Wow, like,
this is what

134
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,168
it comes down to at the end."

- Brittany: The people that
work here are just amazing.

It's the reason why I come back
every day.

137
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,607
It's the reason why
I have a smile on my face.

138
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,043
It's the reason why I love
coming to work

139
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,545
because it's a great group
of people

140
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,413

really fun stuff.

- Rachel Ristow:
It's been around forever.

147

It's like this big,

at the Plymouth Tap.

162
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,281
- When I first started
playing in 2019,

163
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:38,318
there were no games
basically in Sheboygan County,

164
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,953
and now, we have a place
like here.

I think he's got 12 games.

- Angela: Rachel's heart pumps

167
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,293
on the unpredictable
fun of pinball.

168
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,461
- Good game.

169
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,663
I missed my extra ball.

170
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,634
One ball to win 'em all.

171
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,602
- Angela: She is a paralegal
by day

00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,239
and a pinball fanatic all day,
any day.

232 million,
I'll take that any day.

176
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,216
That was a good game.

Rachel founded
Ladies Flip Wisconsin,

179
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,559
a statewide club helping women
take the pinball plunge.

180
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,894
- Rachel: Women's pinball is
a whole different vibe.

181
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,763
- All right,
now I'm done. [laughing]

182
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,232
- The pinball community is
pretty incredible.

183
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,368
It's made up of all sorts of
people from all walks of life.

184

- Angela: Home base
for Ladies Flip Wisconsin

185
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,739
is the Diamond Plate Arcade.

186

It's a unique private collection
near De Pere.

187
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,078
Pinball is also a place

188
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:42,482
for these women to connect,
converse, and compete.

- Recording: Please welcome,
from Hollywood, Guns N' Roses!

191
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,859
- Yeah, whoo!

192
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,995
Women's pinball creates
a safe space for women

193
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,231
in the hobby
so that they can learn

194
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,366
and so that they can feel
supported.

195
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,436
I've been able to meet
so many new people in my life.

196
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,505
A lot of folks,
I think, struggle with,

where do you meet new friends at
different stages in your life?

198
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,243
I'm in my 40s.

199
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,545
I don't have children,
I'm divorced.

200
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,046
Women's pinball is
really important.

201
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,715
It's very important to me.

202
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,518
- Angela: On this evening,
Rachel has organized

203
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,887
a women's pinball boot camp.

204
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,922
- Welcome
to Ladies Flip Spooky Season.

Yay!
[group cheering]

206
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,225
This is something new
that I started doing last year

207
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,028
because we wanna build
your skills.

208
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,930
- Hey!
- Hey!

209
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,766
- I love to think about
pinball as controlling chaos

210
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,869
when you're able to find
the skills to control the ball.

211
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,038
- Player: No, no.
- Group: Yay!

212
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,007
- Rachel: That's what
I'm talking about.

213
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,744
You're able to score
and have a bigger game

214
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,679
and more points,
and you can win the game.

215
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,415
- Angela: Winning isn't
everything, but for Rachel,

216
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,950
it is a close second.

217
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,151
- Rachel: I've never
been competitive

218
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,654
about anything in my life
until I met pinball.

219
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,355
Get in there,
you little jerkface.

220
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,691
I played a couple of women's
world championships.

221
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,660
My current open women's
world ranking,

222
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,296
I think, is 25th overall
in the world.

223
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,631
I ended last year at 13th.

224
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,937
I think that,
in Ladies Flip Wisconsin,

225
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,272
we have some
very competitive players

226
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,708
and other players
that don't care at all.

227
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,177
- Angela: This magical box
with flashing lights

228
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,913
is more than a game for Rachel.

229
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,515
- Rachel: Because you get
into this hobby

230
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,418
and then you meet people
that just become your friends,

231
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,754
and it becomes more
than just pinball.

232
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,756
It gives me the feeling
of, like,

233
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,794
I have always a woman
in my corner looking out for me.

234
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,062
It makes me happy.

[bells chiming]

00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,899
That's pinball.

237
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,101
That's pinball, baby.

238
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,271
- I'm in Helenville
at Jelli's Market,

239
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,706
learning about one
of Wisconsin's

240
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:50,544
favorite summertime activities:
berry picking.

[lively music]

242
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,048
I sat down with Libby,

243
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,451
whose parents bought this farm
in the '80s

244
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:01,555
but didn't start
strawberry farming 'til 2001.

245
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,156
- Libby Hafften: They've got
a little bit

246
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,324
of farming background,

247
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,226
but kind of jumped
into strawberries headfirst.

248
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,563
Didn't really know anything
they were doing,

249
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,099
but it's kind of exploded
since then, obviously.

250
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:17,838
And now we have blueberries and
raspberries, apples, pumpkins.

251
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,706
One thing for sure
that makes us unique

252
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,009
is we don't have
an admission fee.

253
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,078
That is one thing that my
parents really were against

254
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,246
when they decided

255
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,248
that they wanted to be more
of a u-pick farm

256
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,118
and let people come
and get their own produce.

257
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:34,221
It's just nice that
we allow people to come

258
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,989
and just hang out
if they want to

259
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,293
and be in agriculture
and be away from the city

260
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,362
and learn something new
while they're here.

261
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,530
- Customer: Thank you.

262
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,731
- That's truly creating a space

263
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,733
for the community.
- Yeah.

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,603
People can come in the
farm store and buy meat

265
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,740
like pork and beef and lamb,
chicken, turkeys.

266
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,844
And then any
of our other products.

267
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,046
- Angela: There's an array
of different food items

268
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,648
that people can enjoy fresh
throughout the year.

269
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,917
- Libby: Absolutely.
- Well, welcome.

270
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,319
Thanks for coming.

271
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,321
- So you and your sister still
run the farm?

272
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,655
- Yes.

273
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,059
My sister Lindsay and I
co-manage Jelli's together now.

274
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,162
She does a lot of the berries
and the vegetables.

275
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,531
I'm mainly in charge
of our orchard.

276
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:20,334
So I get to work with not only
my sister, but my best friend.

277
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,736
And, you know,
we get sick of each other

278
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,639
and bicker like sisters do,
but at the end of the day,

279
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,441
we both want our business
to succeed

280
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,209
and we want to make
our family better,

281
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,179
so we have the same goal
in mind.

282
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,881
- Angela: I love that.

283
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,682
And you're able to continue
your family's legacy together.

284
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,984
- Libby: Yes, exactly.

285
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,785
- So, Libby, I do want to go out

286
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:39,987
and pick some blueberries
with you.

287
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,388
- Okay.
- Before we do that,

288
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:42,990
is there anything I should keep
in mind?

289
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,157
Anything unique
about blueberry picking

290
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,392
for a first-time
blueberry picker?

291
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,861
- [laughs] Well, what color
are blueberries?

292
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,897
- They're blue.
- They are blue, that's good.

293
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,732
So we should probably make sure

294
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,433
we don't pick any green ones,
right?

295
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,469
- Okay, I'm assuming that means
they're not ready, or?

296
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,070
- That would be correct.
- Okay, okay.

297
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,239
That's good to know.
- That's the biggest tip.

298
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,241
- Make sure they're blue
at the time of picking.

299
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,409
- Yes.

300
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,911
And other than that,
it's pretty easy.

301
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,078
- Okay, awesome.

302
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,680
Well, can you go show me?
- Absolutely!

303
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,415
- Thank you.

304
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,387
With my first blueberry
picking lesson under my belt,

305
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,589
we headed out to the field.

306
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,090
With a little help.

307
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,394
So which ones feel ripe
for picking over here?

308
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,796
- Well, we want the blue ones.

309
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,432
- Angela: And a taste or two.

310
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,468
- You wanna try one?
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,770
These are good.
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:32,039
And we allow people to, y'know,
eat while they pick.

313
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,440
That's part of the fun.
- Aww.

314
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:38,745
- Part of the experience.
- I'm sure that's appreciated.

315
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,382
Whether in the field
or in the shop,

316
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:48,288
Jelli's Market offers a tasty
way to enjoy a Wisconsin summer.

317
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,023
[gentle music]

318
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:57,497
Now, we hop over to another
Wisconsin farm in Verona,

319
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,702
where one grower cultivates
a taste of home.

320
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,273
[gentle music]

321
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:11,011
It's a sunny fall day
on this rural Verona farm.

322
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,983
Juan Gonzalez is
pulling up the papalo.

323
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,486
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

324
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:21,188
- Angela: And picking
the purslane.

325
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,390
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

326
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:24,992
- Angela: These herbs are not
typically grown

327
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:29,296
in Wisconsin farms,
making them hard to find.

328
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,765
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

329
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:34,101
- Angela: But for Mexican
immigrants like Juan,

330
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:37,671
they are a taste of home,
especially for those

331
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,840
from the state of Puebla.

332
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,909
- [speaking Spanish]

333
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,217
- Angela: To get to the point
where Juan is today,

334
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:54,154
growing herbs for himself
and others, has been a journey.

335
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,356
From the rancho where
he was raised

336
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,226
to the farm fields of the West.

337
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,630
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

338
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,238
- Angela: To a chance encounter
on a Madison city bus

339
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,440
more than 20 years ago.

340
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,543
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

341
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,512
- Angela: But to grow from hobby
gardener to full-time farmer

342
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:56,183
would take time, and an
unlikely friendship.

343
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,519
Juan told the community
garden director

344
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,054
he sought larger fields
to grow more.

345
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,690
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

346
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,905
- Seth Riley: Linda and
Gene Farley lived on this land.

347
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,506
They were radically
generous people

348
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:22,509
who opened up their home
and their property

349
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:25,646
to farmers who were
looking for space to grow.

350
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,948
- Angela: Gene and Linda Farley
spent their first years

351
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,684
after med school together
tending to the needs

352
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,787
of the Navajo in the Southwest.

353
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,056
Then they brought their
spirit of public service

354
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,824
to southern Wisconsin.

355
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,427
Eventually, they met Juan.

356
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,429
- He knew Linda and Gene

357
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,365
before our program
and organization was started,

358
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,602
and he worked with Gene
to develop the incubator farm,

359
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,605
what would become
our collaborative farm.

360
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,041
- Angela: Today, the Farleys'
farm continues

361
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:58,879
what was started with Juan,
a path to agriculture production

362
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,415
for dedicated newcomers.

363
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,285
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

364
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,592
- Angela: Like Juan, many of the
aspiring farmers

365
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,993
have been immigrants.

366
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,897
- People have come from all
over, many from Latin America,

367
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:21,001
as well as a lot of people from
Southeast Asia and West Africa.

368
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,537
- Angela: Many more
come on tours.

369
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,539
They learn about
the farmer program

370
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:30,544
and the organic and sustainable
practices the farm employs.

371
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,547
Through a translator, Juan talks
about his specialty crops.

372
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,315
- But then, you also have,
like, purslane...

373
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,818
- Angela: The number
of familiar plants from home

374
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,853
Juan has brought to Wisconsin

375
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,390
has added new flavor
to the community.

376
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,459
- [speaking Spanish]

377
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:59,673
- Angela: El Sabor de Puebla,
literally "the flavor of Puebla"

378
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,310
is the restaurant
owned by Juan's sister.

379
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,779
She's a big customer
for his produce,

380
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:08,415
including flowers that
will decorate the ofrenda

381
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,050
in the lobby.

382
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,686
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

383
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,024
- Angela: On Halloween Day

384
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,459
at the Centro Hispano
Farmers' Market,

385
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,930
Juan's vegetable stand
has plenty of marigolds

386
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,633
for use the next day,
the Day of the Dead.

387
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,303
Flowers and other tributes
will fill these

388
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,906
altars of remembrance
to those now gone.

389
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,576
And in the highest perch
of honor at the restaurant

390
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,878
are the Doctors Farley.

391
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,914
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

392
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,936
- Angela: No doubt Los Abuelos
Farley would be happy

393
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:06,139
with all their farm
has provided.

394
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:09,076
- Juan: [speaking Spanish]

395
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:21,855
[gentle music]

396
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,963
- Angela: Our last story
is a spooky one,

397
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,400
as we meet a Madison couple
who's making it their business

398
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,136
to terrify their customers.

399
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,811
- BJ Winslow: I feel like every
place has a spooky factor.

400
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:48,882
But I do find it is unique here
in Wisconsin.

401
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,553
- Eileen Winslow: There's
definitely a weird factor.

402
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,623
It's something that we enjoy
tapping into.

403
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,426
Hi, I'm Eileen Winslow.
- And I'm BJ Winslow.

404
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:02,029
- And we run Dapper Cadaver.

405
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,998
[spooky music]
[prop shrieks]

406
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:10,671
- Who wants to play a funny
little trick tonight? [laughs]

407
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,877
- We make and provide
death-related props and decor

408
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,280
for a number of industries,
including productions,

409
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:24,551
attractions, and educational
facilities worldwide.

410
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,019
- BJ: We also have the shop.

411
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:29,823
We're located here
in Madison, Wisconsin.

412
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,392
We do stuff that is, like,
Halloween characters

413
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,394
that you're gonna see
in a haunted house

414
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,829
or an amusement park.

415
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,765
And then we also do realistic
dummies for film and television.

416
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,668
- We've provided things
for <i>American Horror Story,</i>

417
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,304
<i>Law and Order, 911, Shogun.</i>

418
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:50,811
- We start
with a liquid material.

419
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:55,015
Urethane, polyurethane,
polyfoam, silicone.

420
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:59,953
We've got a fab team that are
gonna be filling the molds.

421
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,222
A lot of our molds
are realistic heads,

422
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,891
are realistic bodies
and body parts.

423
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:07,661
Those are life cast
off of actual people.

424
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:08,896
Once it's all set up,

425
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:11,999
the liquid material
becomes an expanding foam.

426
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,069
So a small piece can be set
in, like, an hour

427
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,938
and a larger piece over four.

428
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,741
And then, you know, once it's
all set up,

429
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,478
you can crack open the mold,
pull it out,

430
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,247
brush the skin layers,

431
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:31,218
and you've got yourself
a realistic body.

432
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:34,721
- Eileen: I'm originally from
Milwaukee, south side.

433
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,456
- BJ: I'm originally
from California.

434
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,792
I grew up
in northern California.

435
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,161
I've been making things
for as long as I can remember.

436
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,696
- I had graduated

437
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:45,299
from the University
of Southern California.

438
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,134
We met through friends in LA.

439
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,536
It was actually right after BJ
had moved down

440
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,205
from northern California.

441
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:55,609
And I started doing props
after I got out of college,

442
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,845
working at another guy's shop.

443
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,080
And I wanted to branch out
on my own,

444
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,482
and, y'know, we were able to.

445
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,551
[spray paint hissing]

446
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:07,421
- BJ was making props
in our garage,

447
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:10,324
and then I had helped him
set up a website,

448
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,794
'cause actually at that point,
I worked in internet marketing.

449
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,095
- And that was huge.

450
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,464
Nobody else was doing prop shop
websites at the time.

451
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,066
- It started to grow
to the point

452
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,300
where then,
it wasn't sustainable

453
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,469
to keep doing it from the house.

454
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:26,607
We started the business,
we got married,

455
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,109
went on a honeymoon, came back,
and then--

456
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:32,179
- And opened.
- And opened, yeah.

457
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:36,450
We moved back here
in fall of 2020.

458
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,021
We really like the business
environment in Wisconsin.

459
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,189
There you go.

460
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,590
- Customer: Thank you.
- Thank you.

461
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:46,360
It's really great for the bulk
of what we do,

462
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,795
which is manufacturing.

463
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,697
When we were moving,
there was no guarantee

464
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:54,434
that people would continue
calling us.

465
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,739
And we're just extremely happy
and grateful that they did.

466
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,940
It's been a leap of faith

467
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:02,342
in terms of continuing
to grow the business

468
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,211
in new ways as well.

469
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:07,881
- We've done a number of dummies

470
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,284
for UW-Platteville
forensic training.

471
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,885
These are people
that are going to school

472
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,987
to become
forensic investigators.

473
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:17,791
And we recently did
a brand-new type of dummy

474
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:22,095
where it has lividity
that's like bruising.

475
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:24,898
It will actually bleach
when you touch it

476
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,233
and then go back to pink,

477
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,205
so we developed a type of paint
that does that as well.

478
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:34,608
It's nice to go into work and
have, like, both sides of things

479
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:37,578
where it's like, "Today, I'm
gonna do something really stupid

480
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,745
and I'm gonna love it,"

481
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,180
or "Today, I'm gonna do
something

482
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,482
that could save lives."

483
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,854
In the fall, we like
to do the night market.

484
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,589
There we go, cool.

485
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,592
We like to put out one
of our great characters.

486
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,128
And people love to take their
pictures with 'em.

487
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:57,331
And that's always fun.

488
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:02,536
We do September and October here
'cause that's our season.

489
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:05,072
- One of the things I loved
with working with BJ

490
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,573
well over a decade now

491
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,077
is just seeing him grow
as an artist and as a person.

492
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:14,147
- Yeah, I can't imagine
doing this on my own.

493
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:18,652
- I love working
with creative people

494
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:22,422
and I love working with people
that are helping other people.

495
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,525
If you can do that for a living,

496
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,927
what else can you ask for
in life?

497
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:29,997
- Yeah, and it's fun.

500
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:49,116
- We've got a taste
of Jelli's Market in Helenville

501
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:51,318
while sharing stories
of people and places

502
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,854
that make our state sweet.
