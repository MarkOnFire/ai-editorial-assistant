41
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,855
in the tourist town
Frankenmuth, Michigan.

42
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,657
It is all things German here.

43
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,825
How German is it?

44
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,961
Well, the only official
sanctioned Oktoberfest

45
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,797
outside of Munich, Germany,
it's here.

46
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,300
Frankenmuth has
a population of 5,100,

47
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,403
but in the summer,
it's so much bigger.

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,540
It's here in Michigan's
Lower Peninsula,

49
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,110
in the middle of
the eastern half of Michigan,

50
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,880
and it's about 120 miles
east of Grand Rapids

51
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,382
and 80 miles due north

Emmy, I thought since you were
going to be doing history,

55
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,924
we'd be in
a big, great beer hall

56
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,193
with men in Lederhosen

57
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,528
and pretzels
the size of my head.

58
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,430
- Emmy Fink:
That sounds perfect.
- John: Yeah!

59
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,065
- Emmy: I didn't know
it was an option.

60
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,333
- John: Could have been.

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,335
- Emmy: But I brought you here
because this spot is

62
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,503
really where it all began.

63
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,871
So, look behind us.

64
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,907
This log cabin is a replica
of the very first structure,

65
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,509
which happened
to be a church

66
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,945
that was ever built
in Frankenmuth.

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,181
Settlers came over in 1845
from Franconia, Germany.

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,716
- John: Why did they come here?

69
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,185
- Emmy: Well, the first
15 original settlers

70
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,486
were all missionaries.

71
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,722
They wanted to create an
all-German Lutheran community.

72
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,658
- John: Well, it's quite
a journey to come all that way

73
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,194
and to start, like, a community
from scratch.

74
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,996
- Emmy: I mean, really,
you think about it,

75
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,331
it's so courageous.
- John: Yeah.

76
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,532
- Emmy: And the word courage is

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,933
actually how the town got
its name.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,469
So <i>Franken</i> represents Franconia,

79
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,105
and <i>Muth</i> is German
for "courage."

80
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,541
So, it stands for the courage
of the Franconians.

81
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,709
Isn't that neat?

82
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,277
- John: Is there still
a congregation?

83
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,678
- Emmy: There is.

84
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,680
So, the St. Lorenz community is
still alive and well.

85
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,682
And, get this: once a month,
they have a service

86
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,150
that's done
completely in German.

87
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,385
- John: It makes sense.

88
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,187
There should be a German service
here in Frankenmuth,

89
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,489
don't you think?
- Emmy: I know, there should be.

90
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,657
And while we're here,

91
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,659
I was thinking
we should try to get to church.

92
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,329
- John: Do you speak German?

00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,567
- John: I'm at Bronner's
CHRISTmas Wonderland,

95
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,770
and that's all I can think of
is, "I can't wait for
Christmas."

96
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,938
Let's talk your history.

97
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,673
Because this is
your family's store.

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,208
- Carla Bronner Spletzer: It is.
Yeah.

99
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,610
- John: How did this happen?
- Carla: My dad started it

100
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,546
just when
he got out of high school,

101
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,482
and he painted signs
and did window displays

102
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,285
for people around town
and around the area.

103
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,520
And then,
one year for Christmas,

104
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,889
they wanted
some decorative scenes

105
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,326
to hang from their street posts
in the city.

106
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,827
Next year, they wanted more.

107
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,931
A few other people said,
"Hey, we'd like some of that
for our city."

108
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,500
And as these different
city committees and groups

109
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,968
would get together,
and they said,

110
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,736
"Well, don't you have
any Christmas decorations

111
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,638
for the home?"
He said, "Well, no."

112
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,975
And it all started evolving
from there.

113
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,977
- John: And square footage-wise,
what do you have here?

114
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,446
- Carla: It's the size of
1 1/2 football fields

115
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,115
for the public area,
for the store area.

116
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,884
And the whole building is

117
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,886
the size of
five football fields.

118
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,287
- John: It's remarkable!
- Carla: Yeah.

119

We're only closed four days.

00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,568

have a selection.

- Carla: Oh, our buyers
do a great job, yeah.

128
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,074

much of your business?

- Carla: Yes, yeah.
- John: Yeah.

130
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,644
- Carla: We have thousands
of styles of ornaments,

131
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,714
and many of them can be
personalized while you wait.

132
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,282
- John: What are you painting
today?

133
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,017
- I'm going to paint
Main Streets.

134
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,485
- John: You are?
- Yes.

135
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,587
It's a tradition
with a lot of families.

136
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,222
- John: And this is freehand,
isn't it?

137
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,590
- Yes, it is.

138
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,360
- John: Did you go to
a parochial school or something?

139
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,428
- Actually, I did.
- John: Did you?

140
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,365
- Carla: One year, Dad painted
the names of the kids

141
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,567
on ornaments as a gift
at the Christmas party.

142
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,636
- John: Nice.
- So then, people...

143
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,838
"Well, we'd like to get
some of those for our family."

And you did it
in no time.

You're dealing with the happiest
time of the year for all of us.

- John: You know,

149
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,616
but your dad didn't set out
saying,

150

"I want the largest
Christmas store in the world."

He never, in his wildest dreams,
thought it would ever grow

153

to be the world's
largest Christmas store.

00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,898
- Emmy: After Bronner's,

157
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,501
make your way here
to the Silent Night Chapel.

158
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:11,371
This is a replica of
the original chapel in Austria,

159
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,575
where "Silent Night,"
or "Stille Nacht,"

160
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,044
was first sung
back in 1818.

161
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,847
So the story goes,
the chapel's organ broke

162
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,315
right before Christmas.

163
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,251
So the pastor asked his friend,
Franz Gruber,

164
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,221
if he would write a melody
for "Silent Night."

165
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,489
"Silent Night"
is the most recorded song

166
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,191
in the entire world.

167
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,528
And Wally Bronner built this
to give thanks

168
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,930
for all of his blessings.

169
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,600
- John: I am in the middle
of Frankenmuth

170
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,103
in between this town's
two biggest icons,

171
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,707
Zehnder's Restaurant
and the Bavarian Inn restaurant.

172
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,178
Different themes, but they have
almost the same chicken dinner.

173
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,679
Very friendly competition.

174
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,548
Why? Because
it's the same family.

175
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,283
They're cousins.

176
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,586
I don't know which one
to have first.

177
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,388
[upbeat guitar]

178
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,924
We're standing in front of your
iconic business--

179
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,759
"Zehnder's famous
chicken dinners."

180
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,763
- Al Zehnder: Yes. Our family
came here in 1846.

181
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,998
In the 1900s,

182
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,033
the New Exchange Hotel
was built.

183
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,370
And that's the building that
my grandfather bought in 1928,

184
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,971
and we opened in 1929.
- John: Wow!

185
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,573
- Al: We've been here
a long time.

186
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,575
- John: What generation are you?
- Al: I'm number three.

187
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,577
- John: You're number three?
- Al: I'm number three.

188
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,547
And we're proud to have
many of our fourth generation

189
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,115
in the business currently.

190
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,983
- John: So you've known this
your whole lives?

191
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,486
- Yeah, started picking up trash
in the parking lot

192
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,820
when I was ten years old.

193
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,489
- John: I bet you did.

194
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,291
- So, my first job was
the junior hostess.

195
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,792
- John: There we go.
Future looks good to me.

196
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,993
- Al: They look good, yup.

197
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,562
Very proud of them.
- John: That's nice.

198
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,729
So, it's a big restaurant.

199
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,131
- Al: 1,500 seats.
We call it--

200
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,133
- John: Say it again.
- Al: 1,500 seats.

201
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,402
We call it America's
largest family restaurant.

202
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,636
- John: That's a big restaurant!

203
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,038
- Al: That's a big restaurant,
yeah.

204
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,439
- John: This isn't
your only operation.

205
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,607
- Al: No, it's not.

206
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,844
Zehnder's Splash Village
opened in 2005,

207
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,248
and it was so successful that
by 2015, we opened phase two.

208
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,116
And then, we have
The Fortress Golf Course.

209
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,952
- John: Oh, the golf course
as well, yeah.

210
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,454
- Al: Yeah. We opened in 1992
as an 18-hole facility.

211
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,456
- John: Will you take me for
a walk around?

212
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,458
- Al: I'd be happy to.
- John: OK, good.

213
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,126
Holy man!
What?!

214
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,928
You go, girl.

215
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,331
- Al: I started right here
when I was 14 years old.

216
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,732
75¢ an hour.
I'll never forget it.

217
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,900
- John: Right, right.

218
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,702
- Al: Let's go this way.
- John: OK.

219
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,904
- Al: Mind steps?
- John: This is like a city.

220
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,106
- Al: When I started here,
it was just a restaurant.

221
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,307
And I knew early on that

222
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,142
if we're just
going to be a restaurant,

223
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,845
we won't be
exciting enough or big enough.

224
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,081
And most of our retail,
Zehnder's Marketplace,

225
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,949
is located on the lower level
of Zehnder's.

226
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,618
- John: Wait, what?

227
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,353
[guitar]

228
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,456
Did you have any idea? Ha ha!
This is a lot.

229
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,157
- Al: Yeah, it's a lot.

230
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,227
- John: Your name
is everywhere! Ha ha!

231
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,462
You know what I'd love?

232
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,664
I'd love to sit down and have
a piece of chicken.

233
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,832
- Al: Let's do it.

234
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,534
This is our basic
family-style chicken dinner.

235
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,868
- John: Nice.

236
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,737
- Al: We treat gravy
as a beverage.

237
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:00,474
- John: [Laughs]
Can I get a cup, please?

238
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,678
- Al: My cousin, who was
our executive chef for years,

239
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:10,050
he always characterized us
as the capital of comfort food.

240
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,753
We have generations of guests
who've been here for so long,

241
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,490
you get to know them.
- John: Right, family dinner.

242
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,858
This is nice.

243
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,359
The entire operation
is really impressive.

244
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,761
- Al: Thank you.
- John: Yeah.

245
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,062
To you and your family.

246
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,264
Thank you so much for opening
your doors to us today.

247
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,066
- Al: My pleasure. Thank you.
- John: Thanks.

248
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,601
This was a treat.

249
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,703
John: This is
the Frankenmuth Riverwalk.

250
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,407
It makes its way along
the Cass River, and a great way

251
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,243
to experience the waterway
is the "Bavarian Belle."

252
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,345
It's a two-story paddle boat,

253
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,147
and you can get on there
for an hour

254
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:43,116
to take a cruise
through downtown on the river.

255
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,319
If you're looking for a little
family fun while you're here--

256
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,520
and when I say family fun,

257
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,222
I'm talking about
keeping your kids busy,

258
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,090
so you can do a little more
shopping--

259
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:54,094
there are
over 40 gnomes in Frankenmuth

260
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,430
in shops and attractions,

261
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,933
so come to the Visitor Center,
get your scavenger hunt list,

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,302
and send your kids
gnome hunting.

263
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:05,706
I'd like to find
a few gnomes myself.

264
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,909
I am at Star of the West
Milling Company.

265
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,711
You can't miss this
when you're in town.

266
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,012
- Mike Fassezke: You can't.

267
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,981
We are one of the founding
stories of Frankenmuth.

268
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,817
We're 154 years old this year.

269
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,286
We've been in this location
since 1910,

270
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,855
and the city
basically grew up around us.

271
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,825
We have five flour mills.
This is our flagship plant.

272
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,326
This is where
we got our start.

273
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:30,430
We produce about 3.3 million
pounds of flour a day

274
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,599
out of the five flour mills.
- John: A day.

275
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,201
- Mike: In this part of
the state,

276
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,070
we grow a soft white wheat,
which is a specialty wheat,

277
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,673
a boutique wheat
that the cereal industry likes.

278
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,075
Because soft white wheat
has been in Michigan

279
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,111
for hundreds of years...
- John: Yeah.

280
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:47,247
- Mike: ...the cereal industry
kind of dovetailed with that

281
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,216
and located here back
in the day.

282
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,618
- John: A farmer who grows this
brings it here and...

283
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,921
- Mike: He does. Yeah.
- John: And then what happens?

284
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,622
- Mike:
That's just the beginning.

285
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:59,126
The process of milling flour
today is simple,

286
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,761
but it's very difficult.

287
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,763
- John: This is a feat
of engineering, isn't it?

288
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,932
- Mike: Ohh, unbelievable!
Yeah.

289
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,099
There are three basic steps.

290
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,901
First of all,
you have to clean the wheat.

291
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,069
- John: Wow!

292
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,470
- Mike: This is
an optical sorter...

293
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,940
And the cleaning process is
very sophisticated.

294
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,475
It's a camera system that looks
at every kernel of wheat

295
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,711
and makes sure
it's the right color

296
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,713
before the milling process
begins.

297
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,115
So, every one of those
kernels is being looked at,

298
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,218
and that just--
that amazes me.

299
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,620
- Mike: Number two is you have
to reduce the particle size

300
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,955
or grind the wheat.

301
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,124
This wheat has already been
through the cleaning house.

302
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,427
And the rolls, because they're
spinning at different speeds,

303
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,029
doesn't crush it,
it shears it open,

304
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,865
and that releases flour.

305
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,300
You know, I always check that
it gets a little bit cleaner.

306
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,203
Our attempt is to just
slowly scrape that flour off

307
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,671

- John: OK.

308
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,673
- Mike: And number three is you
have to separate

309
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,742
the different streams.

310
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,011
So, what's happening
in those sifters,

311
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,747
you've got a very coarse screen
at the top,

312
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,749
and the product
makes its way down,

313
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,018
and it's distributed
to the proper roll stand

314
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,586
for further reduction.

315
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,289

at the state fair.

- Mike: It's all about
technology.

318
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,262
It's all about being able
to put more through

319
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,664
in the space that you have.

320
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,900
So, right here,
we fill the bag with flour

321
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,301
or any other product we make.

322
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,670
And then it's stacked
robotically at the end.

323
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,705
So, everything that you see here
is going to ship

324
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,107
probably in the next 24 hours.

325
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,575
- John: You've been here
how long?

326
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,443
- Mike: 47 years...
- John: 47 years.

327

college.

328

- Mike: It did.

329
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,349
It's been a good ride.

330
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,918

331

under that impressive
banner sign every year.

332
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,024
And it says <i>Willkommen,</i>
which means "welcome" in German.

333
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,026
What do you think it says
on the other side?

have you been doing this?

I've been doing this.

345
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,688
The store has been here
for 40 years.

346
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,289
- John: Let's talk
cuckoo clocks.

347
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,892
So, what is the tradition
of cuckoo clocks?

348
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,360
- Greg: In the wintertime,

349
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,895
there wasn't really
anything to do.

350
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,396
So, the farmers
would start making clocks

351
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,599
during the wintertime so that
they could make extra money.

352
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,067
- John: Yeah.

353
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,336
- Greg: And so, they started
simple, like, with, you know,

354
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,004
five leaves
and a little bird on top.

[cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo]

And then, they would start
to have a little bit more fun.

357
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,178
So that's called
a "feeding birds."

358
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,348
You know, it would be fun if the

This is actually the most
popular clock that we sell.

362
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,258
When you have things like this,

363
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,194
there is a lot of
mechanical work on the inside.

364
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,996
- John: Do you repair clocks
here as well?

- Greg: Yeah,
full-service repair.

There's not a lot of people
that do it anymore.

- John:
Because they've worn out?

370
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,742

change the oil in your car,

you're not going to have a car

do you have here?

When I first came here,

I saw it and heard it play,
and I was just--

That was it.
I was done.

383

- John: Can you talk about
the pine cones?

384
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,667
- Greg: Those are weights.
This is what powers the clock.

385
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,603
So that's what makes it cuckoo
and keep time and play music.

that are sold out of this store,

When the store opened in 1984,
the original owner,

Mike Nestell, he said, "I used
to deliver them four at a time."

I mean, now-- what he had
in the store then--

398
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,897
I don't even think there's
that many different models

and I'll play.

- Greg: These are called
German pyramids.

404
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,206
And the heat from the candles
rises

405
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,843
and it makes the fans spin,
which makes the scene turn.

406

So, these are German smokers.

00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,314
And you put a little
cone-shaped incense there,

and you light it, and the smoke
will come out of his mouth.

It was built in 1862.

00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,242
It is the state's
oldest brewery,

420
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,212
and the locals
tell me that it was built

421
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,281
because people needed
a place to go after church.

I mean, some do brunch,
some do coffee, some do beer.

they bring you the wool,

00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,975
and you do the rest?

- Abby: This is how it comes.

And so, anything
that's in the barnyard,

it's probably in that wool.

So, we fill the bathtub
with 180-degree hot water.

Then we throw in some wool,

in this machine here,

00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,405
which is called an extractor.

it goes.

for it to be fully dry.
- Abby: Correct.

00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,134
that goes inside of
our comforters

459
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,836
and our mattress toppers.

460
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,071
So he pulls the bat off,

461
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,474
and it comes off
in one large piece.

462
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,176
- Not as easy as it looks.

463
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,410
[Laughter]

464
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,612
- John: I'm not
getting through any of it!

465
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,614
There are women
doing something upstairs.

466
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,917
- Abby: So we put on
a layer of organic fabric.

467
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,985
We pin it
all the way around.

468
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,788
And then, they're going to
put wool on the top,

469
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,224
and then, they'll put
another layer of fabric,

470
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,426
and then, they'll start
to tie it.

471
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,894
- John: It's amazing

472
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,963
because it's all hands-on
for everything.

473
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,865
- Abby: And they tie
about every nine inches.

474
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:47,234
So, they go two times going
one way

475
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:50,237
and two times going the other
so that it doesn't come untied.

476
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,239
And then it would go over
to Ms. Christie,

477
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,041
and she sews the edges.

478
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,843
- John: Do you know that machine
pretty well?

479
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,045
- Christie: This is my machine.
- John: Is it yours?

480
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,313
- Christie: I love it.

481
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,914
- John: Now, that's going to
make television,

482
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:03,116
just so you know.
That's so good!

483
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,018
- Abby: So, we finish them up
here,

484
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,921
and we package them
for sale.

485
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,423
- John: Ha ha!

486
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,458
- Abby: There's very few
businesses that have been doing

487
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,961
the same thing since 1894.

488
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,495
- Like you're doing a pillow...

489
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,697
- Abby: And we're
American-made...

490
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,865
- John: And you're
American-made.

491
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,066
- Abby: Top to bottom.
[laughter]

492
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,202
We can control
every piece of the process.

493
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,972
- John: It's got to be the best.
I mean, doesn't it?

494
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,041
- Abby: Are you seeing
the control freak in me? Ha ha!

495
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,776
[cheerful music]

496
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,046
- Abby: There is so much
to do in Frankenmuth inside

497
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,848
that I was ready
for a little fresh air.

498
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,717
I've never, ever
done a ropes course,

499
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,885
but kids do this, right?

500
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,486
You can start doing this
at age seven?

501
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,821
- Seven, yeah.

502
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,689
- Emmy: I can't be scared
because seven-year-olds do it.

503
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,725
- So, these are
your safety clips, and so...

504
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,159
- Emmy: Come with me.

505
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,061
? ?

506
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,697
Oh, my gosh.
I'm a little more scared

507
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:52,165
than I really thought
I would be.

508
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,368
This is crazy!
Ooh. Oh!

509
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:58,105
You guys just flew through here.

510
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,440
Yes! OK, that was fun.

511
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,042
Whoo!

512
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,311
Oh, I can't believe John's
missing this.

513
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:05,712
Last one.

514
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,581
[pulley buzzes]

515
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,916
Whoo!

516
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,651
I love it!

517
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,354
Frankenmuth Aerial Park.
Don't miss it.

518
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,724
- John: This covered bridge
looks like it

519
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,826
could have been built
in 1879.

520
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,229
It was completed
in 1979.

521
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,998
They wanted to make
a modern bridge

522
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:27,401
but use Old World
building techniques.

523
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,471
So they had oxen pulling
all of the pieces

524
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,773
to put into place.

525
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,243
OK, that's going a little
too far, right, I think.

526
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,978
<i>Holz Brücke.</i>

527
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,549
What I think is great about
this museum is that we're

528
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:46,386
not looking at the tools of war,
the weapons of war.

529
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,589
- Emmy: Mm-hmm.
This is a museum
about the people.

530
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,724
This is
the Michigan Heroes Museum.

531
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,527
And it's all about heroes
of war and space.

532
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,896
A gentleman named Stan Bozich,

533
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,998
when he was younger, him
and his brothers would collect

534
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,933
all these military artifacts.

535
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,902
They would find them,
and then, the next day,

536
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,837
they'd go and play war
with them.

537
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,206
And they said
even back then,

538
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,208
they would someday
start a museum.

539
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,277
And in 1976, Stan did.

540
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,780
- John: And do you have any idea
how many stories they have?

541
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,350
- Emmy: There's over 900
rotating displays

542
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,820
but about 170 at any given time.
- John: Any given time.

543
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,488
Take a look.
Here's a silver frame...

544
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:22,823
- Emmy: Mm-hmm.
- John: portrait...

545
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,991
and a gold frame portrait.

546
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,759
Those in the gold frame
perished,

547
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,928
and they sacrificed
their lives.

548
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,731
- Emmy: If it's a silver frame,
they lived through the war.

549
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,433
What a really respectful way
to distinguish

550
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,836
between the two stories.
- John: Yes.

551
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,105
What's in these cabinets
belonged to these people

552
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,439
we're honoring.
- Emmy: Right.

553
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,175
- John: So that is his uniform.

554
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,845
These are his 13 Medals of Honor
and the books that he read.

555
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,947
And what's really great--
take a look.

556
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:50,184
He came to see how he'd been
honored in this display.

557
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,985
- Emmy: Let me tell you
about Christina Koch.

558
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,221
Eleven months
she spent in space.

559
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,523
That is the longest amount
of time for a woman,

560
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,493
the second longest amount
of time for an American.

561
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,562
And she made history.

562
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,897
- John: I mean,
we could meet her.

563
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:05,165
I mean, this is
a contemporary...

564
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,567
- Emmy: Exactly.
- John: who's living

565
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,368
at the same time we are
- Emmy: Right.

566
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,170
John, this is
Duane Hackney's story.

567
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:14,374
He was the youngest Air Force
Cross award winner,

568
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,779
and he did more than 200
rescue missions in Vietnam.

569
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,315
Eleven times,
he was actually left there

570
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:24,484
because the airplane left
to go to safety,

571
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,019
and he had to just find cover.

572
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,021
And he lived through
all of that.

573
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,023
- John: Made his way home.
- Emmy: Isn't that amazing?

574
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,191
- John: Yeah.

575
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:32,826
- Emmy: Just extraordinary
stories.

576
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,962
- John: And really important
to tell these stories.

577
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,296
- Emmy: These stories live on.

578
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,265
- John: We need our
Wisconsin museum, don't we?

579
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:40,667
Let's talk to John and see
if he can come to Wisconsin

580
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,403
and tell him
to set that up...

581
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:48,075
There's still strong ties
to the old country.

582
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,012
Can you guess what percentage
of the population of Frankenmuth

583
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,281
are ethnically German?

584
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,149
[quizzical music]

585
00:21:56,683 --> 00:22:01,054
- Emmy: 49% of Frankenmuth's
population is of German descent,

586
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,423
and I hope
that explains the outfit.

587
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,959
I just like to fit right in.

588
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,397
- John: We're at
the iconic Bavarian Inn.

589
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,032
Your family has something
to do with this.

590
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,101
- Amy Grossi: Yes, well,
my family owns and operates

591
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,402
Bavarian Inn.
- John: They do.

592
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,004
- Amy: So, I am
the fourth generation...

593
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,805
- John: You are.
- Amy:...in our family business.

594
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,607
- John: So you've been prepared
to do this?

595
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,409
- Amy: I think so.
- John: Ha ha!

596
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,611
And if the place had every seat
filled, how many people

597
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,414
would be sitting there?
- Amy: 1,200 people.

598
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,616
- John: 1,200?
- Amy: At one time, yes.

599
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,418
- John: The glockenspiel,
when did that show up?

600
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,188
- Amy: Yeah,
it showed up in 1967.

601
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:35,756
My grandparents
had been in Munich

602
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,157
and saw the glockenspiel there
and said,

603
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:38,458
"We need one in Frankenmuth."

604
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,260
- John: Like, it's really
remarkable that that's here.

605
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,629
- Amy: Yeah, it's kind of
a Frankenmuth landmark.

606
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,797
- John: Yeah.

607
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,599
- Amy: So now,
we're in our lower level.

608
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,867
- John: Right.
- Amy: Shops.

609
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,068
This is the gift shop--

610
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,403
homemade candy
and fudge over here.

611
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,671
- John: Oh, nice.

612
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,240
- Amy: Lots of souvenir items...
- John: Sure.

613
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,441
- Amy: German items.

614
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,543
- John: The Irish guy
in a German hat.

615
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,912
- Amy: Our doll and toy shop.

616
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,681
- John: The only baby
I'll ever have.

617
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,583
Sweet baby.

618
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,052
Yeah, this is
a good-looking strudel. - Amy:
Yes.

619
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,054
- John: Oh, I love the one
with powdered sugar.

620
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,856
- Amy: Mm-hmm. So we have
some German wines here.

621
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:10,357
We have Michigan wines.
- John: Private label.

622
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:11,558
- Amy: Yes.
- John: Yours?

623
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,759
- Amy: Yes.
- John: Yeah.

624
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,761
- Amy: Yeah. So we're
in the kitchen right now,

625
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,563
and you can see
Megan here is preparing

626
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,498
her meal to take out.

627
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,133
They'll get all their things
there

628
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,602
and head out
to the dining room.

629
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:22,870
We have what we call

630
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,538
the ultimate Bavarian
family-style meals.

631
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,173
- John: And meat-centric.
- Amy: Yes.

632
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,842
- John: Yeah, which is fine.
- Amy: Yes, we're German. Ha ha!

633
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,677
- John: No doubt.

634
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,480
- Our family-style chicken,
seasonal vegetables,

635
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,349
butter noodles and dressing,

636
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,885
mashed potatoes, gravy.

637
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,687
And we've got
our schnitzel, bratwurst,

638
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,155
rippchen, and sauerbraten.

639
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,191
- John: Where should we start?

640
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,226
- Amy: My grandmother
helped develop this menu,

641
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,695
and so a lot of the recipes
that we have are

642
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:52,533
our German ancestors',
their recipes.

643
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,334
And you have to have
some chicken.

644
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,603
We're most famous for
Frankenmuth-style chicken.

645
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,771
- John: I feel German.

646
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,072
I just do.

647
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,575
You've been doing it well
for four generations, yes?

648
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:05,012
- Amy: Yeah, well, I hope so.
- John: You have, yeah.

649
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,214
- Amy: It's a fun business
to be a part of.

650
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:10,083
Our purpose is
creating enjoyable experiences

651
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,885
both for our guests
and for our team members.

652
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,554
So, if you don't have happy
team members,

653
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,023
you don't have happy guests.
- John: It's a lot.

654
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,725
But don't worry.
I'll get to it.

655
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,929
? ?

656
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:24,565
Emmy, you've got to be familiar
with the word we hear a lot

657
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,567
in our hometown
of Milwaukee: "Gemütlichkeit."

658
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,168
- Emmy: Oh, sure!
I've heard that word.

659
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,170
Like, cozy...
- John: Yeah, cozy.
- Emmy: And warm.

660
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:31,572
- John: Warm.
- Emmy: Good cheer.

661
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,973
- John: Yeah, it certainly
describes Frankenmuth,

662
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,741
doesn't it?
- Emmy: Oh, to a T.

663
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,110
Now we just have to get you
some Lederhosen.

664
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,645
- John: Oh, I have some.

665
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:41,648
- ? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

666
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:44,251
? The heart and soul
of community's ?

667
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,886
? Right here... ?

668
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,889
- John: Pretzels the side of--
size of a-- [gibberish]

669
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:51,124
Something's going wrong.

670
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,527
Where do we-- where do we?
- Emmy: Where do we go?

671
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:54,695
[laughter]

672
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,930
- Emmy: ? Auf wiedersehen,
good night ?

673
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,099
- John: Were you done?
- Emmy: Um, yeah.

674
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,400
- John: Ha ha!
Were you?

675
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:03,937
[John claps]
- Perfect, great.
- Wow.

676

that to make great bakery,

684
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,494
you have to do it the right way.

is beautiful on the outside,

687
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:40,841
but it's what's inside
that counts.

688
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:45,412

like Oconomowoc.
