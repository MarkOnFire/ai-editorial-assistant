1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,109
We exist
to promote black culture.

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,210
Rollerskating.

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,880
We exist to teach it to people

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,282
that don't know about it.

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,588
Skaters have been skating
since way

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,625
before
the civil Rights movement.

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,227
And it's a style

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,264
that that nobody else gave us.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,799
It's the style we created.

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,140
A lot of our skaters at
Roll Train are not black.

11
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:45,379
But they see and they feel
what skating does for them.
