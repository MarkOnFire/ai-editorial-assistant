- Norman Gilliland: Welcome
to <i>University Place Presents.</i>

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,981
I'm Norman Gilliland.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,251
The paintings are beautiful:
<i>Valley Forge,</i>

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,187
<i>The Battle of Bunker Hill,</i>
<i>Braddock's Defeat,</i>

6
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,789
and many other images
from the American Revolution.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,225
But what was actually going on

8
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:29,463
that led up to those formative
moments in American history?

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,200
How did Americans learn to fight
and win a war

10
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:37,070
against the greatest power
in the world at the time?

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,672
With me is John Hall,

12
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,009
Professor of History at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,810
- Hi, Norman,
great to be with you today.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,846
- Welcome
to <i>University Place Presents.</i>

15
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,581
- Thanks.

16
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,484
- It's an image that we see,

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,221
these squared-off troops
fighting each other

18
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,423
in what today looks suicidal.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,927
Out in the open,
taking turns to load,

20
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,129
taking turns
to shoot at each other.

21
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:06,333
And something happened,
though, in America

22
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,604
that got Americans away
from that kind of fighting.

23
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,740
But we also have this image
of everybody hiding behind rocks

24
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,643
and shooting at these
red-coated British soldiers

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,378
out in the open.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,582
How did Americans start out?

27
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:26,119
- Well, it's complicated, right,
as with just about anything.

28
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,721
They brought over--

29
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,857
So, European colonists
to North America

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,758
brought over, of course,
systems of knowledge

31
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,629
about military art and science
that proved very tenacious.

32
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,431
And for quite a long time,

33
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,800
they continued to adhere
to those models,

34
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,970
in large part
because their economies

35
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,105
were relatively simple
and shallow.

36
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,141
Their foremost profession
was not to be soldiers.

37
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,977
And so they couldn't
really develop

38
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,945
any particular expertise.

39
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:55,148
And so the early colonists
actually brought over with them

40
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,584
professional soldiers
like Myles Standish,

41
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,052
who actually knew the business,

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,590
so that they could train people
in rudimentary military skills.

43
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,425
But they were still using

44
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,962
very much European tactics
at the time.

45
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,431
And these
were not terribly well-suited

46
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,500
to North American conditions.

47
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,504
So gradually,
as these populations grew

48
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,141
and allowed for a little bit
of economic specialization,

49
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,712
they developed the first
proto-professional formations

50
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:29,683
in North American history
from European ranks,

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,953
and we typically refer to these
formations as Rangers.

52
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,621
And what the Rangers would do

53
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,292
is essentially mimic
Indian doctrine and tactics,

54
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,462
and that was
to conduct very long-range raids

55
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,066
and try to strike fear
into their enemies,

56
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,203
a psychologically devastating
brand of warfare.

57
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,939
Strategically,
it wasn't terribly effectual.

58
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,274
But those, I think,
were kind of the first seeds

59
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,078
of a cross-cultural
transformation and exchange

60
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:02,683
of military practices that
produced a hybridization

61
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,551
of forms of warfare
in North America.

62
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,587
But that's in the early going.

63
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,791
It becomes even more complex as
we move into the 18th Century.

64
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,926
- We call it here
the French and Indian War.

65
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,963
It was actually just
the North American front

66
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,464
of the Seven Years' War,

67
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:22,169
which had been a major force
in Europe, continental Europe.

68
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,205
But was formative, wasn't it,

69
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,242
in the development
of North American

70
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,744
or even American
fighting tactics?

71
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:34,147
- Yeah, that's absolutely true,
although not, I think,

72
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,251
in the way that generations
of American school children

73
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,652
might have learned about this,

74
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,420
and familiarity
with this image here,

75
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,423
this famous image of Major
General Edward Braddock dying

76
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,461
while George Washington,
his aide for this expedition

77
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,664
and the de facto commander of
Virginia's Provincial Regiment,

78
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,199
looks on.

79
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:55,202
By the American
mythological telling of this,

80
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,138
this was the foolish British
bringing their outdated,

81
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,774
ill-suited tactics
to North America,

82
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,709
getting slaughtered wholesale

83
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,112
by French
and Native American forces,

84
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,048
who really knew how to fight
in the North American woodlands.

85
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,083
And by the mythological telling
of this,

86
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,919
this is really formative
in the development

87
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,655
of George Washington's thinking
about war,

88
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,859
and he will forswear these kinds
of British tactics and so forth.

89
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,894
That's not exactly
what happens here.

90
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,931
In point of fact,
Washington will allege

91
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,967
that the problem with the
British force in this expedition

92
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:31,505
was that they were using
the wrong European formations,

93
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,507
that they were
in close-order formations

94
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,642
when they should have been
in more open-order formations,

95
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,110
and more to the point

96
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,580
that the enlisted men panicked,
that they were not disciplined.

97
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,848
Which is sort of ironic,

98
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,516
because the argument
that he's making, essentially,

99
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,484
is they weren't regular enough.

100
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,153
They weren't Europe--
They weren't fighting

101
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,288
like Redcoats
are supposed to fight.

102
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,058
He had nothing but fond things
to say

103
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,026
about all of the
British officers,

104
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,661
Braddock foremost among them.

105
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,263
Washington,
for the rest of his life,

106
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,031
looked upon
the deceased Braddock

107
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,700
as something of a role model.

108
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,934
And right after this fight,

109
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,003
one of the first things
that Washington did

110
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,073
is order 1740s vintage treatise

111
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,244
on traditional
military discipline and tactics

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,946
so he could train
his own Virginia provincials

113
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,682
to fight more like the British,

114
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,751
rather than less
like the British,

115
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,586
albeit hoping for better results

116
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,524
than Braddock met here
in July of 1755, of course.

117
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,727
That said,
the British learn a lot

118
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,763
from the Seven Years' War
in North America,

119
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,565
or the French and Indian War.

120
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,734
And by the end of that conflict,

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,270
they have developed
their own expertise

122
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,672
in North American
woodland fighting.

123
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,675
In point of fact, within
the British Army at this time,

124
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,511
there are two schools,
if you will.

125
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,381
There's the German school,
and there's the American school.

126
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,983
And it's all about
where they cut their teeth.

127
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,620
And they have very different
preferences about how to fight.

128
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,722
It's just another element
of American mythology,

129
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,591
is that the British learned
next to nothing

130
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,359
from this war in North America

131
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,829
and come back and try
the same thing again in 1775,

132
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,365
which is frankly not true.

133
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,268
- Well, when we say
the French and Indian War,

134
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,171
that is the French and Indians
on one side

135
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:15,242
and the Americans and British
on the other.

136
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,245
Well, how are the French, then,

137
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,849
mixing their tactics
with the Native Americans?

138
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,951
- So the French, I would argue,

139
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,887
become masters
of this North American,

140
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,723
hybridized form of warfare
earlier

141
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,360
and to a greater extent
than the British,

142
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,663
because they are
so much more reliant

143
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,299
upon their
Native American allies.

144
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,902
And so when we say
French and Indian on one side,

145
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,238
I think we should put the word
"Indian" in bold

146
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,475
and underline it and so forth,
because they, the French,

147
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:53,347
are genuinely dependent upon
their Native American allies

148
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,082
by virtue of geography.

149
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,751
There's not enough
arable land up there.

150
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,720
These are not
self-sufficient colonies.

151
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,321
So they remain very dependent

152
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:06,426
upon a fragile, seaborne tether
back to Europe for resupply.

153
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,630
They are not, despite French
efforts to make them so,

154
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,798
sustainable settler colonies,
right?

155
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:15,002
So this is an overwhelmingly
male enterprise.

156
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,637
And if you look at a map

157
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,473
of, you know,
French claims to North America,

158
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,243
all of Canada and all of the
original Louisiana Territory,

159
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,078
those are very bold claims

160
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,181
when you've got
these tiny, little garrisons,

161
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,584
penny packets of troops
strung out all across it.

162
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,086
And so the French
really have no recourse

163
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,088
but to make themselves

164
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,025
utterly dependent
upon their Native allies.

165
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:42,629
And so prior to the French
and Indian War in North America,

166
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,598
all of their tactics

167
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,401
were essentially
this hybridized form of warfare,

168
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,002
with Troupes de la Marine,

169
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,737
those are the French
colonial forces,

170
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,474
regular forces in North America,
their own militia forces.

171
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:59,847
All military-age males
in New France were obligatory,

172
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,682
obliged to be in the militia.

173
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,016
There is some symmetry there

174
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,551
with the British colonies
in North America

175
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,086
and these many,
many Native allies.

176
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,489
And they also did these
long-range raids and so forth.

177
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,292
A couple of things that make
the French and Indian War,

178
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,129
the Seven Years' War,
in North America different.

179
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,565
This is the fourth and final

180
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,902
of these great wars for empire
in North America,

181
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,070
but it's the first one

182
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,205
that actually begins
in North America.

183
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,875
It's the first one
that sees on both sides

184
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,110
the massive importation

185
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,380
of professional regular forces
from Europe,

186
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:37,217
because this is the original and
main theater for this conflict,

187
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,720
albeit it does become
a world war,

188
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,290
a genuinely world war
fought on several continents.

189
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:47,060
Winston Churchill referred
to this as the First World War.

190
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,962
That's another way
in which it is unique.

191
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,798
But the ultimate one is it's
the only one that's decisive.

192
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,002
It does result
in the vanquishing of the French

193
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,637
from North America.

194
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,672
And some would argue
it is because

195
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,075
with the importation of these
professional formations,

196
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,979
professional regiments
and royal officers from Europe,

197
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,516
that the French lose their way,
so to speak.

198
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,518
That's something
that you might debate.

199
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,320
I don't know
that a different strategy

200
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,490
would have served their ends
by this point in time.

201
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:20,594
But it turns into a very,
very conventional,

202
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,863
European-style fight

203
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,966
in which Native Americans
are now auxiliaries,

204
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,935
as are the militia forces
auxiliaries,

205
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,103
to main force actions.

206
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,939
And in Europe,
they would refer,

207
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,775
in France in particular,
they refer to this distinction

208
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:37,444
as "grand guerre"
and "petite guerre,"

209
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,446
you know, "big" and "small war."

210
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,182
And what's necessary
to understand about this

211
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,485
is they are related
to one another.

212
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,021
Obviously, they have,

213
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,091
they work in symbiotic fashion
with one another, okay?

214
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,127
So the petite guerre,
the war on the fringes,

215
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,497
is the place where Rangers
and Native American warriors

216
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,933
and all of these other
American,

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,905
uniquely North American elements
of warfare in the 18th century

218
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,374
are still very, very vital.

219
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,011
But they are harnessed
to main efforts

220
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,047
that are using conventional
European doctrines and tactics

221
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,885
modified to suit the broken
terrain, the wooded terrain,

222
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,520
unique conditions
of a North American

223
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,754
theater of operations.

224
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,823
- What tribes were involved?

225
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,461
- That is an impossible question
to answer tidily

226
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,265
because of the scale
of this conflict.

227
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:36,103
You're dealing with,
in one fashion or another,

228
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,507
there's virtually no Native
nation east of the Mississippi

229
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:44,478
who is not somehow
engaged in this conflict,

230
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:48,315
some of them far more
substantially than others.

231
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,618
All of the tribes
from the Ohio country,

232
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:55,556
that is the original
and main seat of this war.

233
00:10:55,622 --> 00:11:00,460
The Iroquois Confederacy
had pledged neutrality

234
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:05,232
in all wars between France
and Britain in 1701,

235
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,870
and otherwise remaining a
steadfast ally of Great Britain.

236
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,573
And it's not until
the closing stanzas

237
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,841
of the French and Indian War

238
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,642
that they can see
the writing on the wall,

239
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,111
that France is headed
for a bad end,

240
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,947
and that they probably need

241
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,416
to tidy up their alliance
with Great Britain.

242
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,752
And so the Iroquois alliance,
the Haudenosaunee,

243
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:30,724
will forgo neutrality
and, at the end, actually side

244
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,962
with their longstanding
traditional allies, the British.

245
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,964
- We'll, from time to time,
get into some

246
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,433
of the actual people
and personalities

247
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:44,338
involved in this evolution
of American tactics.

248
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,039
And one of them
is Robert Rogers,

249
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:51,578
who has been, oh, written about
both in fiction and nonfiction.

250
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:56,283
I'm remembering Kenneth Roberts'
novel from 1937,

251
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,485
<i>Northwest Passage,</i>
which has a lot to do

252
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,721
with Robert Rogers
and Rogers' Rangers.

253
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,323
And I wouldn't say romanticized,

254
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,160
but probably different
from what literally happened

255
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,596
with Robert Rogers.
- John: Oh, quite right.

256
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,332
I remember reading
<i>Northwest Passage</i>

257
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,067
in my own youth,

258
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:17,404
and, you know, relishing
this kind of heroic,

259
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,508
frontier, hero image
of Robert Rogers.

260
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,710
He is often regarded
as the paragon

261
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,513
of this American Ranger
tradition.

262
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,318
And there's two people
we might thank for that fact:

263
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:34,521
Robert Rogers
and Francis Parkman.

264
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,557
So--
- Norman: Much later writer.

265
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,925
- John: Much later writer.

266
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,094
But Robert Rogers was also
a very skilled self-promoter.

267
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,063
And Francis Parkman,

268
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,801
in his magisterial,
but deeply flawed histories,

269
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:53,874
elevated Rogers to this, you
know, heroic sort of stature.

270
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,411
The truth is, the British
got kind of tired

271
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,513
of Robert Rogers
and his Rangers,

272
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,783
their indiscipline,
the cost of sustaining them.

273
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,652
And eventually,
what they're gonna try to do

274
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,554
between the French
and Indian War

275
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,323
and the American Revolution

276
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,027
is to get rid of or wean
themselves from a reliance

277
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:18,232
on these provincial sorts
of Ranger outfits

278
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,469
and to train actual
British regulars

279
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,640
to be skilled in North American
woodland fighting.

280
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:30,210
There's a prototype regiment,
the 80th Regiment of Foot,

281
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,979
which is the test case for this.

282
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,780
It's disappointing
in many regards.

283
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,016
It doesn't really live up
to full expectations.

284
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,385
But the important point
is coming out

285
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:40,988
of the French and Indian War
in North America,

286
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,724
the British Army recognizes

287
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:48,161
that it needs to modify
its doctrine and its tactics

288
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,030
to fight in these conditions.

289
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,698
And a general trend,

290
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,901
not just in the British Army,
not just in North America,

291
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,104
but across all of Europe
at this time,

292
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,641
is to regularize
or professionalize

293
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,045
the organizations
for waging petite guerre.

294
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:09,149
So at the very beginning,
earlier in the 18th century,

295
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:13,153
many of these armies
relied on irregular forces,

296
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,026
provincial forces to perform
this kind of light operations

297
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,695
on the fringes
of the main battlefields.

298
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,897
But they are
not always disciplined,

299
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,900
they are not always reliable,
and as a consequence,

300
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,870
they all drift generally
in the same direction.

301
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,906
And that is to train
professional soldiers

302
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,043
to be able to perform
those same functions

303
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,178
with greater reliability.

304
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,314
And that's the direction
that the British go,

305
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,548
and it's the direction

306
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,217
that the Americans
are gonna go as well,

307
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,385
once they declare
their own independence.

308
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,221
- Speaking of which,

309
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,991
when we get to 1775,
before independence

310
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:55,662
has officially been claimed
by the Americans,

311
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,298
we already have a fighting war.

312
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:02,436
And most famously, I suppose,
Bunker Hill,

313
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,505
Battle of Bunker Hill,

314
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:10,043
which we think of as a heroic
moment for American soldiers.

315
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,014
And yet it was
a British victory.

316
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,182
What happened there?

317
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,251
- John: Well,
it's a British victory.

318
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,186
You might call it
a Pyrrhic victory, though,

319
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,455
given the losses
that they sustained

320
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,258
in order to actually take
Breed's Hill

321
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,826
and then subsequently
Bunker Hill,

322
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:29,096
but we call the engagement
the Battle of Bunker Hill.

323
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,298
Again, in American lore,

324
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,867
this is one of a trifecta
of monuments

325
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,103
to British martial stupidity,
right,

326
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,238
the first being
Braddock's defeat,

327
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,439
this being the second,

328
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,875
and the third being
Andrew Jackson's victory

329
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,544
at the Battle of New Orleans,
right?

330
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,612
In the American imaginary,

331
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,715
all three of these are evidence
that the British don't know

332
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,251
how to fight
in North American conditions,

333
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,755
and probably also something
about the corrupting influence

334
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:59,493
of having an officer corps
commanded by nobility,

335
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,263
while common men are left
to do the fighting.

336
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,265
So in American mythology,

337
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,302
not only do Americans know
better than to fight this way,

338
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,604
but, also, the free spirit,

339
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:13,307
the independent character
of your average American citizen

340
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:18,178
would never be so yoked
to some unnatural authority

341
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,015
that they would follow
these kinds of suicidal orders.

342
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,450
We can take all of that

343
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,454
with a very,
very healthy grain of salt.

344
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,690
The image, right,
that we have here

345
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:33,160
of <i>The Battle of Bunker Hill</i>
is an iconic one.

346
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,195
It's a, you know,
it's a striking image.

347
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,965
It's also
quite historically inaccurate.

348
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,568
I am now going to actually
defend Lord Howe's tactics,

349
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,437
rather,
at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

350
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,572
This is relatively early
in the war,

351
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,907
before
the Declaration of Independence.

352
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,642
This is in 1775.

353
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,844
And there is
a deliberate desire here

354
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,447
to wage psychological warfare
on the colonists,

355
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,650
to overawe them, shock and awe,
if you will,

356
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:01,054
to demonstrate exactly what
fight they are picking, okay?

357
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,023
And it really is incredible.

358
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,058
- Norman: With the most powerful
empire in the world.

359
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,660
- The most powerful empire
in the world.

360
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,562
That's absolutely true.

361
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,998
I will there issue one caveat.

362
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,633
This is another part
of American mythology.

363
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,102
It's often said, "the most
powerful army in the world."

364
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,570
That's not true, okay?

365
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,805
They are not facing
the most powerful

366
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,376
or by reputation
the best army in the world.

367
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:26,079
Britain's empire, of course,
is foremost a maritime empire.

368
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,283
I mean, and that is
the foundation of its stature

369
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,285
as the greatest empire
in the world.

370
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,854
Another fun fact,
ironically enough,

371
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,589
that power waxes

372
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,193
after Britain loses the war
for American independence.

373
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,795
So strategically speaking,
you could say

374
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,463
that the independence
of the American colonies

375
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,932
is good for Great Britain,

376
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:49,670
because its star continues
to rise after this war.

377
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:54,141
Nevertheless,
this is a formidable force.

378
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,312
These are highly disciplined,
highly trained, regular forces.

379
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:02,216
And this is intended
to demonstrate to the Americans

380
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,619
that you've taken on
quite the lion.

381
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,923
But the Americans have
the advantage at Bunker Hill

382
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,093
in fighting from
prepared defensive positions.

383
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,630
And you are also facing
New England troops

384
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:17,865
at this point in time,

385
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:22,269
still militia troops
not yet fully organized

386
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:24,538
into what will become
the Continental Army.

387
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,741
But it's worth remembering that
these colonies in North America,

388
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:31,478
those in New England,
are those that were most engaged

389
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,647
in the French and Indian War.

390
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:34,915
And as a consequence,

391
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:38,752
a lot of these militia forces
are actually veteran,

392
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,389
composed of veteran
combat soldiers.

393
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,259
Many of the Redcoats, meanwhile,
that are storming the hill,

394
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,694
this is the first combat,
and for many of them, sadly,

395
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:51,431
the last combat
that they will ever see.

396
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,735
The Americans take away
from Bunker Hill

397
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,970
dangerous lessons, though.

398
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:59,706
I mean, it sort of reinforces

399
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,543
their own proto-national
mythology

400
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,112
about themselves being,
you know, uniquely gifted

401
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,181
in the arts
of woodland fighting

402
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,682
and the British automatons,

403
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,851
they're gonna foolishly do
these kinds of things.

404
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,653
And so the Americans
coming away from Bunker Hill

405
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,454
are gonna think
that all they have to do

406
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,190
to win independence
is to reprise these,

407
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,992
you know, this scenario
over and over and over again.

408
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,794
- Does that mean
just take the high ground?

409
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:21,962
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

410
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,031
Wherever you go,
pick the high ground, dig in,

411
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,700
and wait for the British
to foolishly attack.

412
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,903
This is really the last place
it's gonna happen like that

413
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,307
until you get to the next war,
and at the very end of it,

414
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,742
with the Battle of New Orleans.

415
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,644
The very next time
that the Americans

416
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,080
try to repeat this method

417
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:44,017
is just the following year
in the Battle of Long Island.

418
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,153
And they're dug in,
and they wait for the British.

419
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,288
And the British
fix them in place

420
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,390
and then easily go around them

421
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,125
and completely rout
the Americans.

422
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,695
And it turns into
a very near-run disaster,

423
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,496
in fact, for the Americans.

424
00:19:56,563 --> 00:20:02,469
The entire campaign season of
1776 is an unmitigated disaster.

425
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:08,075
I often say the expression
"the spirit of '76"

426
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,278
ought to be amended
to "the spirit of '75,"

427
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,247
because it's in 1775

428
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,651
that the nation
is aroused and patriotic

429
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,955
and filled with what one scholar
has called "rage militaire"

430
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:25,058
and just really ready to take
the fight to the British.

431
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,793
The spirit of 1776

432
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,698
is verily "the times
that try men's souls,"

433
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,234
of which Thomas Paine wrote,

434
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:38,238
because of one military reverse
after another

435
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:41,074
that the Americans encounter
that year.

436
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:44,478
And what George Washington
learns,

437
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,448
and I say "learned"
with some hesitation there,

438
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,884
because I should say
it's a conviction

439
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,520
that is reinforced
in that season,

440
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,490
is that American militia forces

441
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,393
are no match
for British regulars.

442
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,961
- Not well-enough trained.

443
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,329
- They're not
well-enough trained.

444
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,631
They're not
well-enough disciplined.

445
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,901
This is another element
about George Washington

446
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:12,005
that is underappreciated
in American history.

447
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,141
He recognizes
the raw material

448
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,376
with which he has to work,

449
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:20,480
and he is not going to impose
upon his own forces

450
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:23,350
the same degree of discipline

451
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:27,020
to which the British forces
are subjected.

452
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:31,491
But it is a difference
only of degree and kind.

453
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,660
He is an advocate
of corporal punishment.

454
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,095
He is an advocate of floggings.

455
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:37,698
He is an advocate of executions.

456
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,602
Under his orders, those methods
of discipline are dispensed.

457
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,403
And that's one of the things
about the militias.

458
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,007
They will not tolerate
that kind of discipline.

459
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,276
And he needs forces
that are reliable enough

460
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,812
that they are subjectable

461
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,348
to that kind
of military discipline.

462
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,651
So you mentioned at the open,
you know, these linear tactics,

463
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:00,053
they look suicidal to us.

464
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,289
And in many respects they are.

465
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:07,294
But they are also fit to the
technology of the time, right?

466
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:12,232
So it's worth remembering
that Napoleonic tactics,

467
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,867
Napoleon ushers in

468
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:18,505
what is genuinely
a revolutionary era in warfare.

469
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,642
It is a bona fide revolution
in military affairs.

470
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,943
And nevertheless,

471
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,747
even Napoleon's revolutionary
methods for waging war

472
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,283
to an amateur eye
look really similar

473
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,552
to what you're seeing here
at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

474
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,821
And that is a reflection
largely of technology,

475
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,657
but also geography

476
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,792
and the battle spaces
in which they were fighting.

477
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,495
And so over the course
of the American Revolution,

478
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:44,064
the Americans are gonna get
better and better

479
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,300
at fighting like the British,

480
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,803
in linear formations
and on open fields,

481
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,705
when they need to do that.

482
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,140
But, again,
it's still hybridized.

483
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:54,374
On the fringes of that,

484
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,276
they're still using
these light infantry tactics.

485
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:58,312
But so, too, are the British.

486
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,415
- The Americans
have this romantic reputation

487
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,750
for their long rifles
and long range

488
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,520
that goes with the rifles
and sniping.

489
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:08,255
How accurate is that?

490
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:11,592
- John: It is accurate
to an extent,

491
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,961
because of the
North American conditions.

492
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,429
And on the frontiers,

493
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,264
whether you're talking about
Native Americans

494
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:20,033
or frontier people
of European descent,

495
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,102
a rifle is a vital tool

496
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,274
for defense
as well as for hunting, right?

497
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,576
And so there are populations
in the continent

498
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:31,612
that become very, very skilled

499
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:34,548
in the use of aimed,
long-range fire,

500
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:37,784
which is made possible
by a rifle.

501
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,921
And because the Americans
had convinced themselves

502
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:42,523
that they were masters

503
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,393
of this kind of unique American
way of war,

504
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,861
presumed at the outset

505
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,763
that they would have
an advantage

506
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,434
when it came to rifle fire,
aimed long-range fire.

507
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:58,872
And Congress authorizes
the raising of a rifle corps

508
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,107
right from the outset.

509
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,408
As soon as they authorized

510
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:03,544
the organization
of the Continental Army,

511
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,479
they're gonna have riflemen
as well.

512
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,949
And New Englanders
such as John Adams, right,

513
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:10,551
they knew the hype.

514
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,486
They wanted,
they're hungry for this.

515
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:14,421
They believe
that if we can get

516
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:18,358
some Pennsylvania backcountry
riflemen in here,

517
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:21,695
that's gonna give us
a decisive edge in this fight.

518
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:25,966
And the early returns
are a little bit disappointing.

519
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:31,305
The problem is the rifle is a
very specialized kind of weapon,

520
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:37,244
and it really is not that useful
in general purposes, right?

521
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,213
So in a regular fight

522
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,516
in which you need to be able
to reload quickly

523
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,652
or react to flanking movements

524
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,589
or potentially conduct
a retrograde

525
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,258
and stop and reform
firing lines,

526
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,260
the rifle is no good
at any of these things.

527
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,162
It takes way too long
to reload it,

528
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:57,531
because they haven't yet
developed the technology,

529
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,533
what will be known
as the Minié ball.

530
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,401
So they have a solid ball

531
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:05,172
that they need to ram down
a rifle barrel.

532
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,241
And every time
they fire that rifle,

533
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,309
powder fouls the barrel,

534
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,245
and the diameter
of the barrel constricts.

535
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:14,715
So every subsequent shot
becomes harder and harder

536
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,117
to ram down
the barrel of the gun.

537
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,819
Whereas
with a smoothbore musket,

538
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:21,188
there's a little bit of play
in there.

539
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:26,827
And exceptionally, exceptionally
well-drilled soldiers

540
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,497
with smoothbore muskets
in this era

541
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:34,301
could get off as many
as six rounds in a minute.

542
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,603
Now, that is an extreme--
- That's fast.

543
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,840
- And the expectations for
most professionals is half that,

544
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,742
more like three.

545
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,844
But if you have a rifleman
on the field

546
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,079
and they get turned out
of their position,

547
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:48,081
they need to just run
and get out,

548
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:49,750
because it is impractical,

549
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,886
impracticable to think
that they might be able to stop

550
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,923
and load and be part
of the fight.

551
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:59,726
And so even the most
veteran riflemen and officers,

552
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,528
commanders of them
over the course of the war,

553
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:04,097
recognized
that they are next to useless

554
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:07,801
if they are not embedded
in larger formations

555
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:11,171
that have muskets,
smoothbore muskets with them

556
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:15,909
to provide that adaptability
and that sort of nest

557
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:22,182
to return to for safety
in the case of danger.

558
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,984
On the flip side of it,

559
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:26,520
their expectation
of an asymmetric advantage,

560
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:27,855
that is also a little misplaced

561
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,523
because as I've already
mentioned,

562
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,692
the British already learned
the value of riflemen

563
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,861
and light formations

564
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,896
over the course
of the Seven Years' War.

565
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:39,533
Every British battalion
that fights in North America

566
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,470
has a company of light infantry
that is armed with rifles.

567
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:47,007
In 1776, the British Army adopts
for the first time

568
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:51,445
a standard-issue rifle and ships
them off to North America.

569
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:54,281
And really,
by the midpoint of the war,

570
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:59,152
we see parity in terms
of British and American skill

571
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:02,089
in use of the rifle.

572
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:05,726
Interestingly,
the British asymmetric advantage

573
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:10,430
at the beginning of the war
is the use of the bayonet.

574
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:13,600
Same sort of process occurs,
and by the midpoint of the war,

575
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,503
the Americans
have also become skilled

576
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,405
in the use of the bayonet,

577
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:23,010
and so that that is no longer
an asymmetric advantage.

578
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,512
And so places like Bunker Hill,

579
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:29,082
where British forces are trying
to assault fixed positions,

580
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,652
what they want to do
is get across that death ground

581
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,388
as quickly as possible
and close with the enemy

582
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:37,024
and do their fighting
with cold steel.

583
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,059
That's also
psychological warfare,

584
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:41,128
but it also reflects the fact

585
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,163
that if you're engaged
in a firefight,

586
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,667
the people with breastworks
up to their chins

587
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,969
are at a distinct advantage
vis-à-vis

588
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,337
the people wearing red coats

589
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:51,972
standing in the wide open.
- Yes.

590
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,709
- So they don't want to stop
too many times and fire,

591
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,646
you know,
off ineffectual volleys of fire.

592
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,648
They'll do that,
but what they really want to do

593
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:04,751
is get into that trench
and use the bayonet.

594
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:07,120
And they will use that
effectively.

595
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,957
But as I said, the Americans
get skilled at that, as well.

596
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,759
The chief American proponent
of the bayonet

597
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:16,096
is General "Mad" Anthony Wayne,

598
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,132
who, in I think his most
famous exploit with the bayonet,

599
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,134
the Battle of Stony Point,

600
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,639
his forces advanced without
even loading their muskets.

601
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,375
Their firearms are unloaded

602
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,013
so as to prevent the temptation
of firing a shot

603
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,781
and giving away the surprise.

604
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,149
And they sneak in

605
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,318
and do all of their dirty work
with bayonets.

606
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,320
- I can see where
he'd get that name, then,

607
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,622
Mad Anthony Wayne.
- Yes.

608
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:44,157
- "You want me to run up there
with an unloaded rifle?"

609
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,659
- John: Right, yes.
- Yeah.

610
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:48,529
And the very uncertain return

611
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,634
for that kind of fighting.
- John: Yeah.

612
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,638
- When I read a little bit
about these tactics

613
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:02,376
and the, let's say,
international participation

614
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,746
in the American Revolution,
I'm tempted to say, well,

615
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:09,316
it's the Prussians
versus the Hessians, really.

616
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:12,219
- To some extent,
although you might say

617
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,154
it's still the Prussians
against the Prussians,

618
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:18,192
because of the six German states
that send soldiers,

619
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,561
and note
I did not say mercenaries.

620
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:22,763
They sent soldiers
to North America.

621
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,166
Five of those states built their
militaries on Prussian models.

622
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,035
So they're using
Prussian tactics

623
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,037
and Prussian formations.

624
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:34,308
The sixth of those German states
is built on an Austrian model.

625
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:37,744
But the Prussian influence on
the American profession of arms,

626
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,079
not just in the Revolution,

627
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:41,048
but to some extent
even afterward,

628
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:45,052
is exercised
by Baron Friedrich von Steuben.

629
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,555
Some contest whether the "von"
is actually warranted or not.

630
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,057
- Norman: The nobility
questionable.

631
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,658
- Yeah,
I'll side in with the faction

632
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:55,662
that says that, you know,
"We'll give it to him."

633
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,231
But von Steuben becomes

634
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,933
Washington's drillmaster,
famously,

635
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,935
at the winter encampment
at Valley Forge.

636
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:05,239
This is the winter of 1777
and 1778.

637
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:09,042
If the campaign season of '76

638
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:12,112
was the times
that try men's souls,

639
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,414
'77 was much, much better.

640
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,718
You had a great victory
at the Battle of Saratoga,

641
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:22,656
which would, in '78, produce
an open alliance with France,

642
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:24,591
which is an essential ingredient

643
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:28,195
to eventual American victory
in this conflict.

644
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:32,165
And you also have,
I would say improvement

645
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:38,906
with Washington's army
in the vicinity of Philadelphia,

646
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,240
notwithstanding the fact

647
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,809
that Washington meets
a couple of reverses there,

648
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:46,180
and the Congress is driven
from its capital city.

649
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:49,883
As well, there is after that
the Battle of Germantown,

650
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,853
which I think we would
technically count as a draw,

651
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,289
but George Washington
and his officers

652
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,425
will chalk that up
as a considerable victory

653
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,427
against the main force
of the British Army,

654
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:03,630
especially given
how 1776 had gone.

655
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,033
And it is in the winter
after that

656
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,068
where they go into this
famous encampment

657
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:10,103
very near Philadelphia

658
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,841
that Washington will mold
his Continental Army,

659
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:17,044
which by now
has expanded in size.

660
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:20,047
The terms of enlistment has
been extended to three years.

661
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:23,183
So it's giving him
the raw materials that he needs

662
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,152
to build a real army.

663
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:30,657
And of these many, many
European émigrés who come over,

664
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,327
it's Friedrich von Steuben who
becomes the drillmaster there.

665
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,196
He's given the position
of Inspector General.

666
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:41,401
He is going to use a 1760s
vintage British drill manual,

667
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,372
because it is the most
widely used and available

668
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,941
in the North American colonies
at this time,

669
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:54,014
and his own Prussian experience
to produce a uniquely American,

670
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,819
but still derived very much
from European precedents,

671
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:02,122
manual of arms, right,
how to do the drill.

672
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:05,058
And he does this
by forming a model company,

673
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,362
and he will train
noncommissioned officers,

674
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,098
officers from across the
Continental Army,

675
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,266
in how to do this

676
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,268
so that then they can go back
to their units

677
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:17,371
and repeat and be repeated
over and over again,

678
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:22,643
and by this model, disseminate
this system of knowledge.

679
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,711
By the end of that encampment,

680
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:28,015
the Continental Army
will roll out,

681
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:31,618
freshly trained
in this new system of doctrine,

682
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:35,088
which is standardized at last
across the Continental Army,

683
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:38,792
and they will test it out at the
Battle of Guilford Courthouse,

684
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,062
which, again,
is technically a draw.

685
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,365
But it is the most glorious
of draws,

686
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,701
because the senior
British commander

687
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,469
is withdrawing his force
from Philadelphia

688
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,104
back to New York City,

689
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,339
and the Continental Army
attacks.

690
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:56,944
It attacks the main
British army on the march.

691
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,912
British Army pivots,
and it is,

692
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,914
there's desperate,
desperate fighting.

693
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:04,184
And the Continental Army shows
that it is the equal of,

694
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:08,422
the match of this
very, very well-trained

695
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,824
and well-disciplined
British army at the time

696
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:14,027
in conventional, linear combat.

697
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:17,231
- It has learned that much
that quickly.

698
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:20,634
- Yeah, but this is also
by the spring of '78, right,

699
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:22,903
they've learned a few things.

700
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,105
And you do still have
in this army

701
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,875
a number of veterans
of the French and Indian War.

702
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:30,944
So it's not as though
they were starting from scratch,

703
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,013
but they are more orderly
and disciplined now

704
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,182
in the way that they conduct
these operations.

705
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,284
- The American Revolution
has been called a civil war

706
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:39,152
with some justification.

707
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:42,022
What were the
Loyalists Americans

708
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,057
doing in the Revolutionary War?

709
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:47,628
- Well, it depends on
where they lived.

710
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,997
Many of them got out of Dodge,
right?

711
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,164
- Norman: Went to Canada.

712
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:53,600
- They went to Canada
right away.

713
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,136
And then, many of them
that go to Canada

714
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,071
end up fighting
their former countrymen again

715
00:33:58,138 --> 00:33:59,606
in the War of 1812,

716
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:03,210
which in that regard
is also more of a civil war

717
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:05,212
than many have appreciated,

718
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,781
although Alan Taylor
has sort of adjusted

719
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:09,183
the way that we think about it

720
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:12,586
with a book referring to that
as a civil war.

721
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:15,355
Others are
in Loyalist strongholds,

722
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:20,761
and they're able to live life
relatively comfortably.

723
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:23,797
I think that many
of the denizens of New York

724
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:26,733
would consider
the campaign season of 1776

725
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,137
a liberation
by the British forces.

726
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:34,708
Norfolk, Virginia,
is a hotbed of loyalism.

727
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,810
A lot of these
are coastal cities

728
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:39,580
that are very, very engaged

729
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:42,082
in Britain's mercantile empire,
right?

730
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,250
So this revolution

731
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:47,754
is a massive financial
inconvenience for them,

732
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:49,356
and they would rather
it not have happened,

733
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,726
and they would like it
to get over as soon as possible.

734
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:55,162
And in these hotbeds
of loyalism,

735
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:59,499
the British are able to raise
their own Loyalist forces.

736
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,636
And so some of these
are provincial forces

737
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,705
and others are militia forces.

738
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,908
And they run the gamut
in terms of quality,

739
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,810
and in this regard,
they sort of just mimic

740
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:14,481
exactly what the Continentals
are doing at the same time.

741
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:16,850
The most famous and infamous

742
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:19,486
of these sort of
American-raised units

743
00:35:19,553 --> 00:35:22,756
is Banastre Tarleton's
American Legion.

744
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:24,057
- Notorious.
- Yes.

745
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,359
And it's all because of the

746
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:28,362
so-called massacre
of the Waxhaws, right?

747
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,231
And so anybody familiar
with <i>The Patriot</i>

748
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:34,301
will be familiar
with the archvillain

749
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,703
of that Mel Gibson movie.

750
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:41,408
That's modeled loosely
on Banastre Tarleton.

751
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,410
And the Battle of the Waxhaws
is an instance

752
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:46,813
in which, you know,
an American force,

753
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,817
you know, was closed upon
very, very quickly.

754
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,653
And it's, you know,

755
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,489
one of the relatively rare
true cavalry actions

756
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:58,091
in the American
War for Independence.

757
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,961
And in the, during the attack,

758
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:05,199
soldiers are trying
to surrender,

759
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:09,236
but it is a very difficult thing
to try to surrender

760
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:13,340
at the moment of impact
in an assault like this.

761
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:16,043
And so historians
still kind of debate

762
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:18,045
whether this is actually
a massacre

763
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:22,616
or just the complete defeat
of an American force.

764
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:25,352
But Tarleton's Legion
is an example

765
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:29,223
of an American-raised
provincial force

766
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:35,095
which looks, behaves,
acts absolutely professionally.

767
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:38,098
There are other militia forces,
though,

768
00:36:38,165 --> 00:36:41,101
that are Loyalists
that are a little less effective

769
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:44,171
or considerably less effective
than that.

770
00:36:44,238 --> 00:36:46,607
The other, I'd say,
of the most famous

771
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:48,976
of the Loyalist
provincial forces

772
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,479
are those
under Patrick Ferguson,

773
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:56,917
which meet a bad end
at the Battle of Kings Mountain.

774
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,585
- We have a little bit of a,

775
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:00,187
I won't call it
a rogues' gallery here,

776
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:03,557
but a gallery of some
of the partisans,

777
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:07,194
as you call them,
who affected the war.

778
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:11,765
- John: Yeah, so this is the
other interesting thing

779
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:17,404
about the American way of war
as it develops in North America

780
00:37:18,505 --> 00:37:19,973
during the War for Independence.

781
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,143
I think the older assumption,
and much older history

782
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,413
certainly follow this story line
is, you know,

783
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,081
Washington learns
from Braddock's defeat,

784
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,816
becomes very fond

785
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:34,121
of frontier tactics
and things like that.

786
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:36,890
And hence, when he wages
the American,

787
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:38,225
the War for Independence,

788
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:41,828
he's not going to use
British methods or tactics.

789
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:44,164
And that's just not true.

790
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:46,633
And the other element of it
that is unsuspected,

791
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,603
that we're sometimes
surprised by, I think,

792
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,071
is to the element,

793
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:53,841
to the extent that there are
elements of petite guerre

794
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,443
in the way
that Washington wages this war,

795
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,447
a lot of that
is actually a European import.

796
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:04,117
It's not exclusively
a European import.

797
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:08,689
Washington, and many historians
have gotten this wrong.

798
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:10,457
I think they just didn't
have access

799
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,893
to Washington's papers
and so forth.

800
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,996
Washington is very, very high
on American Indian allies.

801
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,065
He thinks
they're absolutely essential.

802
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,601
He believes that during
the French and Indian War.

803
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,003
He thinks that during the
War for Independence as well.

804
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,739
And largely, that's predicated
on his conviction

805
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:29,443
that you can never train
somebody of European descent

806
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,846
to be as skilled
in American Indian warfare

807
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,882
as an American Indian.

808
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:37,484
And partly it is because
in those economies,

809
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:40,521
most Native men
are from their very youth

810
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:43,590
raised in the dual capacities
as hunters and warriors.

811
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,159
So they really are already
experts

812
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,362
at this kind of warfare

813
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:51,331
by late adolescence,
if not sooner.

814
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:56,236
The other element of this is
in these frontier engagements,

815
00:38:56,303 --> 00:38:58,805
this is the backyard
of many of these Native--

816
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,308
- They know the terrain.
- They know the terrain.

817
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,845
They know all of the tricks
of the terrain.

818
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:06,713
And there's an expression

819
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,616
that Mao Zedong uses
to refer to "people's war,"

820
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,553
that, you know, in people's war,
guerrilla warfare,

821
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,521
the people are the water

822
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:17,591
through which the insurgent fish
are able to swim.

823
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:20,294
I think that there's something
of an analog to that

824
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,029
in Indian country

825
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,299
in these conflicts
that Washington appreciates,

826
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,100
is that this, you know,

827
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:31,071
the wilderness, if you will,
is their sea.

828
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,740
We can't swim through it.

829
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:35,642
We can't do anything in it

830
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,545
without at least
their neutrality.

831
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,814
If they're actively hostile
to us,

832
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:44,551
every single thing we do
is gonna be impossibly hard,

833
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:46,720
and we're gonna be deprived
of intelligence.

834
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:50,457
So Washington values
Native allies foremost

835
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:55,462
for enabling the flow of forces,
logistics, and information

836
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:58,332
across what otherwise
would be contested terrain,

837
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,200
but also, because he recognizes

838
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:03,604
that they have a unique skill
in petite guerre

839
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,772
that he would like
to have married to his forces.

840
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,541
The problem,
from an American perspective,

841
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,844
is most Native nations by 1775
have learned

842
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,180
that the Americans
are foremost interested

843
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,949
in prying Native lands
away from them,

844
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,718
and it makes
American Indian allies

845
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,286
very, very hard to come by,

846
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,388
one of the most remarkable
exceptions

847
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,723
being the Oneida Nation,

848
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,193
which I've indicated here
for that reason.

849
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,097
But in other respects, that
trend I referred to earlier

850
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:33,033
of professionalizing
petite guerre,

851
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,236
the war on the fringes,
that's a European import.

852
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,504
That's a European import.

853
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,873
There are treatises and manuals
published on this

854
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,175
that Washington has read.

855
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,510
They're in his library,
he recommends them.

856
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:45,512
He learns some of this, also,

857
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:48,348
at the tail end
of the French and Indian War,

858
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,384
while he participates
in the Forbes Expedition

859
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,119
against Fort Duquesne.

860
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:54,721
And some
of these European émigrés

861
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,891
are coming over,
extolling their own credentials

862
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:01,628
as being experts
in this kind of warfare.

863
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:04,531
And what's interesting is today,
when we think of partisans,

864
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:07,701
we're thinking of the term in
a World War II context, right,

865
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:11,772
where these are irregular kind
of almost outlaw brigands

866
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,041
behind enemy lines,
blowing up bridges

867
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,510
and being a real pain
in the neck

868
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,112
for regular forces.
- Yes.

869
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,781
- At the derivation of the term,

870
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,616
it does not refer
to that kind of force.

871
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:26,086
What it's referring to
are what we would today

872
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,555
be more inclined
to call special forces,

873
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,958
or elite and light forces

874
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,061
who are operating
on the fringes.

875
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:36,396
And as I said earlier,
at mid-century,

876
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:40,100
they're forming these
by pulling in Europe,

877
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:44,838
hunters and borderers,
and in the case of Austria,

878
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:51,311
Maria Theresa will bring in
some of her irregular subjects

879
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:56,250
from the, you know, the Slavic
marchlands between Christendom

880
00:41:56,316 --> 00:42:00,087
and the former Ottoman,
or still the Ottoman Empire

881
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:03,524
and, you know, turn them
into these light fighters.

882
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,926
But those are also
being professionalized

883
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:08,595
so that by the time
of the American Revolution,

884
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:11,999
Europe is full
of aspiring officers

885
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,801
who envision themselves

886
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:18,238
and declare themselves
to be expert partisans.

887
00:42:18,305 --> 00:42:21,008
And they show up at
George Washington's camp saying,

888
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:24,244
"I'm here,
and I can do this for you."

889
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,512
And Washington at first,

890
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:27,714
I don't think he really knows
what to do with them.

891
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:30,117
And not all of them
speak English.

892
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:32,152
Washington was always
embarrassed by the fact

893
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,887
that he did not speak French.

894
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:36,623
And I can't help but wonder
if in some instances,

895
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,625
he formed these legions

896
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:41,128
just to take
the non-anglophones--

897
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:43,330
- Get them out of the way.
- Put them together

898
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,399
so that somebody else,
somebody could talk to them.

899
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:48,602
But that Armand's Legion
then becomes sort of,

900
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,404
I don't want to call it
a dumping ground,

901
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,473
but Armand shows up and says,
"I'm an expert partisan."

902
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,343
And Washington will form
a partisan corps around him.

903
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,412
And eventually,
these partisan corps

904
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:01,849
are all gonna take on
a legionary form.

905
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:03,984
And a legionary, of course,

906
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:06,153
is a throwback
to the Roman Empire.

907
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,455
But what it refers to
in this particular context

908
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:11,291
is what we would today call
combined-arms formations,

909
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,429
which means they have
different elements of an army

910
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:16,930
in one smaller formation.

911
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:19,266
They will have mounted troops,
they will have infantry,

912
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,169
and they will have a little bit
of artillery with them,

913
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:24,238
which makes them--
- All-purpose.

914
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:26,273
- All-purpose, highly adaptable.

915
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,008
And they become

916
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:33,046
Washington's experts
at petite guerre, right?

917
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,449
These are not
the main force units,

918
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:37,551
but they're capable
of independent operations.

919
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:40,287
And this becomes especially
important to Washington

920
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:43,257
in the southern theater
of operations

921
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:45,125
in the later stages of the war.

922
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:47,928
Once Britain shifts its emphasis
in the colonies

923
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,230
to Charleston
and then the South,

924
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,299
Washington's keeping
his eyes on the prize,

925
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:54,468
his main armies,
his own attention

926
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:57,070
in the Middle Colonies
and New York.

927
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:59,139
But he will send south

928
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:01,308
some of his most
capable officers

929
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:04,711
in Light Horse Harry Lee
and in Nathanael Greene,

930
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:07,848
to wage what historians
will often call

931
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:10,150
the partisan war there.

932
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:11,418
- I suppose,

933
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,454
or I get the impression
that the main claim to fame

934
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:18,959
for the Polish contributor
to this American effort,

935
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:20,627
Casimir Pulaski,

936
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:23,063
he gets credit for saving
George Washington's life.

937
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,798
Is that accurate?

938
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:29,703
- John: Well, I don't know if
that's his main claim to fame.

939
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,041
The other most famous Polish
officer is Tadeusz Kosciuszko,

940
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:36,944
who is even better remembered,
I think,

941
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,214
because he remains
invaluable to Washington

942
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,549
until the end of the conflict.

943
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:45,319
- Managed to live longer.
- He managed to live longer.

944
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:47,221
He has invaluable
engineering skills.

945
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:50,624
And so he is the great
Polish patriot

946
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,293
of the American Revolution.

947
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,397
The other thing, not all
of these foreign officers

948
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:59,600
seem to be as committed

949
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:02,903
to the lowercase "r"
republican principles

950
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,839
for which the Americans
are fighting in this war.

951
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:09,676
The Marquis de Lafayette
is absolutely fully on board

952
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:11,111
with these
republican principles,

953
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:13,213
and so is Tadeusz Kosciuszko.

954
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,782
Others are less interested
in the politics

955
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:18,585
than the opportunity
to win martial distinction.

956
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:21,989
And Pulaski is at first
put in charge

957
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:24,458
of all of the Continental Army's
cavalry.

958
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:26,593
But he does not get along
very well

959
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,662
with his subordinate
American officers,

960
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:31,899
and so Washington gives him
a command of a legion,

961
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:36,303
and he goes south to help
in the siege of Savannah,

962
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,572
which the British
had grabbed early in the war.

963
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,340
And Pulaski goes down there

964
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,876
with one of these
legionary formations,

965
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:44,711
and I would say
he's most famous,

966
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:49,049
as a former resident
of the greater Savannah area,

967
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:53,353
as dying heroically
at the front of his legion

968
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:57,024
in the unsuccessful siege
of Savannah,

969
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,826
attempt to liberate that city.

970
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:02,896
- And I can't resist
at least a reference

971
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:07,067
to "Light-Horse Harry" Lee,
who was the father of,

972
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:09,837
I suppose,
an even more famous general.

973
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,438
- John: Yeah, absolutely.

974
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:15,008
That is the father
of Robert E. Lee.

975
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:17,311
And I think what's
sort of interesting

976
00:46:17,377 --> 00:46:20,280
about this
is Light-Horse Harry Lee

977
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:23,684
is, without a doubt,
one of the most talented,

978
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,856
one of the most able officers
of the American Revolution.

979
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:32,593
Washington holds him
in exceptionally high regard.

980
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:35,662
And by the time
of the War of 1812,

981
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,900
the party, the political party

982
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,603
that most of the veterans
of the Revolutionary War

983
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:45,305
are associated with,
the Federalists,

984
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:47,407
Federalists aren't real crazy
about the idea

985
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,543
of going back to war again
with Great Britain.

986
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,445
And, again,
these are mostly coastal cities

987
00:46:51,512 --> 00:46:55,516
that are fully embedded
in Britain's mercantile empire

988
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:57,384
and don't want to go.

989
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:00,487
And Light-Horse Harry Lee
is one of these Federalists

990
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:02,556
who doesn't want to go to war.

991
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:05,292
And a mob of angry warmongers

992
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,765
actually treats him
very, very poorly,

993
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:14,301
and he develops health issues
from which he never recovers.

994
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:19,339
And sort of a sad, sad story
of a hero of the revolution

995
00:47:19,406 --> 00:47:21,642
is abused by his own countrymen,

996
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:27,281
and his son becomes, in some
sectors, quite venerated,

997
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:30,050
but increasingly regarded
quite justly

998
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:34,221
as somebody who forswore
his oath to the Constitution

999
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:36,023
and fought
against the United States,

1000
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:38,592
a country that his dad
had helped create.

1001
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,460
- That's the remarkable thing,
isn't it,

1002
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:44,164
that these two generations,
during their lifetimes,

1003
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:49,169
things change so radically from
the revolution to the Civil War?

1004
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,337
- Yeah.

1005
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:53,507
It's also a healthy reminder
that Americans

1006
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:57,110
have vehemently and violently
disagreed with one another

1007
00:47:57,177 --> 00:48:02,015
on a number of questions
for a very, very long time.

1008
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:04,184
- Strategy as we get toward,

1009
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:06,954
of course, we have
the advantage of foreknowledge

1010
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,390
when it comes to the timeline
of the American Revolution.

1011
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:15,362
But as we get towards 1781,
what's the British strategy,

1012
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:16,964
what's the American strategy,

1013
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,333
and how does it play out
at Yorktown?

1014
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:22,202
- So, Washington's strategy
is oftentimes

1015
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:24,071
called a war of posts.

1016
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:27,541
And by the end
of that disastrous 1776 season,

1017
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:30,911
he's resolved that he's gonna
fight the war his way.

1018
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,412
He's gonna kind of circle,

1019
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:35,449
tighten his circle of trust,
the council he's gonna keep,

1020
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:37,417
the advice he'll take.

1021
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:40,821
Interestingly, that that
small circle is all young men.

1022
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:42,089
It's a bunch of tyros.

1023
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:43,891
It's people
like Nathanael Greene,

1024
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:46,760
Alexander Hamilton,
Henry Knox,

1025
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:50,864
the Marquis de Lafayette,
not the more senior voices.

1026
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,367
- Norman: Maybe tend to be
more admiring of Washington?

1027
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,569
- I think so,
a little bit more deferential,

1028
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:59,273
a little less hungry themselves
to perhaps supersede Washington,

1029
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,708
to overall command
of the Continental Army.

1030
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,144
And what Washington
is gonna try to do

1031
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,345
for the balance of the conflict

1032
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:06,780
is look for an opportunity
to land

1033
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,583
what he considers to be
brilliant strokes.

1034
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,286
And so he realizes
that the center of gravity

1035
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:15,756
for the War for Independence
is in fact his army,

1036
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,658
the main body
of the Continental Army.

1037
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:19,393
He can't win the war in a day,

1038
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,395
but he could lose the war
in a day

1039
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,663
if he gets
that Continental Army,

1040
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:24,398
the main body
of the Continental Army,

1041
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,700
into a fight in which
it is annihilated.

1042
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,770
So he's got to stay
at a distance,

1043
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,339
at a distance,
but not so far away

1044
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:34,274
that he's not capable
of coming in

1045
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:36,910
and landing a jab here,
a jab there.

1046
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:40,380
But he's always waiting
for an opportunity to come in

1047
00:49:40,447 --> 00:49:45,586
and land a, not a knockout blow,
but a brilliant stroke.

1048
00:49:46,854 --> 00:49:50,157
He suffers no illusions that
he can land a knockout blow.

1049
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:52,459
But he realizes,
whereas his own army

1050
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:55,629
is the center of gravity
for the revolution,

1051
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:57,998
the British Army is a proxy

1052
00:49:58,065 --> 00:50:01,301
for British political will
and popular will.

1053
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:04,338
And if he can embarrass
that army

1054
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:07,541
significantly enough
or often enough,

1055
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:09,209
that the will
to continue this fight

1056
00:50:09,276 --> 00:50:10,677
will erode in Great Britain.

1057
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:12,446
So he is savvy enough to realize

1058
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,748
that this is a war
of political will

1059
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,783
in which he is engaged.

1060
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:22,456
And the Battle of Yorktown is
this ultimate brilliant stroke.

1061
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:24,558
There's nothing
about the Battle of Yorktown

1062
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,995
that necessarily
precludes Britain

1063
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:30,631
from continuing
to wage the fight.

1064
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,500
But at this point, it's
a question of political will,

1065
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:36,303
and it's a question
of interests.

1066
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,172
The important thing
to consider here

1067
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:39,406
is, I've already mentioned,

1068
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:44,044
in '78, America wins
the open alliance of France.

1069
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,981
And not an alliance with Spain,

1070
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,051
but because this has now become
the second world war,

1071
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:53,754
Spain is another enemy
of Great Britain,

1072
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,323
so there's another
mighty European nation

1073
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,393
that at least is the foe
of my foe,

1074
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:03,297
which makes them something
of a friend.

1075
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:05,332
Once that happens,

1076
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,868
even though this is the
American War for Independence,

1077
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:10,170
this is no longer
Britain's main effort.

1078
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,272
They've got
way more important things

1079
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,808
to worry about
once France and Spain

1080
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:17,211
are fighting them openly
in this war.

1081
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:19,913
And Americans always
overestimate

1082
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,916
their economic importance
to Britain's mercantile empire.

1083
00:51:22,983 --> 00:51:26,854
It's, the Caribbean is
way, way more important.

1084
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,356
And that, then,
becomes the prize

1085
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:32,759
for these competing
European empires at that time.

1086
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:34,962
And so Britain sort of,

1087
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:41,168
you know, puts the American
colonies on the back burner

1088
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:44,671
for a couple of years,
and then decides in 1780,

1089
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:47,140
it perceives that there may be
low-hanging fruit

1090
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:49,243
to be plucked
in the southern colonies,

1091
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,278
thinking,
we mentioned earlier,

1092
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:54,414
these coastal cities
that are bastions of loyalism.

1093
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:55,616
"Let's go after Charleston.

1094
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:57,584
"We tried it once before,
we didn't get it.

1095
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:58,886
So we'll go after Charleston."

1096
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:00,888
And then we can use something

1097
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:03,891
that would later be called
an oil-spot strategy, right?

1098
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,826
All you gotta do is grab
one little base,

1099
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:08,128
and then from that base
where you've got solid support,

1100
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,931
you can start bleeding outward

1101
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:12,533
and eventually
win back everything.

1102
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,870
So that's Britain's strategy
in 1780 and 1781.

1103
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:20,007
And initially,
they meet resounding success

1104
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:23,177
at Charleston,
at the Battle of Camden,

1105
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:25,846
and it, you know,
it's looking pretty good.

1106
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:29,216
But it turns into a bitter civil
war in these southern colonies,

1107
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:31,151
and the Lord Cornwallis
will discover

1108
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:34,154
once he's facing
Nathanael Greene,

1109
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:36,523
who comes down
to take overall command

1110
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,793
after Gates' loss
at the Battle of Camden,

1111
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,330
Greene is a really cagey
antagonist,

1112
00:52:44,398 --> 00:52:47,901
and Cornwallis realizes
he's not gonna be able to win

1113
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:50,904
by chasing elements
of the Continental Army

1114
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:53,207
or the South Carolina
provincial forces

1115
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:55,542
all around the backcountry.

1116
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:58,579
And so he's gonna move out
to the coast

1117
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:02,749
and take up a position where
he can be more easily supplied,

1118
00:53:02,816 --> 00:53:04,318
and that's at Yorktown.

1119
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:07,621
And as they dig themselves
into a fortified position,

1120
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:10,357
they don't realize that they're
actually digging themselves

1121
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:12,726
into something of a grave.

1122
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:15,262
American victory there
would not have been possible

1123
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,164
were it not for the French.
- Norman: Lafayette.

1124
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,899
- There's a decisive
naval engagement

1125
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:23,270
at the beginning of this,
the Battle of the Capes,

1126
00:53:23,337 --> 00:53:27,641
in which a, you know,
a relief force is turned away.

1127
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:30,677
Tactically, for naval battles,
it's a draw,

1128
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:32,312
but strategically,
it's hugely important

1129
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,348
because a British relief force
cannot land,

1130
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:36,517
and Cornwallis is stuck.

1131
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:39,720
And the comte de Rochambeau
is here at the head

1132
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:43,056
of a huge contingent
of French forces.

1133
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,659
Originally, they'd been up
outside of New York,

1134
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,662
still thinking that
that was gonna be the place

1135
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,898
to land the brilliant stroke.

1136
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:53,634
But when they see what's
developed, then, at Yorktown,

1137
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,302
it's really a remarkable feat

1138
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:59,239
to march all the way, you know,
from the outskirts of New York,

1139
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:02,709
all the way down
to the Virginia Peninsula,

1140
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:04,478
near the tip
of the Virginia Peninsula,

1141
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,413
and to invest Yorktown.

1142
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,284
And it is a thoroughly
European victory.

1143
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:14,821
It is the quintessence
of European siegecraft,

1144
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:18,225
at this stage,
you know, in history.

1145
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:23,330
There's nothing really remotely
American about this victory,

1146
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:25,499
and even the composition
of the forces

1147
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,301
isn't entirely American.

1148
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:29,603
There are German speakers
on both sides

1149
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,905
in the fight
of the Battle of Yorktown.

1150
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:35,442
But as I said,
that one victory does not mean

1151
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:37,845
that Britain has to quit
the war against--

1152
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:39,279
- Norman: They just have
other priorities.

1153
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:40,447
- They have other priorities.

1154
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:41,682
And so, in fact,

1155
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:44,084
the war will carry on
for two more years,

1156
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:46,453
but not really in the colonies.

1157
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,754
And it becomes a challenge

1158
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:50,257
for Washington
to maintain good order,

1159
00:54:50,324 --> 00:54:54,161
morale, and discipline,
because the war is not over,

1160
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:57,030
but there's not a ton
to be done

1161
00:54:58,031 --> 00:55:01,301
until eventually
the British do concede

1162
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:05,439
to a peace settlement
with the colonists.

1163
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:09,576
- Going forward to, say,
the Battle of New Orleans,

1164
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,311
then, War of 1812,

1165
00:55:11,678 --> 00:55:16,550
do the Americans use those
European continental tactics

1166
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,552
that they have learned
during the revolution,

1167
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,855
or are we back to more of a
guerrilla warfare kind of fight?

1168
00:55:21,922 --> 00:55:23,257
- Well, so, this is another case

1169
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:25,125
in which, you know,
the Battle of New Orleans

1170
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:26,860
is so alluring,

1171
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:30,964
partly because it is, you know,
the third of the trifecta

1172
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:34,768
of foolish British episodes
that people'd like to point to,

1173
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,770
but also, because the force

1174
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:39,373
that wins
the Battle of New Orleans

1175
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:43,744
seems to be
so thoroughly American, right?

1176
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,813
It is a hodgepodge, motley crew,

1177
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:51,285
with American Indians,
Creole pirates,

1178
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:55,622
U.S. Army regulars,
Tennessee militia forces,

1179
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:57,291
other militia forces.

1180
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:01,261
It is about as motley
and diverse of a force

1181
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:05,365
as you can possibly imagine.

1182
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,534
In American mythology,

1183
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:10,804
the thing that's
not often acknowledged

1184
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:14,408
is the bulk of the casualties
inflicted on the British there

1185
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:18,679
are inflicted by U.S. artillery,
which is, you know, not only

1186
00:56:18,745 --> 00:56:20,614
part of the
professional establishment,

1187
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:21,982
the regular U.S. Army,

1188
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,885
but one of the most
technical branches

1189
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:29,489
of that military that requires
specific, you know, training

1190
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,558
and the technologies
to produce it.

1191
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,293
So the War of 1812

1192
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:39,633
is a case of having to relearn
hard lessons in many respects,

1193
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,735
because at the end
of the American Revolution,

1194
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:44,071
notwithstanding the fact
that the Continental Army,

1195
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:45,339
this army that, you know,

1196
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:48,609
sallies forth
out of Valley Forge in 1778,

1197
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:50,844
deserves the lion's share
of the credit,

1198
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:54,515
along with the French, right,
for eventual American victory.

1199
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:59,219
At the end of the war,
Americans like to pat themselves

1200
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:00,554
and their communities
on their back

1201
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:01,755
and say it was the militia,

1202
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:03,891
because so many Americans
had served in the militia

1203
00:57:03,957 --> 00:57:05,926
at some capacity during the war.

1204
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:07,728
And one of the axes

1205
00:57:07,794 --> 00:57:10,297
that they had to grind
against Mother Britain

1206
00:57:10,364 --> 00:57:14,735
at the beginning of the war
was against the militarism

1207
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:20,140
of, you know, quartering
British forces in homes and the,

1208
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:24,444
you know, so Americans
have this congenital distrust

1209
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:27,981
of standing armies
or professional armies.

1210
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:32,019
They had to concede principle
to practicality

1211
00:57:32,085 --> 00:57:33,820
during the revolution,
but at the end of it,

1212
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:35,722
they want to go right back
to principle.

1213
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,792
And they think that they
don't need a professional force,

1214
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:41,261
and they'll go without one
until they'll have,

1215
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:42,963
you know,
disasters will compel them

1216
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,164
to raise one again

1217
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:47,134
and put Mad Anthony Wayne
at its head,

1218
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:51,305
who will win a decisive victory
at the Battle of Fallen Timbers,

1219
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,240
which will help pry
the Ohio Country

1220
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:56,743
from the Indigenous inhabitants
of that region.

1221
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,312
But then, when that's over,
they,

1222
00:57:58,378 --> 00:58:00,380
again, they kind of cut it down
to the bone.

1223
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:03,717
So at the beginning
of the War of 1812,

1224
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:05,786
the defense policy
of the United States

1225
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:10,090
is to rely overwhelmingly
on militia forces.

1226
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:15,062
And they relearn again
how undependable they are,

1227
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:17,497
especially for an offensive war.

1228
00:58:17,564 --> 00:58:20,200
And it's worth remembering,
in the War of 1812,

1229
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:22,703
it's the United States
that picked the fight

1230
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:26,373
and also picked the target,
which was to invade Canada.

1231
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,076
- Norman: Yeah.
- But by the end of that war,

1232
00:58:29,142 --> 00:58:32,579
sort of the same process
has played out again,

1233
00:58:32,646 --> 00:58:36,183
and the difference is
at the end of the War of 1812,

1234
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,786
the professional
U.S. military establishment

1235
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:43,557
has sort of proven itself
indispensable,

1236
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:46,660
and many historians
would point to that war

1237
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:49,463
and the emergence
of figures like Winfield Scott

1238
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,932
as being the birth or rebirth

1239
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:55,903
of the modern
American profession of arms.

1240
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:57,671
- John Hall,
it's been fascinating.

1241
00:58:57,738 --> 00:58:59,773
- Thank you, Norman,
happy to have been here.

1242
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,142
- Some great discoveries there.
