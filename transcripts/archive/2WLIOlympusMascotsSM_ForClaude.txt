00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,072
- You just kinda
have to move your hands

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,740
and hope for the best.

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:10,811
Simply no other job like this
I can think of.

4
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,413
? Flexin' like a winner ?

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,882
- The most important thing,
I think,

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,617
is to have fun.

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,219
? Got it all ?

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,288
? Got, got, got it all ?

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,493
- So I'm a little bit like a
superhero, in a way. [laughs]

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,362
? Winner ?
? Winner ?

11
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,330
- You have everybody
in the stadium

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,965
looking at you,
and you just run out.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,702
It's a big responsibility,
I would say.

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,841
? Hey, hey, hey, hey ?

15
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,744
? Winner ?
? Winner ?

- Brian Adams: Olympus Mascots
was created

19
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:18,378
at some point back in the 1960s.

20
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,515
We have 250-ish total employees.

21
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,521
- Amber Micoliczyk:
They reached out to me

22
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,723
and they're like, "Hey, do you
wanna be a mascot sewer?"

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,525
And I'm like, "I have never
heard of anything

24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,928
like that before, so sure,
why not?"

25
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,265
- Brian: We've probably done
25,000 to 30,000 mascots

26
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,133
through the years.

27
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,936
- Steve Deau:
We did a forklift,

28
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,205
like a wearable
forklift costume.

29
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,807
And it had the forks
in the front

30
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,408
that just kinda went up
and down.

31
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,043
And a hidden button
on the other side

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,312
for, like, the backup noise.

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,748
Full-body robot.

The Racing Sausages
come through here.

36
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,655
We probably make new ones every,
I don't know, five years.

37
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,624
- We're working on a
very high-profile project

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,160
right now
that I can't tell you about.

00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,536
- Brittany Jacob-Thacker:
Most of our costumes

41
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,706
are in between 60 to 120 hours,
with the average of them

42
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,709
being probably in the
70 to 80-hour range.

43
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,913
We consider, like, the
performer's activity level.

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,881
We go a lot by, like,
height range too

45
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,484
to make sure it fits, like, a
certain height range of person.

46
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,685
There's a lot
of different aspects

47
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,154
that all kinda go into it.

48
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,491
- So when I see the picture,
I have to navigate

49
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,794
how I'm going to make this
a 3D thing.

50
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,531
I go on to the mannequin,
I start measuring out things

51
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,401
so that I know what the
proportions are

52
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,604
so I know how to make something
what it should look like

53
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,339
on the form.

54
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,610
- Brittany:
So a lot of it's fur.

55
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,779
We have fur, Tempo, double knit

56
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,381
are probably the big ones
that we use.

57
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,283
I particularly like
when we do fur costumes

58
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,385
just 'cause it's cool to put
different colors together

59
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,589
and different textures.

every single year.

Pro sports teams,

65
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,169
you know,
representing everything

66
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,372
down to even elementary schools.

00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,486
? Give it to me,
give it to me ?

70
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,190
? Give it to me,
whoo! ?

71
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,262
? Give it, give it,
give it to me ?

? Give it, give it to me ?

73
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,141
- It's very strange, sometimes,
to just be like,

74
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,043
watching a Packer game
or something,

75
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,045
and a commercial comes on
and it's like,

76
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,380
"Oh, I made that," you know?

77
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,216
It's like, you know, it gives me
a certain level of pride

78
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:13,287
and just, like, this costume
made it onto TV

79
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,623
and looks pretty good.

80

- John Sidem: Feels like
art come to life.

81
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:21,195
Like, our art that
we're working on here,

82
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:26,166
you know, becomes this
full-scale, realized thing.

83
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,337
? Whoo! ?

84
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,272
- And then, it's like,

85
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,208
you forget about
all of that hard work,

86
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,810
and you're like, "Wow, like,
this is what

87
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,279
it comes down to at the end."

88
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,515

work here are just amazing.

It's the reason why I come back
every day.

90
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,519
It's the reason why
I have a smile on my face.

91
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,921
It's the reason why I love
coming to work

92
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,456
because it's a great group
of people

93
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,592
and we get to make some
really fun stuff.
