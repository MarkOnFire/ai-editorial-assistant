[gentle music]

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:16,984
- Rebecca Lakowske: People have
no idea what they're looking at.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,586
It stands out just because it's
not something you see

4
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,022
everywhere, every day.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,657
- Ryan Lakowske:
Our mold graveyard has become

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,661
an unintentional attraction
to a lot of people.

7
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,364
This weird odditity of a field

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,435
that has a bunch of skeletons
left over from projects.

9
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,508
There's a lot of life left
in that graveyard.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,214
I'm Ryan Lakowske,
and this is my wife Rebecca.

11
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,817
We own FAST Fiberglass.
[hammering]

12
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,789
We make a lot
of fiberglass animals

13
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,192
and statues of all kinds.

14
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,260
And waterpark slides,

15
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,596
or anything that the industry
calls for.

16
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,665
[television static]
- We found a clue

17
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,735
in our mystery about where these
big critters come from.

18
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,537
- Rebecca: The beginnings
of FAST really started

19
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,140
in the late '60s, early '70s.

20
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,476
That's where the whole idea
had started.

21
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,180
The business switched hands
to another owner two more times,

22
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,017
and then in 2020, Ryan and I
purchased the business.

23
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,220
[equipment buzzing]

24
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,923
One of the cool things about
having a business

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,992
that is well established
and well known

26
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,927
is that there are a lot
of notable projects

27
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,830
that have already been done.

28
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,565
[bright music]

29
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,103
- Ryan: One of the most
recognizable projects

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,438
that FAST has been involved with

31
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,440
is the Freshwater Fishing
Hall of Fame

32
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,976
up in Hayward, Wisconsin.

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,345
A lot of people have seen
the pink elepant.

34
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,046
That's a big known one.

35
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,648
- Rebecca: The Paul Bunyan
in the Dells

36
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,450
is another one that
people recognize,

37
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,852
especially for its size.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,991
We have products that have gone
all over the United States.

39
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,994
- Ryan: 30-foot eyeball, that
was in Chicago for a while,

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,665
and dogs balancing taxi cabs
on their nose in New York.

41
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,335
The company's had a past history
of quite a few cool projects.

42
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,304
But we're doing our own thing
now too,

43
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,041
and we got a few cool ones
under our belt.

44
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,710
Some of the current pieces
we're working on here

45
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:29,116
is a nine-foot dog that we're
making for service vet dogs.

46
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,052
We're making a Santa sleigh
golf cart.

47
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:36,590
We're hoping to get that
in the parade this year.

48
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,559
We just finished up a shark.

49
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,928
It's for a car wash
down in Georgia.

50
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,931
And you drive right
through the mouth.

51
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,333
- One of our bigger, more
notable projects that we did

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,936
was a flamingo that's at the
Tampa Bay airport,

53
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,338
and this was one where we worked
with an artist on it.

54
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:55,642
It's a 26-foot flamingo neck,
as well as the feet.

55
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,046
An airport has hundreds
of thousands of people

56
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,415
that view it,
so it was a fun way

57
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,484
to really get our name
out there.

58
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,187
- Some days, it feels
like playing, you know?

59
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,591
It feels like, you know, you can
take other people's ideas

60
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,661
and dreams and try to turn 'em
into reality.

61
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,134
The main thing that we've
changed since owning the place

62
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,439
is we've brought a lot more
technology into it.

63
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,441
A lot of the custom jobs
that we do now

64
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,942
are done through the computer,

65
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,046
so it eliminates a lot
of the trial and error.

66
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,986
- Rebecca: So Ryan and I have
three kids.

67
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,854
It's been really fun
as they get older

68
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,525
to see them become more involved
and more interested.

69
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,261
They're able to learn
how a business runs

70
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,131
and be able to see where they
can fit into it.

71
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,467
After school, they run over
and check the catalog box,

72
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,068
and if it's empty,
they go get catalogs

73
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,471
and they put it in the box.

74
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,440
As our oldest is now 12,

75
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,776
he's becoming more and more
interested in the business,

76
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,079
and it's really fun to watch him
grow and learn.

77
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,015
He is really into technology,

78
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,350
definitely takes after his
father.

79
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,818
- See that?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,255
- Instead of it being so tight,
it turns into a big, wide one.

81
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,959
- Rebecca: So he's been learning
a lot of the computer programs.

82
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,128
- Dexton Lakowske: Some skills
that I've gained in school

83
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:25,299
goes directly to what I do here
because it's like,

84
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,135
science, engineering, math,
and technology.

85
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,137
- They find where
they fit in here

86
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,906
and what they can do,
and they really enjoy it.

87
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,309
[child grunting]
- Okay.

88
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,011
- Rebecca: It's a
pretty big space for kids,

89
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:42,749
and what kid wouldn't just
absolutely love it here?

90
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:43,951
- Get that laid out then

91
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,452
and just start putting
the black down?

92
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,620
- I think I would.

93
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,222
The rest of the team too,
I mean,

94
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,158
honestly, they're starting
to feel like family too.

95
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,594
The years of experience that
they all have under their belt.

96
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,031
They've been a part of this
company before we owned it.

97
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,299
They've taught me so much.

98
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,169
I couldn't do it without them.

99
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,304
Of course, I want the company
to grow.

100
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,106
I want it to be here
for the kids.

101
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,875
The most important part to me

102
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:11,545
is the business itself
is still running.

103
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,248
And it's still taking care of
not only our family,

104
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,383
but the family of all
of the employees

105
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,119
and people that we have here
with us.

106
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,488
- Rebecca: FAST has built
a good name over the years,

107
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,491
and it's not only our job
but responsibility

108
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,360
to keep that going.

109
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,731
