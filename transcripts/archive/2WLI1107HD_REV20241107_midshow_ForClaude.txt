I started my visit in the tavern
Fred Smith built

00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:20,999
to chat
with Ann Grzywnowicz,

8
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:23,834
Operations Manager
of the Friends of Fred Smith,

9
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:27,291
to uncover what's so special
about this county park.

10
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,125
- Ann Grzywnowicz:
I think what makes it
the most special

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,583
is that
all of the statues

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,417
were created by one artist,
Fred Smith,

13
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,083
and he created them all
over a 16-year period,

14
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,999
and so he was working very hard
throughout those 16 years.

15
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,750
He was very inspired.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,375
- And what types of,
I guess, objects

17
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,875
are featured in the park?

18
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,792
- He kind of took inspiration
from many different areas.

19
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:54,500
He really liked to focus on some
of the local people around,

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,792
but also figures of
national importance.

21
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,125
So, there's a Paul Bunyan,
Abe Lincoln.

22
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,875
There's a plaque that has
a Statue of Liberty on it.

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,999
He really honored and respected
the Native American community,

24
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,875
so there's several
Native American statues.

25
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,875
- Awesome, and art conservation
is a big component here.

26
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:17,250
- Yes, it is very crucial that
we preserve the statues

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,792
because of the harsh Wisconsin
winters, the weather,

28
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:24,250
and just having concrete
statues outside

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,250
is not the ideal location.

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,834
We have to hire
two professionals that

31
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:33,417
come and do the main repairs,
which is the stability issues

32
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,709
to make sure that the limbs
aren't falling off the statues,

33
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,208
that none of them
are falling down,

34
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,625
because that does happen.

35
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,208
- So, I went to see that
conservation work in action,

36
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,834
meeting Ben Caguioa,
a member of the team

37
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,999
working to keep
the statues standing.

38
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,875
- Hi, Ben.
- Ben Caguioa: Oh, hi.

39
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,542
- What are you
working on?

40
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,458
- I'm working on a blown-out
ankle on this sculpture.

41
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,417
I've already welded
some stainless steel

42
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,291
to the original armature,

43
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,375
and now,
I'm in the process

44
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,500
of replacing
all these broken pieces off.

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,792
So I've just mixed up
some marine-grade epoxy,

46
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,834
and I'll be gluing in the
pieces kind of like a puzzle.

47
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,999
- Can you show us a little bit
of what that looks like?

48
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:14,792
- Ben Caguioa: Yeah!

49
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,999
So, right now, I'm just kind of
pre-fitting them

50
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:20,709
to make sure that I can get them
all into position,

51
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,125
and this is more
to figure out the order

52
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,667
in which
I need to glue things.

53
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,500
And I think
I'm in a good spot.

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,875
So now, this is ready
for me to put some adhesive on

55
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,083
so I could permanently glue it
in place.

56
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,959
- So, it's literally like
putting a puzzle together.

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,999
- The most important part
is not locking a piece out.

58
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,999
I was an art major
in college,

59

a little steadier income.
