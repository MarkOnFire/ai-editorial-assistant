a beautiful community.

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,385
It really is.

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,087
This greater La Crosse community

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,123
here on the banks
of the Upper Mississippi,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,059
this incomparable
natural beauty,

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:31,465
and the people are just so nice,
the nicest people I've ever met.

10
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,500
- Eva Marie Restel: We have
a rich arts culture.

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,403
It attracts musicians,
it attracts artists.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,239
And the musicians talk about
there's this energy

13
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,741
that comes from the audience,

14
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,143
and they just feel like they're
on the edge of the seat

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,645
and they're, like,
right there with them.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,349
And so it makes it particularly
exciting to perform here.

17

- Alexander: This is what
a conductor dreams of,

18
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,489
and that kind of cloud nine is
where we're at in La Crosse,

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,191

- Rachel Barton Pine:
I always love soloing

44
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,042
with orchestras in Wisconsin.

45
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,212
It's such a beautiful state,
and I live in Chicago.

46
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,780
I'm a lifelong Chicagoan,

47
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,783
so I have a special
patriotic feeling in my heart

48
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,985
for anything in the Midwest.

49
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,955
But, you know, there's such
a wonderful enthusiasm

50
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,659
from the public of orchestras
like the La Crosse Symphony.

51
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,994
It makes it not just
an artistically rewarding,

52
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,097
but also a very personally
rewarding experience for me

53
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,033
as a touring artist.

I love being out and about
in the community.

68
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,308
I love meeting people.
[orchestra playing]

69
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,244
Okay, now, in these four bars,

70
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,547
I need a shape that
goes to forte and then back.

71
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,315
But of course, the pinnacle

72
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,619
is what we do together
on this stage

73
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:24,157
for three extremely intense
three-hour rehearsals

74
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:28,929
that culminate in what is often
a magnificent performance.

75
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,131
Can we all add a crescendo here?

76
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,367
- Eva: We have 70 musicians,

77
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:37,204
really talented musicians
from a three-hour radius,

78
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,239
and they really like
working with Alexander.

79
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,675
He's able to bring out the best
in all of them,

80
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,210
and they love that.

81
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:47,114
It's a special camaraderie that
he creates with the musicians.

82
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,383
He's fun to work with.
- Alexander: Mary Beth, I just,

83
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,784
push it a little ahead here,
okay?

84
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,419
We have been able
to put together

85
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,888
such a beautiful collection
of individuals

86
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,125
from this entire region,
this Coulee Region,

87
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:02,362
that truly the performance
is the culmination

88
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,199
of all of that intensity
of those rehearsals.

89
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,901
And, you know, whether you're
the La Crosse Symphony

90
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:12,239
or the New York Philharmonic,
if you can do that regularly,

91
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,008
it just, it just doesn't get
better as a conductor.

92
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:16,577
It doesn't get better than that.

93

[orchestra playing]

94
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,015
Oh, it's already so wonderful.

95
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,952
Simply put,
I'm having the time of my life,

96
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,154
and it's all thanks
to La Crosse.

97
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,322
I love this place.

Maurice Ravel.

00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,237
I am tall compared
to Maurice Ravel.

114
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,639
He went up to about my shoulder.

115
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:29,476
He was, in the French tradition,
a dandy.

116
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:34,681
And yet, at the age of 40,
despite his diminutive stature,

117
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:39,353
he insisted on enlisting
for the French cause

118
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,854
in World War I.

119

And only Ravel--

120
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:46,393
There is a very famous
photograph of him

121
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,329
ready to go to the front
in the winter of 1915,

122
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,798
and he's in one of those
very World War I,

123
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,067
you know, steel helmets,

124
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:57,604

127

So, take joy and comfort
in this beautiful music,

128
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,884
for me, the greatest
of all French composers.

129
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,219
And take joy.

130
