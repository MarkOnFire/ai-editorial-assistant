Welcome to
<i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,166
I'm your host,
Angela Fitzgerald,

29
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,083
and I've run away
with the circus

30
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,333
here at Circus World.

31
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,999
Nestled along the river
in Baraboo,

32
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,291
this site
was originally home

33
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,999
to the Ringling Bros.
Circus,

34
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,333
beginning
in the late 1800s.

35
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,999
[fast tempo circus march]

36
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:35,083
Today, Circus World
offers high-flying acts,
[audience gasps]

37
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,834
exciting stunts,

38
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,667
and animal tricks,

39
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,333
all while offering
a look into the past

40
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,083
when circuses
were huge traveling productions

41
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,000
that were wildly popular.

42

00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,583
Three, two, one!

[cannon pops,

46
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:56,458
- As a Wisconsin
Historical Society site,

47
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,875
guests can tour exhibits,

48
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,667
walk through the historic
Ringling Bros.'
Winter Quarters,

49
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,333
and check out
the largest collection

50
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,917
of circus wagons
in the world.

51
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,333
Every summer,
the annual Big Top Parade

52
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,917
puts some of those wagons
on display,

53
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,625
weaving through
the streets of Baraboo.

54
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,458
Before we step
deeper into the ring here,

55
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,125
let's dive
into our first story...

56
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,458
[shimmery music]

57
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,834
...where we fly
to New Richmond

58
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,999
to catch up with

59
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:25,999
a mother and son team

60
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,999
preparing their flocks
for race day.

61
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,625
[gentle music]

62
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,999
[ethereal music]

63
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,750
[acoustic guitar]

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,917
Waking up to greet the day...

65
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,083
- 4:20 every morning,
my alarm goes off.

66
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:44,667
I catch all the birds
and get them in the truck.

67
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,792
- Liz Beukema has had
this same routine

68
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,625
for more than
a decade.

69
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,999
- Liz Beukema:
That may be why... [laughs]

70
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,834
May be why
it's a low-participation sport.

71
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:59,125
- Pigeon racing became popular
in Belgium 200 years ago,

72
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,583
and has spread worldwide.

73
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,875
- Fond du Lac has a really
active pigeon community.

74
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,583
Milwaukee...

75
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,750
La Crosse has a big club
down there.

76
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,083
- But for Liz,
finding other female racers

77
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,792
is not very common.

78
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,999
- It's actually fairly rare.

79
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:18,999
There's not many of us,
but it's fun to find each other.
[laughs]

80
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,999
So, they're gonna come out.

81
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,250
I'm gonna start
with this first one.

82
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,333
[Liz claps]

83
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:28,375
We release birds about half
an hour after sun up, ideally.

84
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,500
- Garrett Beukema: I guess
it's sort of a rare sport,

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,917
and it's always changing.

86
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,417
- Even more rare...

87
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:36,999
- We're the only ones
I know of.

88
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,999
- A mom and son
competing against each other.

89
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:43,834
- Garrett: This is one
of our young birds.

90
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:44,959
- Garrett got his start

91
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,999
after someone gifted him
racing pigeons.

92
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:52,999
- We started with 10,
and now we have 200.
[chuckles]

93
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,625
- For Garrett and Liz,

94
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
life on the farm
would never be the same.

95
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,999
- I started because
Garrett was 10,

96
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,999
and he couldn't drive his birds
down the road to train.

97
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,875
I was just kind of
along for the ride.

98
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,875
I never had a team
at first.

99
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,083
Garrett flew for two years
without me having a team.

100
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,709
I try to get
all scientific,

101
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,667
and Garrett's just like,
"Ah, it's all good."

102
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,709
And then, he ends up winning
every week.

103
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,333
- Winning also requires a lot
of time spent with your birds.

104
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,999
- Garrett: You're up
every morning and training,

105
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,999
and every weekend,
you're racing.

106
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,625
And it gets pretty busy.

107
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,000
- But we start out slow.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,083
We'll go half a mile,
we'll go two miles,

109
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,083
we'll go five miles,
and just practice.

110
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,000
They flew 90 miles this morning
on a training run.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,625
- Pigeon racing
can sometimes cover 400 miles,

112
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,999
and the first bird home
in the fastest time wins.

113
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,500
- We want them
to have visual clues.

114
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,583
I want them
to see the river

115
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,999
and know that "I need
to get across the river

116
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,291
in order to get home."

117
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,875
- On race day,

118
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,792
the farm is quiet

119
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,291
until the pigeons
start arriving back home.

120
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,125
- You get a message saying,
"Yep, the birds were released

121
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,875
from, let's say, Ames, Iowa,
at 7 a.m."

122
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,999
And then, you sit in the silence
in the yard

123
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:08,999
and wait for birds to land
on Saturday morning.

124
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:09,999
When they come in,

125
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,083
ideally, they hear me whistle
from across the yard,

126
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,500
and they land immediately

127
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,959
and go in to eat.

128
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,291
[pigeons cooing,
Liz whistling]

129
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,083
We whistle
every time they're fed

130
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,625
from the time they're born.

131
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,291
Come on, baby.

132
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,000
Young birds,
food is their motivation.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,333
They're coming home
for food.

134
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,792
- The science behind
how the pigeons

135
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,333
actually navigate
their way home

136
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,999
remains a mystery.

137
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,000
- Liz: It's magic.

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,999
The scientists still--
to this day-- don't know.

139
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,333
- A lot of people say
they use the sun.

140
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,917
A lot of people say
landmarks

141
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,792
and maybe
it's a little bit of both.

142
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:42,542
During pigeon racing,

143
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,291
you're just releasing them
up in the sky

144
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,667
and praying
that they come back.

145
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,709
- When they return home,

146
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:51,917
a sensor records the time
each bird enters the loft.

147
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:54,875
- We're always looking to see
whose bird comes home first.

148
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,709
- On race day,
it's kind of exciting

149
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,291
to figure out
where you sit.

150
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,458
- Garrett: I guess we get
pretty competitive some days.

151
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,999
I believe I won
my first race in...

152
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:06,250
gosh, I don't know
what year it was,
but I was pretty young.

153
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,333
- Garrett was on a streak
at one point

154
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,250
where he had beat me
in every race

155
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,208
for 16 straight races.

156
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,999
So, that needed to
come to an end really quickly.

157
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,542
[laughs]

158
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,999
- Through the years,
the birds got better.

159
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,125
- They double in size
every day.

160
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,709
By 30 days,
they're fully grown.

161
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,875
- The bond between mom and son
grew stronger.

162
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,667
- We spent a lot
of invaluable time together,

163
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,583
the two of us, with these birds
over the years.

164
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,500
- And the need for Garrett

165
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,375
to spread his wings

166
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,417
took flight.

167
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,792
- I think I'll miss race day
the most.

168
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,709
Sitting out on the porch

169
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,083
and just waiting for the birds
to fly over.

170
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,667
- Garrett is heading off
to school,

171
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,500
leaving Mom
to fly solo.

172
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,417
- A lot of the guys
at the club

173
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,333
have kind of kidded me
about that,

174
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,041
how I lost
all my good help

175
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,667
and all my...
all my magic.

176
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,999
To me, it's very interesting.
[laughs]

177
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,999
They're just amazing animals.

178
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,125
I'm talking to
the other guys in the club

179
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,999
to see if I won or lost.
[laughs]

180
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:06,333
I love it!

181
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,999
[pigeons chirping]

182
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,166
[shimmery music]

183
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,834
- Next up, we meet
a Sheboygan collector

184
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,792
with a
treasure trove fit

185
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,250
for the
silver screen.

186
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,792
[traffic]

187
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,917
[background conversations,
playful music]

188
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,208
- At an afternoon matinée
in Sheboygan,

189
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,000
you'll find moviegoers seeking
thrills on the silver screen.

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,917
[neon light sizzles]

191
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,125
- Mike Miller:
There's some movies
where it's like,

192
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:30,999
you know, pack them in.

193
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,792
It's a group experience.
[chorus of laughter]

194
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,834
But there is something to be
said about a small theater,

195
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,291
and it's just you.

196
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,999
Me and this movie
that I'm watching,

197
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,083
it's like
there is a connection.

198
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,208
[film projector clicks, buzzes]
- Before the credits roll,

199
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,999
Mike Miller knows
he'll be back here again.

200
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,625
- Mike: The first time
that I see the movie,
I know I miss so much.

201
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,999
I was easily
on the 15th time,

202
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,000
and I caught somebody
doing something on the screen.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,166
So, I really<i>didn't
</i>see the whole movie yet.

204
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,417
- For Mike,
just one set of films

205
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,667
inspired his own
real-life passion.

206
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:09,542
- Mike: I couldn't fathom
what it would feel like

207
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,166
the first time a stranger
came up to me

208
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,709
and been like, "Hey,
are you that Indiana Jones guy?"

209
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,125
Well, that was really neat.

210
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,875
That was pretty cool.
Yeah.

211
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,999
["Indiana Jones" style music]

212
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,875
[horse galloping, gunshot]

213
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,083
[whip, swords clanging]

214
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,250
- Mike has his own
temple of treasures

215
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,291
dedicated to Harrison Ford and
the globetrotting archaeologist.

216
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,999
- Mike: When people ask me,
"What do you collect?"

217
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,750
I collect
Indiana Jones memorabilia.

218
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,542
"Well, what exactly?"

219
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,999
Everything.

220
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,750
There's usually three reactions.

221
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,999
[cash register]
"How much money
is in this room?"

222
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,999
[arcade game]
"How many items
are in this room?"

223
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:51,999
[clock ticking]
"And how long did it take you
to create this room?"

224
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,250
I have
absolutely no idea.

225
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,917
- From books and banners

226
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,333
to movie props
and pinball machines,

227
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,583
[pinball machine pulses]

228
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,583
this collection has
sent Mike and his wife, Martha,

229
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,041
on their own expeditions.

230
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,999
- Martha Miller:
He's definitely taken
me along on the adventure.

231
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:13,166
I mean, there's pieces
I know I've never even seen.

232
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,792
But then,
there's other pieces where,

233
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,625
"Oh, I remember
going to get that piece."

234
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,000
- This standee
is from Applebee's.

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,583
And in here actually,
on the computer,

236
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,999
and all of a sudden, I hear,
"Applebee's, or whatever,

237
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:25,999
go see the new Indiana Jones!"

238
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,999
[makes startled sound]
I fell out of my chair almost,
running.

239
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,500
What, what, what, what?!?

240
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,999
They all complement each other.

241
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,999
It's one collection.

242
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:40,000
- Like his onscreen hero,
Mike has his own origin tale.

243
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,083
It started at a family gathering
with his dad.

244
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:49,083
- I heard him laugh like I had
never heard him laugh before.
[burst of laughter]

245
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,709
He was actually watching
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

246
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,999
But once I found out what
that movie was and everything,

247
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:55,792
who the actor was,

248
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,999
again, it just
started coming all together.

249
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:01,667
- His parents bought him
an Indiana Jones video cassette

250
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,000
that sparked his curiosity,

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,625
and then,
the rest was history.

252
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,999
- That might
have actually been

253
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,625
when the collector
was born in me.

254
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,834
And I just didn't
know it yet.

255
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:15,834
I became more conscious
of wanting to surround myself

256
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,166
with those movies.

257
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:21,834
- The magic of these movies
quickly connected with Mike.

258
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,999
- Mike:
The humor, the adventure,

259
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:28,417
and how it seemed
to kind of relate to my life,

260
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:31,375
things that
I was missing in my life.

261
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:35,041
- Several years
after Indy's<i>Last Crusade,</i>

262
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,834
Mike was ready
for the surprising twist

263
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,583
at the box office--

264
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,667
two film sequels.

265
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:45,709
- Mike:<i>Crystal Skull
</i> was the first movie

266
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,458
I actually saw
with both my parents.

267
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,583
I got to hear my dad
laugh again

268
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,959
like he did
when he was watching<i>Raiders</i>.

269
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,959
Every time I watch the movie,
when a certain scene comes up,

270
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,583
it's always gonna be
about that laugh.

271
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,208
[warm synthesizer]

272
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:10,125
- More films brought
more memories and memorabilia

273
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,999
and less house space.

274
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,375
- Martha:
When we got our wedding picture
framed, well, of course,

275
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,999
it's going to go
above the fireplace.

276
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:20,667
And then, there's
a fourth movie coming out.

277
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,250
Well, that means
more collecting.

278
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,417
- Mike: I get this standee
one day in the mail.

279
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,041
So, I started looking
around the house,

280
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,999
trying to figure
out a spot where it can go.

281
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:31,875
Couldn't figure it out.

282
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,792
Sat down on the couch,
was watching a little TV,

283
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:38,792
and all of a sudden,
my eyes just kind of went over
to the fireplace.

284
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,999
I just got to see
what it looks like.

285
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,999
Took down
the wedding picture,

286
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,999
put up the standee
on top of the fireplace.

287
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:51,333
- From then on,
I was basically staring at
the<i>Crystal Skull</i>movie poster--

288
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,291
only on a huge, huge scale.

289
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,458
So, I always
have to give him a hard time

290
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,625
'cuz that's
just my way of saying,

291
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,625
"Hey, honey, I love you."

292
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,959
- As the collection grew...

293
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,999
[clattering,
pulling tape off a roller]

294
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,375
they agreed
it was time for a new home,

295
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,125
[jackhammer,
drill whirring]

296
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,999
including his specially built
room you see today--

297
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,792
packed with nostalgia.

298
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:21,125
- Martha: It's like,
"No, I don't want my home
to be my museum;

299
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,542
I want my museum
to be in my home."

300
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,375
I was excited 'cuz
it was just another adventure.

301
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,999
- Mike can't point to
a favorite Indiana Jones piece,

302
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,625
but there are a few
he considers absolute gems.

303
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,999
- Mike: That is a signed photo
from Harrison Ford.

304
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,834
I don't display it yet because
it's almost like I'm waiting.

305
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:46,041
Once I meet him,
then I'll put it up.

306
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,999
There's a banner
that's hanging up in my room

307
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,000
that my dad and I got
to go get together.

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,917
And the wedding ring.

309
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,999
She's like, "Well,
what kind of ring do you want?"

310
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,625
I'm like,
"Just get me a simple band...

311
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,500
that says 'Indy' on it."

312
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,667
- For Martha,
it's a reminder

313
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,999
that she's along
for the ride, too.

314
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,500
- I enjoy it
just as much as he does.

315
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,041
Well, not just as much
as he does, but...

316
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,375
I do enjoy it.

317
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,999
It's gotten me
to do a couple of things

318
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,375
that I never would
have otherwise ever done.

319
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,917
Got us to get to go to
Disney World, Disneyland.

320
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:22,583
- I can't even fathom some of
the things that I would have

321
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,041
gotten through
if it wasn't for her.

322
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:25,999
The bobblehead?

323
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,291
That was
at my first Brewer game.

324
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,999
They had
an Indiana Jones Day.

325
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,999
She put it all together,
made all the arrangements.

326
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:41,999
- In the past, Mike debated
whether to continue this quest.

327
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,999
But now, he's certain
about his future.

328
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,208
- Mike: I'm an
Indiana Jones collector.

329
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,625
The movies may be over,

330
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,999
but there'll always be
stuff to collect.

331
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,999
I don't really know if I would
pitch these movies to anybody.

332
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:56,583
They're my thing.

333
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,625
They'll always be my thing
till the very end.

334
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,542
My hope for everybody
would be:

335
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,959
get out there,
watch the movies,

336
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,999
and see if you can make that
magical connection like I did.

337
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:14,375
[triumphant<i>Indiana Jones</i>theme]

338
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,000
[shimmery music]

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,917
- I'm having a blast
at Circus World

340
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:21,208
while trapezing through the
historic treasures found here.

341
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,250
[whistle blowing]

342
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,375
- Ringleader:
Welcome to Circus World!

343
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,917
[circus music]

344
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,750
- Come one, come all

345
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,083
to enjoy camels,

346
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:34,834
clowns,

347
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:38,000
and a human cannonball
[cannon pops]

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
here at Circus World.

349
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,750
To learn a bit more
about the history here,

350
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,750
I met up with Scott O'Donnell,

351
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,542
who wasn't
clowning around...

352
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,041
just yet.

353
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,999
- Scott O'Donnell: So, we opened
July 1st, 1959, to celebrate

354
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,999
the state of Wisconsin's
vibrant circus heritage.

355
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:57,000
We're here in Baraboo
because it was the hometown

356
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,999
of the Ringling Bros.,

357
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,834
who started their circus here
in 1884,

358
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,917
and their personal attorney,

359
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,709
John M. Kelly,
at the tender age of 93,

360
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,542
decided that this state

361
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:09,999
needed to celebrate
its vibrant circus heritage.

362
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:10,959
- So, would you say Wisconsin

363
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,333
has been the lead contributor,
historically,

364
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,041
to circuses around the nation?
- Without a doubt!

365
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,834
It's been the incubator
and the cultural epicenter

366
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,083
for this art form
that has been around

367
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,709
as part
of the American experience

368
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,041
longer than Coca-Cola,
the Kentucky Derby,

369
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:24,999
and baseball
in America.

370
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,792
Really, if you take the map,
and you throw a dart at it,

371
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,834
you're gonna get on it
really close to a town

372
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,166
where a circus came from
in this great state.

373
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,999
- So, connect us
to what that means

374
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:34,999
when we come
to Circus World.

375
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,000
Like, what should I expect
to experience?

376
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,458
- Scott O'Donnell:
Well, 64 acres
of a living history museum.

377
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,125
<i>The Big Top Show
</i> is our signature piece,

378
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:43,917
where you get to sit

379
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,917
under a big, billowing,
red and white big top tent,

380
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,166
as people have done
for generations in America,

381
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
and it's filled to the gills
with talent.

382
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,250
We have singing ringmasters
and funny clowns.

383
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,709
We have daring aerialists
which are 40 feet up in the air.

384
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,999
We have jugglers and acrobats
and contortionists,

385
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,792
and some amazing animal partners
with us, as well.

386
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,375
But there's
six other performances

387
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,375
outside of the<i>Big Top Show,</i>

388
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,000
plus seven buildings
to explore,

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,375
filled to the gills
with the largest collection

390
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,333
of circus artifacts and ephemera
in the entire world.

391
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,250
So there's lots to do,
whether you're three to 103.

392
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,375
You got a full day
here at Circus World.

393
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,792
- A full day traveling
through what is known

394
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,542
as "the greatest show on earth,"

395
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,999
all while learning about
Wisconsin's rich circus history.

396
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:37,750
We continue our parade
through Circus World

397
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,875
here in Baraboo

398
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:39,999
as we join an artist

399
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,166
working to restore
the wagons found here.

400
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,959
[relaxed acoustic music]

401
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,999
Visit Sauk County,
and there's a good chance

402
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:54,041
of coming across artwork
by Joan Stevens.

403
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,999
- I did a sign
for the Baraboo-Dells Airport.

404
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,667
I love driving by
that sign.

405
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,125
Roy's Classic Cars.

406
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,083
It looks like
a 1950s Shell station,

407
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:08,999
and did some pinstriping on
a couple of features in there.

408
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:11,208
There's an airplane hangar
in the corner.

409
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,375
I had to put the lettering
up on top of it

410
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,999
that said "Luther Field,"
which was really cool.

411
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:20,750
- And in downtown Baraboo,
home of the Circus Parade...

412
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,041
- I painted a 15-foot
wagon wheel on the pavement

413
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,125
in front of
the AL. Ringling Theater.

414
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,250
It's held up pretty good.

415
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,291
- Circus art
is Joan's specialty,

416
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,583
where her
precision brushwork

417
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,291
is helping restore and preserve
the past.

418
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,667
- I am passionate
about what I do.

419
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,999
I say that I specialize
in restoration

420
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:45,959
because I use
the old trade skills

421
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,208
that I've learned
over the years--

422
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:51,250
still hand painting
and antiquing and gold gilding.

423
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,250
A good day is when

424
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,834
I can stay
in my grubby blue jeans

425
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:59,999
and come out to the shop
and sling some paint.
[laughs]

426
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,792
I have to smell turpentine
and have paint on my hands

427
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,291
pretty much every day.

428
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,792
Otherwise, it feels like
something's missing.

429
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,458
- She also had
a brush with fame,

430
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,583
restoring wagons that appeared
in the 2011 award-winning movie

431
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,208
<i>Water for Elephants.</i>

432
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,250
- I was able to do
the Sells Floto Ticket Wagon

433
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,667
down at Circus World,
#62.

434
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:26,500
- Joan's personal storyline
mirrors the movie

435
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,875
as she found herself
seeking adventure.

436
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,625
- I kind of ran away
with the carnival.

437
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,917
It sounds good
when you say it that way,

438
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:34,792
but I took a job.

439
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,542
I took off
with a bag of clothes

440
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,333
and enough money
to get back home.

441
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,959
I was surrounded by
hand-painted signs and images,

442
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,041
and the rides were still
hand-painted at that time.

443
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:50,166
And it just kind of was an
immediate connection that I had.

444
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,500
- Joan ran away
in search of her dreams

445
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,583
and then discovered them

446
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,291
right in her hometown
of Baraboo.

447
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,250
- When I came home,

448
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,999
I was determined
to continue to paint signs.

449
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:05,875
And Circus World
seemed like a pretty good fit.

450
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:11,083
And I've been there ever since,
which is, I think 37 years if...

451
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,208
But who's counting?
[laughs]

452
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,999
- Joan is currently
putting the finishing touches

453
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:20,375
on a wagon
for Circus World.

454
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:20,999
- Ta-da!

455
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:25,917
We're gonna go down
to the wagon shop,

456
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:30,999
get to come in,
and start decorating.

457
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,583
- So, these are the skyboards
off of #44,

458
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,000
Gollmar Lion and Tiger Tableau.

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,999
It was a cage wagon
turned into a baggage wagon,

460
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,041
and then they used it
in parades.

461
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,250
- When they started
to restore the wagon,

462
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,834
took the old panels off

463
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,208
and uncovered
these beautiful paintings.

464
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:55,500
And I'm reproducing them
to put back on the wagon.

465
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,999
I love to see
the finished project.

466
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:02,083
- On any given day,
in the winter storage

467
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,959
barn at Circus World...

468
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,542
