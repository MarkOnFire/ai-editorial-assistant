[strumming acoustic guitar]

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,839
- Angela Fitzgerald:
This Dutch-style windmill

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,976
is an icon of pop culture
in the Northwoods.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,145
- Pat Berg:
It is a landmark for sure.

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,116
The history of the building
is fantastic.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,752
We hear
a lot of stories.

7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:23,257
- Russell Berg: It was part of
Phil's Resort on Lake Nokomis.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,659
The building goes back
to 1939,

9
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,463
and it was originally built
as a Sinclair gas station.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,999
- Russell Berg
is the family historian.

11
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,768
- Russell: Over the years,
it's been a candy shop.

12
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,937
There was
an information booth,

13
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,406
and sometime
in the mid to late 70s,

14
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,774
it became
an ice cream shop,

15
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,976
and it has been
ever since.

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,980
- The Berg family built its
own history with the Windmill

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,616
and can serve up stories
and ice cream

18
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,185
all in one scoop.

19
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,587
- Russell: In 1993,
my parents bought it,

20
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,788
Pat and Charlie Berg.

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,523
Mom was getting close
to retirement

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,293
as a fourth-grade teacher
down in Athens, Wisconsin.

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,329
- Pat Berg: And I said
going past here,

24
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,132
"Someday,
we're going to own this."

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,935
Never giving it
another thought at all.

26
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,803
Can I help you, sir?

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,406
[twangy country guitar]

28
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,613
Pat: When we bought it, I said,
"We're buying it for the kids

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,615
and for
the young at heart."

30
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,617
Oh, here comes the kids.

31
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,686
[fun, swinging jazz]

32
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,991
- Ice cream is what put this
tourist attraction on the map.

33
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,726
[bouncy jazz]

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,662
- Russ: We like to think
we're at the intersection

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,566
of Wisconsin's dairy industry
and tourism industry,

36
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,768
offering the best
of what

37
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,171
the state of Wisconsin
has to offer.

38
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,874
- Customer: Thank you so much.

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,976
- For more than 32 years,

40
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:53,013
the Bergs have hand-scooped,
served, and created smiles.

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,750
- Rodney Berg:
The biggest surprise for me was

42
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,820
just how happy
it makes people feel.

43
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,456
No one ever comes into
an ice cream shop crying.

44
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,625
- Pat: Hello, come on in.

45
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,959
Don't be shy.

46
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:09,162
And I love when
they come in as a family,

47
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,998
and all the kids are smiling

48
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,501
and looking already
what they're going to order.

49
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,436
- Child: I'm going to, ahh...
- Adult: Okay.

50
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,372
- Pat: Even the little babies,
I always say,

51
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,274
"Oh, Baby came for a treat."

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,075
- Russ Berg:
It's become a tradition.

53
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,913
People reminiscing to where
their grandparents brought 'em,

54
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,149
and now they're bringing
their kids or their grandkids.

55
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,586
[lively swing music]
- Mother: All right, guys.

56
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,321
Smile!
- So fun!

57
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,191
- For several generations,

58
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,361
the Windmill has also become
a Berg family tradition.

59
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,698
- Rodney: Spending 30 years
working alongside my mom,

60
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,134
seeing how it grew
throughout all those years.

61
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,536
- Pat: Two scoops on that?

62
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,039
Chocolate on top,
hot fudge.

63
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,409
- Rodney: And then, as I
got married and had children,

64
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,512
when they got old enough, I was
working alongside them, too.

65
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,882
- Meagan Berg: I grew up here,
so it's a special place for me.

66
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,350
Meagan:
When I was really little,

67
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,419
I would come and help clean up
in the morning.

68
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,820
And then,
when I was old enough,

69
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,857
I started
scooping ice cream.

70
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,391
I got to hang out
with her

71
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,627
and I became super close
with her.

72
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,996
Just watching her
own her business

73
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,832
inspired me
to just follow my dreams.

74
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:22,903
- Customer: I'm gonna get
a single scoop in a bowl.

75
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,838
- I have very good
grandchildren,

76
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,708
and they're very helpful,
and they're very good.

77
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,042
They learn fast.

78
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,679
- Angela: With more than
100 flavors in rotation,

79
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,282
there's always
a favorite in store.

80
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,385
- Russ: You always have to have
vanilla, chocolate, strawberry.

81
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,854
- Teen: Here's strawberry.

82
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:45,692
- Russ:
Okay, we have a blueberry
cheesecake to go in next,

83
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,761
along with bubble gum

84
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,830
and cake and ice cream.

85
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,565
Okay?
- Pat: Yep.

86
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,170
- Flavor after flavor,
year after year,

87
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,172
the Windmill
made a name for itself.

88
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,806
- Child: Yay!
- Adult: The birthday cake.

89
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,476
- If it's a holiday, it's lines
out the door all day long.

90
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,878
[sentimental acoustic]

91
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,782
July 4th is
our Super Bowl week or weekend.

92
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,984
It's the biggest holiday
here in the Northwoods.

93
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,254
- Pat: Oh, we're gonna
need a new one.

94
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,557
- Russ: There are times
where we will go through

95
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,959
70 to 80 tubs of ice cream.

96
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,763
- Meagan: You get to see all
these people coming in on boats,

97
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,598
[boat blows horn]

98
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,500
you know,
enjoying their summer.

99
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,569
- Family in unison: Bye!

100
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,671
- Meagan: You get to see people,

101
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,039
you know,
connect with one another

102
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,807
and have a smile
on their face.

103
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,945
- Pat: Sometimes, I think,
"Wow, this is fabulous!

104
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,814
"The lines of people
that come

105
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,218
and good people,
nice people."

106
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,485
- You want
the chocolate one,

107
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,222
or do you want the one
with chocolate chunks?

108
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,325
- I love the Windmill,
and I always did.

109
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,828
- Place... I have
so many memories here,
like countless. [laughs]

110
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,198
So, it's just
a special place for me.

111
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,067
A million funny stories.

112
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,136
- Charlie: It's kind of humbling
to have so many people come

113
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,940
and love and comment
on their experiences here.

114
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,177
The biggest compliment we can
get is when a family says,

115
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,311
"We'll be back tomorrow."

116
