part of American pop culture.

- Rachel Ristow:
It's been around forever.

00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,549
It's like this big,
gigantic puzzle of chaos,

but it's fun.

has had its ups and downs.

Seeing a resurgence
in the hobby is great.

because you have to focus
on flipping your buttons

00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,924
there were no games
basically in Sheboygan County,

- It was a good game.

26
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,202
I missed my extra ball.

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,072
One ball to win 'em all.

- All right,
now I'm done. [laughing]

39
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,737
- The pinball community is

It's made up of all sorts of
people from all walks of life.

is the Diamond Plate Arcade.

It's a unique private collection
near De Pere.

44
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,517
Pinball is also a place

for these women to connect,
converse, and compete.

- Yeah, whoo!

49
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,600
Women's pinball creates
a safe space for women

50
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,669
in the hobby
so that they can learn

51
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,738
and so that they can feel
supported.

52
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,874
I've been able to meet
so many new people in my life.

53
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,943
A lot of folks,
I think, struggle with,

where do you meet new friends at
different stages in your life?

I'm in my 40s.

I don't have children,
I'm divorced.

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,585
Women's pinball is

- Rachel: I love to think about
pinball as controlling chaos

67
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,274
when you're able to find
the skills to control the ball.

- Player: No, no.
- Group: Yay!

- Rachel: That's what
I'm talking about.

70
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,282
You're able to score
and have a bigger game

71
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,084
and more points,
and you can win the game.

72

- Angela: Winning isn't
everything, but for Rachel,

it is a close second.

until I met pinball.

Get in there,
you little jerkface.

77
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,063
I played a couple of women's
world championships.

78
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,165
My current open women's
world ranking,

79
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,701
I think, is 25th overall
in the world.

I ended last year at 13th.

00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:28,275
I think that,
in Ladies Flip Wisconsin,

82
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,711
we have some
very competitive players

83
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,113
and other players
that don't care at all.

- Angela: This magical box
with flashing lights

85
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,385
is more than a game for Rachel.

86
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,987
- Rachel: Because you get
into this hobby

87
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,023
and then you meet people
that just become your friends,

88
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,326
and it becomes more
than just pinball.

89
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,328
It gives me the feeling
of, like,

90
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,132
I have always a woman
in my corner looking out for me.

91
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,567
It makes me happy.
