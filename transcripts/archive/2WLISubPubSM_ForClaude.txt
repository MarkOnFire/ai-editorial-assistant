[seagulls squawking]

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,538
At the Wisconsin Maritime
Museum in Manitowoc,

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,940
a tour of
its World War II submarine

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,542
is a peak experience.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,513
- Kevin Cullen: An engineering
marvel, diesel and electric.

6
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,914
- Painstakingly restored,

7
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,116
the sub looks and feels

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,619
much as it would have
when on patrol

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,722
in the war-torn waters
of the Pacific.

10
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,891
For the museum's
executive director,

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,859
the ship represents
many things.

12
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,695
- Kevin Cullen:
Behind me here is <i>USS Cobia,</i>

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,999
a national landmark
from World War II.

14
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,202
It's a testament
to the service and sacrifice

15
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,804
that the submariners
endured.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,007
And, of course, the legacy
of building submarines

17
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,141
in Manitowoc.

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,476
Twenty-eight subs
launched here

19
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,446
and <i>Cobia</i> kind of has
a sentinel of that heritage.

20
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:50,184
- For Manitowoc native
and Navy veteran, Jeff Tess,

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,554
boarding the <i>Cobia</i>
means something else.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,322
- Jeff Tess: This is home.

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,424
This is where
I felt comfortable.

24
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:01,795
Life on a submarine
is the most peaceful existence

25
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,630
you've ever had
in your life.

26
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,934
American submarines
are the best,

27
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,436
so you don't worry
about much.

28
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,573
Do your job, and you don't
worry about anything else.

29
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,209
- The <i>Cobia</i> was already
a museum piece

30
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,812
by the time Jeff joined
the US Navy's submarine service.

31
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,982
But for him,
it's not so different

32
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,485
from the advanced nuclear
submarine he called home.

33
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,955
- Oh, yeah,
not much different.

34
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,790
I was a cook;
that was my job.

35
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,124
We have
our coffee machine here.

36
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,159
We have
a flat-top griddle.

37
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,527
We have an oven.

38
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,996
- The job
was a vital one.

39
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,532
- If you can't cook
or you're not good,

40
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,633
you don't last
very long.

41
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,801
And that's
a true statement.

42
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,035
I believe
that the cooks

43
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,204
are the most important person
on the boat

44
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,107
because there's nothing else
to take your mind off of life

45
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,842
except the food.

46
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,678
[food sizzling,
utensils clinking]

47
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,280
[conversations in background]

48
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,884
- Jeff Tess: Food is something
that brings the world together.

49
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,119
So, on a submarine,
that's the same thing.

50
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,989
It's the one time
where the crew gets together,

51
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,791
shares a meal,
talks, laughs, has fun.

52
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,360
You made cookies
or sticky buns.

53
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,762
You've made those,
you had a lot of friends.

54
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,131
- Jeff is still
making friends

55
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,834
and bringing people together
around food.

56
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,737
- Jeff: What can I do to you?
[laughing]

57
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,738
- In Two Rivers,

58
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,207
just up the road
from the <i>USS Cobia,</i>

59
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,143
overlooking the open waters
of Lake Michigan,

60
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,413
Jeff opened
Submariner's Pub in 2022.

61
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,717
- Jeff: My job is to serve
good food and nice cold beers

62
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,353
so that everybody
can enjoy themselves.

63
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,522
- Just like his job
in the Navy,

64
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,358
Jeff's work
serves a higher purpose.

65
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,862
Here, he honors
the service of others.

66
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,631
- Jeff: This is my homage
to the veterans that

67
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:48,569
provide the safety and security
and the freedom we have.

68
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,271
- Like the cramped confines
of a submarine,

69
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,808
every nook and cranny
of the pub serves its purpose.

70
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,846
- Jeff: There's hats, there's
a bunch of memorabilia around,

71
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,447
and there's pictures
on the wall.

72
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,618
I have 12 pictures of my family
up there that all served.

73
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,987
I have an Uncle Gordy
who jumped in on D-Day,

74
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,524
his Purple Heart and
his Bronze Star are over there.

75
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,327
And anybody can bring
a family member, themselves,

76
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,294
whatever in.

77
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,363
I call it
my Hero Wall.

78
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,100
It's a tribute to
the people that made us great.

79
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,504
- Those tributes are
not just for the distant past.

80
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,939
Submariner's Pub
has quickly become

81
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,742
a second home
for area veterans.

82
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,212
One vet with her picture
on the wall is Ashley Smits,

83
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,215
head of the organization
Manitowoc County Vets.

84
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,018
- Ashley Smits:
A lot of veterans, when
they get out of the military,

85
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,720
they feel isolated,
they feel alone.

86
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,824
To have Submariner's Pub
is a place that you can connect

87
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,560
that just brings
that camaraderie together,

88
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,729
and a place where you can

89
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,064
feel understood
and seen and heard again.

90
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,168
- One of the things
that I was missing as a veteran

91
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,537
was a place
to come talk to people

92
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,407
that are like-minded
and get through it.

93
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,611
- Where Jeff cooks today

94
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,315
is laid out almost exactly
like the submarine's galley,

95
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,552
and the satisfaction he takes
is the same.

96
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,187
- Jeff: It's a part of my heart.

97
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,989
When I cook your meal,
and you eat it,

98
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,091
and I see the smile
on your face,

99
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,327
and you're telling me
how good it was,

100
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,696
it's what I need
for my feedback.

101
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,232
Your smile
makes me happy.

102
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,335
Feeding the world
is a cool thing,

103
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,270
and making people happy,
there's nothing better.

104
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,005
There's really
nothing better.

105
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,075
