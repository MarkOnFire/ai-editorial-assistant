[playful guitar picking]

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,834
- Angela Fitzgerald:
Nothing excites teenager
Max Gabb more than airplanes.

4
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,709
- Yeah, coming in next...

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,417
from La Guardia.

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,875
- Max is all about

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:24,709
tracking, identifying,
and photographing planes.

8
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,583
- Max: Oh, and there's
the Chicago plane.

9
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,542
Everything's coming
at once.

10
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:30,250
[camera shutter clicking]

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,625
There's a bunch of spots
around the airport to do it,

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,834
and anyone
can do it.

13
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:36,667
[shutter clicking]

14
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,500
- His hobby is called
"plane spotting."

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,041
- Max: Departures on one runway
and arrivals on the other.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,458
[camera clicks]

17
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,999
All right.

18
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,417
I started doing this
during COVID

19
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,959
as a goal to bike.

20
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:58,999
[upbeat synthesizer]

21
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,875
Every morning, I look
on the flight radar.

22
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,041
If there's something
coming in,

23
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,458
I'll get
my camera equipment

24
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,667
and bike over
and spot it.

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,542
- Jamie Gabb:
He needed something
to get out of the house.

26
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:10,875
I mean,
you couldn't do much.

27
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,834
Biking was
a good thing to do.

28
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,208
And he's, "I'm going out
to the airport."

29
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,125
[Max pedaling]

[music, birds chirping]

31
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:21,999
- On this day, Max takes
his dad, Jamie, along.

32
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,709
- Dad, it's up here.

33
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,333
- To a favorite perch

34
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,083
near Milwaukee's
Mitchell International Airport.

35
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,999
- Jamie: I like this spot
a lot.

36
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,875
- Max: Yeah, it's really nice.

37
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,917
[airplane engine noise]

38
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,583
- Max: Ooh!

39
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,917
There's a C-130 coming in.

40
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:40,792
Wow!

41
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:43,500
- While the C-130
is still off in the distance,

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,667
Max has his sights set
on another unique aircraft.

43
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:50,750
- Max: This is the one
that I'm really, I'm here for.

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,291
- There's only one plane like it
in the world.

45
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,500
- Yeah, Colorado One's next.

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,417
It's currently
about to cross the state line.

47
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,166
Nope, it is in Wisconsin.

48
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,583
There's a lot of planes
in the world,

49
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:08,500
and a lot of them are rare
for Milwaukee's airport here.

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,375
When the rare ones
come in,

51
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,083
that's when it's really fun
to get the planes.

52
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,709
[airplane engine,
wheels on tarmac]

53
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,999
Max: It's about to go
on final.

54
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,625
No more turns;
it's straight for the runway,

55
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,583
lined up,
and ready to land.

56
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,291
[camera shutter clicks]

57
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:28,583
It's special, painted
as the state flag of Colorado.

58
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:29,750
I really like
that one.

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,875
That's probably one
of the better ones they have.

60
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,999
- With Colorado One
on the ground...

61
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,834
- I'm gonna look at the schedule
and see...

62
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:40,125
- Max gets another hit
on a plane incoming.

63
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,959
- Max: And then, this is
a United plane that's coming in

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,750
to take the Orioles
back to Baltimore.

65
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,417
They are playing right now,
the Brewers are.

66
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,000
[shutter clicks twice]

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,458
- In just a few years...

68
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,999
- Max: This is a Delta A321
from Atlanta.

69
00:02:55,999 --> 00:03:00,834
- Max has already spotted
more than a thousand aircraft.

70
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:03,000
[shutter clicking]

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,417
- The best spotting experiences
I've had

72
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,959
is probably Air Force One,

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,999
back on Labor Day when
the president came to Milwaukee.

74
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:13,999
Another experience,

75
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:18,333
there were four
McDonnell Douglas Harriers,

76
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,125
very rare.

77
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,250
They didn't do
the vertical takeoff or landing,

78
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,333
but still,
it was really awesome to see.

79
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,667
[jet engine roaring]

80
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,792
- To see Max
so excited,

81
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:29,959
it might surprise you

82
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,999
that his fascination
started from

83
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:34,542
the fear of flying.

84
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,333
- I was afraid of planes,
originally.

85
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,250
- Jamie: There were times

86
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,750
where it was not always fun
to sit next to Max.

87
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,083
He just did not like
the turbulence.

88
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,999
So, he started to calm down
and he did his research.

89
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,375
- Max: Let's flip it.

90
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,999
Literally,
all of it opposite.

91
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,999
I kind of like
light turbulence now.

92
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,417
It gives for
an interesting ride.

93
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,667
- Good thing Max
<i>now</i>enjoys air travel

94
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,625
because his plane spotting
has expanded

95
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,250
well beyond
Wisconsin's borders.

96
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,750
[camera clicking]

97
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,999
- I've gone to
Fort Lauderdale, Orlando,

98
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,417
Vegas and Utah and Denver.

99
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,583
And in St. Martin,

100
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,583
the airport
with the beach,

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,583
where the planes are

102
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,583
a few feet
above the beach goers.

103
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,750
It looks really cool.

104
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,208
[loud engine overhead]

105
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,834
- Max also makes it easy

106
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,291
to track his aviation
adventures.

107
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,999
- Max: I like to edit videos
and do media for planes.

108
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,500
Post it to my Instagram
and YouTube later.

109
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,083
[airplane accelerates]

110
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,875
- It was definitely
a successful trip,
[zipping bag]

111
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:47,583
even though the C-130
didn't end up landing here.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,083
- As a young boy,
Max faced his fear,

113
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,333
and now,
he has sky-high dreams.

114
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,625
- Yeah.
[laughs]

115
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,875
I've wanted to be
an airline pilot

116
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,834
when I knew all the things
that I know about planes.

117
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,917
- That would
guarantee Max

118
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:09,083
the best seat
for plane spotting...

119
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,750
[camera shutter clicks]

120
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,333
turbulence and all.

121
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,458
- Jamie Gabb: It's nice to see
that he is a self-starter

122
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,333
and can focus
on what he really enjoys.

123
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:27,458
Be it his schoolwork or his
plane spotting, for sure, yeah.

124
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,999
[sunny, lighthearted vocals]
