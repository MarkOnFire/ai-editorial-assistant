Anja Notanja Sieger.

00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,750
- Anja Notanja Sieger:
Listening.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,999
Writing is listening,
if you do it well.

[Angela clears throat,

11

Good writing
is all about listening.

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,750
- Anja: Listening not only
for what they need to hear,

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,041
but also just listening
to what they're saying.

14
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,999
- Angela: It's about zeroing in

15
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,999
and reflecting on
what's around you.

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,625
Introducing Anja.

26
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:10,291
She's been writing stories
since she could draw.

27
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:14,792
- I've always was just
one of those kids that...

28
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,875
would draw a picture,

29
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,041
and the picture
would have a story.

30
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,125
And so, even before
I could write, I'd be like,

31
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,166
"Mom, Mom,
write down this story!

32
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,083
This is,
this is what this is about."

33
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,125
And that's just
how I've always been.

34
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,417
- Later, drawing
would segue into typing,

35
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:37,000
lots of typing.

00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,917
setting up a typewriter

40
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:52,667

41
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:53,625
and charging a fee

42
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,750
to write personalized
poems or stories.

43
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,166
- Anja: I generally give people

44
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,333
a very thorough
interview process

45
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,999
where I want to know...

46
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,834
what they
need to hear right now

47
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,999
or who is it going to
and why?

48
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,667
And why does that person
make them a better person?

49
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:15,834
Or how is their dog different
from all other dogs?

50
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,999
You know, I get in there
with people.

51

- One of
her first poems

52
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,667
featured
a dash of romance

53
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,291
and a whole lot
of awkwardness.

[playful brass instruments]

55
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:37,750
- A guitar player,
who was a busker,

56
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,999
came up to me,

57
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,959
and he wanted a love poem.

58
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,083
And I think
he was hitting on me,

59
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:48,917
but I wrote him one
because I needed the money.

[typing]

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,291
- For others, a dash of romance
might shift to love.

62
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,999
- I remember this one couple;

63
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:59,917
they wanted me to write
their marriage vows.

64
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,333
So, I did.

65
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,667
And then, I put it
in an envelope.

66
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,125
And then, they're like,
"Seal it.

67
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,999
"We don't want to see it.

68
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:10,166
We want it to be a surprise
during the wedding ceremony."

69
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:14,999
And I was just like,
"Okay, all right, enjoy!

70
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,999
It'll be very entertaining."
[snickers]

71
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,750
- While entertaining,

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,291
there is pressure involved.

73
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,542
- Yeah,
no, there's no delete key.

74
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,834
But in this day and age,

75
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,375
that's magic

76
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,125
because
we have Photoshop,

77
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,917
we have
Artificial Intelligence,

78
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:36,083
but here I am

79
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:41,125
giving you
an authentic artifact.

80
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,542
Perhaps
there will be some flaws,

81
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:47,458
just like I am flawed,
and you are flawed,

82
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,709
and it's okay.

83
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:49,999
It's interesting.

84
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:53,208
- It's helping people
articulate those flaws

85
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,834
that brings Anja
the most satisfaction.

86
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,375
- I feel like
I'm doing a good thing

87
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,917
when I'm writing
for people

88
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,250
who are going through
a difficult time

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,083
or struggling
with anxiety.

90
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,917
I mean,
a lot of times,

91
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,625
I'm stepping
into a role

92
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,000
that, like,
therapists offer,

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,458
but I am an artist,
and so,

94
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:22,583
I'm giving them therapeutic
art, and that feels good.

95
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,999
- Anja, although
an expert writer,

96
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,999
has come to a somewhat
nonexpert conclusion

97
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,291
about herself.

98
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:35,208
- Anja: Every single time
I write a poem for someone

99
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,875
who's asking
for something,

100
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:41,709
there's always a chance
I'm gonna fail.

101
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:42,750
There's always a chance

102
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,417
they're not gonna like
what I write.

103
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,291
There's always a risk.

104
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,375
And I think

105
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:53,166
there's something
kind of wonderful about that

106
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,999
because I get to feel
like I'm forever...

107
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,166
an amateur.

108
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:02,542
- Or maybe she's an expert
at humility, as well.

109
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,500
- Even though I consider
myself an expert writer,

110
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,417
I also don't think
I'm done learning.

111
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:14,999
And so, in that way,
I am very much an amateur.
