Meet a Kenosha veteran tracing
his family's history of service.

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,318

[audience laughs]

00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,928
A teacher building robots
on Washington Island.

10
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,665
And the organizers
of a music festival

11
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,401
bringing music in the heart
of the Driftless.

12
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,636
- You made it!

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,037
Yeah!

14
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:40,440

[trumpet fanfare]

25

- Hello, and welcome
to <i>Wisconsin Life.</i>

26
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,385
I'm Angela Fitzgerald.

27
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,288
We are at Pritzker Military
Museum and Library,

28
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,491
a nonprofit dedicated to
preserving military history

29
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,127
in a new
state-of-the-art facility.

30
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,231
Just off I-94 in Somers
in Kenosha County,

31
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,535
the museum and research library
recently made Wisconsin its home

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,938
after 20 years
in downtown Chicago.

33
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,442
[rousing marching band music]

34
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,479
Founded in 2003
by Jennifer Pritzker,

35
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,350
a retired colonel in the
Illinois Army National Guard,

36
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,987
the museum has amassed thousands
of items in its collection,

37
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,157
all housed within this
architectural marvel.

38
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,994
The building's design was
inspired by a Higgins boat,

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,596
the amphibious WWII vehicles

40
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:13,667
that landed on the shores
of Normandy on D-Day.

41
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,404
Inside, the building's designed
with bright exposed beams

42
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,774
and floor-to-ceiling glass
designed to let light in

43
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,977
while protecting the art
from harmful UV light.

44
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,245
Creating a beautiful space

45
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,948
for visitors to participate
in programming,

46
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,950
learn about their collections,

47
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,654
or browse
through rotating exhibits.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,922
It's all part of their work

49
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,758
to "ignite a passion
for understanding

50
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,728
and preserving
our military heritage."

51
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,665
We'll dive deeper into all the
happenings at the museum

52
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:50,304
and the library, but first,
let's head out around our state.

53
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,173
We join a Kenosha veteran

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,475
who's uncovering his own
family's history

55
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,211
in the service.

56
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,250
[stately military music]

57
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,252
- Michael Hellquist: I knew
I wanted to be military

58
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,420
from a young age.

59
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,456
I served
in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

60
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,924
- Angela:
Michael Hellquist grew up

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:16,163
in a military family, along with
a sense of honor and tradition.

62
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,435
- My grandfather is probably
my biggest inspiration.

63
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,270
How's it going, Gramps?

64
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,838
- George Swenson:
Just wonderful.

65
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,174
- Michael: It actually started
with the American Legion.

66
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:31,445
I was a kid, and any time he'd
have a Legion meeting to go to,

67
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,747
a function, I'd go with.

68
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,982
- George: What?

69
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,183
- Michael: You're the
longest-serving legionnaire

70
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,886
in the state of Wisconsin.
- You're kidding.

71
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,754
I didn't know that.

72
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,190
[gavel banging]

73
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,692
- Angela: Grandfather
and grandson

74
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,230
still share time together at the
American Legion in Kenosha.

75
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,432
- Michael: So this is probably
one of my favorite pictures

76
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,600
of my grandpa.

77
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,602
That was just
this past Army Navy game.

78
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,671
- Angela: Michael is on a
mission to piece together

79
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,574
his family's history
in the armed forces.

80
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,376
- Robert Hellquist: You know,
I got that hat.

81
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,778
- Yeah, I'd like to put it
on display at some point.

82
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,180
- Yeah.
- Angela: On this day,

83
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,916
he shares the collection
of military memorabilia

84
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,350
with his dad.

85
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,120
- Michael: Grandpa's
original dog tag from Korea.

86
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,223
Your dog tag
and then my dog tag.

87
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,926
You got my uncle, Les,
and cousin, Verle.

88
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,562
He was in Korea and Vietnam.

89
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,397
- Angela: During the pandemic,

90
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,800
Michael started tracing
his family's story.

91
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:31,438
- I think on his mother's side,
how far back he got.

92
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,576
'Cause he got back
into the 1700s.

93
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,778
- Michael: There's eight
generations of military

94
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,113
in my family
that I've been able to trace

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,984
from the Revolutionary War
until Iraq and Afghanistan.

96
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,519
- Angela: This Iraq War veteran

97
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,088
has made some
fascinating discoveries

98
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,691
that make his family unique.

99
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,960
- Every story is unbelievable.

100
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,330
James Buchanan, the 15th
president of the United States,

101
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,366
is my fourth
or fifth great-uncle.

102
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,168
He's not the greatest president
in the world,

103
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,204
considered the father
of the American Civil War,

104
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,841
but it's exciting for me to be
able to trace that lineage,

105
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,210
that I am related
to a U.S. president.

106
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,145
To my knowledge,
I have three relatives

107
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,480
that fought
in the Revolutionary War.

108
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,483
Like General Samuel Sloan
from the Massachusetts militia.

109
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,586
He was also at the
Battle of Ticonderoga.

110
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,188
He's my sixth great-grandfather,

111
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:25,792
so that is great, great, great,
great, great, great-grandfather.

112
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,127
...To England.

113
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:31,398
I'm sure we have relatives that
fought for the English.

114
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,268
I don't have links on them yet.

115
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,435
Key word is "yet."

116
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,837
I will find them.

117
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,705
- Angela: Now,
it is Grandpa George

118
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,074
who is finding inspiration
from Michael.

119
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,242
- Michael: ...My tattoo.

120
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,645
This is my grandfather's
Aunt Madeline.

121
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,982
She was a nurse in the
nurse corps for World War II.

122
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,286
- That boy has done
tremendous work

123
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,657
in getting all this stuff
together.

124
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,059
- So this is what I've been able
to come up with

125
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,962
for your dad, is his
Certificate of Military Service.

126
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,667
He served from March of 1918
until January of 1919.

127
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:11,238
- And I'm very proud of what
he's put together, y'know.

128
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:15,642
I practically raised that boy.
[voice breaks]

129
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,246
Can't help it.

130
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:25,552
I'm proud of him with what
he has turned out to be.

131
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,589
He's as good as gold.

132
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,359
So I'm very proud of you.
- I'm proud of you too, Grandpa.

133
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,627
[chuckles]

134
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,830
Well, there's nobody like him.

135
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,502
- You got that right.
[Michael laughs]

136
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,871
- Angela: One veteran
sharing his story

137
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:48,275
has resulted in nearly 1,000
new family stories.

138
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,612
- Michael: It was daunting,
but I have 997 people

139
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,947
on my ancestry family tree
right now.

140
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,282
- Yeah, it's amazing.

141
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,218
I can't believe some of the
things he's got over there.

142
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:02,022
From his grandmother's side,
his mother's side,

143
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,757
and my side.

144
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,660
Proud of you, son.
- Michael: Thank you.

145
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,395
So...
- Yeah.

146
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,132
- Angela: The quest to find
more stories continues,

147
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,902
and Michael's military pride
will be preserved

148
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,304
for generations to come.

149
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,274
- Michael: I don't know why,
what drives me.

150
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,609
I think it's my passion
because I'm a veteran,

151
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,746
my grandfather's a veteran,
my father's a veteran.

152
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,414
I'm very proud of my family.

153
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,416
What's your serial number,
Grandpa?

154
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,151
- 1392117.

155
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,887
- Michael:
It's a humbling experience,

156
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,489
it's exciting.

157
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:40,027
It's cool to just be able to say
I have all of this history

158
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,762
in my family.

159
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,398
[rousing music]

160
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,447
- Angela: Now, we're off
to explore more

161
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,450
as we ferry to Washington Island
to meet a teacher

162
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:07,988
putting their school's
STEM program on the map.

163
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,558
[whistling]

164
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,530
- Miranda Dahlke: I say
I'm from Wisconsin,

165
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,732
but then when we dig deeper,
I just have to say

166
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,836
I'm in the middle
of Lake Michigan. [laughs]

167
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,571
[upbeat music]

168
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:32,145
I'm Miranda Dahlke, and I teach
science exclusively,

169
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,048
essentially,
here on Washington Island.

170
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:39,219
As well as a STEM elective
for middle school.

171
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,821
- Tim Verboomen: There's
six miles of water

172
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:41,989
between us and the mainland,

173
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,858
and the ferry operations
just make it impossible

174
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,460
for our students to attend
school anywhere else

175
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,628
other than here.

176
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,997
- So obviously, when we look
at our data...

177
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,000
You're in the same building,
just over 60 kids

178
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,868
from 4K through 12.

179
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,805
All the kids pretty much
know each other,

180
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,342
so we like to say they end up
acting like a family.

181
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,745
And I have little visitors.

182
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,447
- I'm a little, I'm a big kid.
[Miranda laughs]

183
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,518
- Your seatbelt is stuck.
[students laugh]

184
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,524
- What I try to do with the
different programs

185
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,760
that we do and bringing in all
these different activities

186
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,229
is I try to give them
a realistic idea

187
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,898
of other careers that aren't
just owning a business

188
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,701
or being part of a family
business up here.

189
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,970
- I was the structural engineer.

190
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,338
- I was the electrical engineer.

191
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,207
- I was the mechanical engineer.

192
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,374
- Miranda: Totally awesome

193
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,976
if you wanna go run your
family's business.

194
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,311
We need that, obviously.

195
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:42,649
But my goal is to try to connect
anything that we do extra

196
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,586
or bonus or anything that
they're getting involved in,

197
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,255
if I can tie it to a career
or potential idea of, like,

198
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,124
you could do this for a living.

199
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,694
- And she's fantastic with that.

200
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,697
So whether it's SeaPerch or the
Samsung Solve for Tomorrow

201
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,298
or the robotics stuff
that we're doing here,

202
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,200
we've got a STEM rotational.

203
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,436
The opportunities that brings
our students,

204
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,438
especially, like, some of those
things are all water related,

205
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:05,973
and being here on the island,

206
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,376
it's just a really cool
connection.

207
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,646
- Miranda: The reason why the
robotics program, I think,

208
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,348
is so successful
with our students

209
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,252
is because the kids take so much
ownership of it.

210
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,420
- Xander Weilbaker: This is
where we get to practice

211
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,723
the agility of our ROVs.

212
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,692
- Miranda: So their ROVs might
have to pick up, lift,

213
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,396
unlock, you know, drag,
do a bunch of different tasks.

214
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,698
But they, every year,
have to design their ROV

215
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,500
to do that the best.

216
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,336
We've competed within the
county, gone to regionals,

217
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:39,406
and then we have sent teams
to internationals,

218
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,641
and they're there to win.

219
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,144
Like, that is the whole purpose
of it.

220
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,879
[upbeat music]

221
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,051
We are a force
to be reckoned with.

222
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:56,590
We have heard people whispering
about Washington Island.

223
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,392
- Jaylyn Nickchen:
For internationals,

224
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,660
you go to Maryland

225
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,296
to compete internationally
against a bunch of kids

226
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,599
from different parts
of the world.

227
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,635
[upbeat music]

228
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:13,907
- Allison Bennett: I actually
have friends

229
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,342
that are from New Zealand

230
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:19,346
that I met there, and there's
people from China

231
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,382
and a bunch of places
all over the world.

232
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,452
- Producer: So, what do you tell
them about where you're from?

233
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,323
- We kinda say that
we're from a small island.

234
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,593
Usually, they think
it's tropical or something.

235
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,695
- Jaylyn: And then you say,
there's a little island,

236
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,430
there's actually, like,
several little islands.

237
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,999
There's one that's called
Washington Island.

238
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,369
I'm from nowhere,
but it's a wonderful place

239
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,105
with a wonderful community.

240
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,245
- When I was a kid,
I used to say

241
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,046
I wanted to be a bunch
of different things,

242
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,448
but the past few years,
I've stuck

243
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,849
with wanting to be
a marine biologist.

244
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,951
- I'm interested in going
into robotic engineering,

245
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,921
and that's definitely influenced
by being able to do SeaPerch,

246
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,690
which Mrs. Dahlke allowed us
to do.

247
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,926
So I have to thank her
for letting me

248
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,228
be able to experience something
like that.

249
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:13,634
- Isaac Weilbaker: I kinda put
her as, like, a fun teacher.

250
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,636
- I know people
around the world.

251
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,571
Their science teachers are
probably really cool,

252
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,806
but Mrs. Dahlke brings
so many opportunities

253
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,942
and fun stuff for us to learn.

254
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,777
- Ashlynn DeJardin: So many
opportunities for us students

255
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,613
and this school
to continue growing.

256
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,917
She really is passionate
about it.

257
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:34,421
- Like, they don't just need to
read from a science textbook.

258
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,491
I want them to actually
engage with nature

259
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:40,861
or solder something together.
[laughs]

260
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,463
[bell rings]
If I am not that way,

261
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,434
how can I expect my students
to be that way?

262
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,637
[indistinct conversation]

263
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:55,142
- I'm at the Pritzker Military
Museum and Library near Kenosha,

264
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,011
learning about their efforts
to be recognized as a hub

265
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,548
for military history
in the Midwest.

266
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,885
[rousing marching band music]

267
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,656
I met with Rachel Marcella,
Manager of Programs and Events,

268
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:13,660
to discover what visitors can
expect when they arrive here.

269
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,696
- Rachel Marcella: So as soon
as they come in,

270
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,031
you are right
in our exhibit space.

271
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,502
So they kinda just get
the whole experience.

272
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,404
We have over 40,000 artifacts
in our own collection

273
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,173
that we'll put on display.

274
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,509
We're not just a museum,
we're also the library.

275
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,712
So the library has 60,000 books.

276
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,881
We usually have
a couple exhibits

277
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,883
that are rotating through.

278
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,384
Right now, we have an exhibit

279
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,954
highlighting women of color
who have served.

280
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,556
- Angela: I love that
because I think

281
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,157
we all maybe have an idea
in mind

282
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,959
when we think of who represents
the armed services,

283
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,529
the armed forces that you all
are like, "Yes,

284
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,932
and these other individuals
also represent."

285
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,934
And so I appreciate the
intentionality that you all take

286
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,937
with uplifting those stories
that aren't often heard.

287
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,841
- We, as a country,
have gone through so much

288
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,876
and we will continue
to go through so much.

289
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,478
And it's so easy
to think that, like,

290
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,346
I am just living my piece in it,

291
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,816
but all of us as a community
are interwoven,

292
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,953
and it really helps strengthen
the ties, I think,

293
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,422
between the community.

294
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,924
[rousing marching band music]

295
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,293
- Angela: To explore that
military history,

296
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,697
I met up with Dustin DePue,
Director of Museum Collections,

297
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:27,134
who showed me a few items
found in archives here,

298
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,403
starting with trench art.

299
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,371
- Dustin DePue: Trench art
kind of became popularized

300
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:32,573
during World War I,

301
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,243
as there was millions
of artillery shells

302
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,178
littering the battlefields,

303
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,248
and so soldiers had a lot
of time on their hands.

304
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:44,585
They would often fashion it
into little art pieces,

305
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,387
use those to try to sell
or trade.

306
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,755
This is a piece

307
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,658
that's been sort of turned
into, like, a vase of some kind.

308
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,826
It is from a

309
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,863
French 75-millimeter
artillery shell casing.

310
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,131
It says "Verdun 1918."

311
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,567
Now, Verdun is a city
in northeastern France,

312
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:04,338
and it was the site of the
longest battle in World War I.

313
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,340
So a lot of times,
a piece like this

314
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,610
would've been made after the war
to commemorate that battle.

315
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:10,844
- Well, and that's interesting,

316
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,446
because you don't often think
about the materials

317
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,414
that are literally left behind
after battles

318
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,617
and what happens to them, other
than they just become waste.

319
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,218
- That's right.
- So the fact that

320
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,554
they're being repurposed.
- Yeah, exactly.

321
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,422
I have another item
from World War I.

322
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,825
We've got a little bit
of a theme going today.

323
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:28,762
What we have here is
what is called a Brodie helmet.

324
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,865
It's sometimes called
a Doughboy helmet as well.

325
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,234
This helmet was worn
by Samuel Rigoulot,

326
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,969
who was in the
3rd Infantry division

327
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,806
and was present in what's called
the Second Battle of the Marne.

328
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,342
It was an incredibly important
and decisive battle

329
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,510
in World War I.

330
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,779
He was the victim
of a chemical warfare attack,

331
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,382
and was forced
off the front lines

332
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,083
and had to convalesce
with a French family

333
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,085
until he sort of healed up.

334
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,287
He did survive.

335
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,622
- And I'm assuming his family
donated this.

336
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:56,857
- That's correct, yes.

337
00:15:56,924 --> 00:16:00,827
Yeah, so this is a real piece
of history here.

338
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,930
The last thing I have
is a lot more simple.

339
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:06,967
It is a mess kit,
so it's an American mess kit.

340
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,803
So our Doughboys,
as we call them,

341
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,405
when they were going overseas,
you know,

342
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,873
they would have this kit
with them,

343
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,410
and this is an instance of, you
can see some etching in there.

344
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,445
- So someone personalized
their mess kit.

345
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,613
- Dustin: Exactly.

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,215
You can see the Eiffel Tower
on there.

347
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,517
You can see a bald eagle.

348
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,687
- Angela: From equipment used
on the battlefield

349
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,423
to art found in the trenches,

350
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,492
Pritzker Military Museum
has a treasure trove

351
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,562
of military history to explore.

352
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,871
Let's switch gears
and cue the laughter

353
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,373
as we join in on the joke
with a comedian

354
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,443
taking the stage in Brookfield.

355
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,647
[upbeat music]

356
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,721
It's nearly showtime
at the Improv.

357
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,023
- We can't wait!

358
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,559
- Angela: Tonight's headliner
is Chastity Washington.

359
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,863
She is marking a milestone:
30 years in stand-up comedy.

360
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,965
- This is a long time coming,
you know, so...

361
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,467
- Angela: Chastity didn't expect
comedy

362
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,802
to become a lifelong avocation.

363
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,804
Freshman year at UW-Parkside,

364
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,541
Chastity and a sorority sister
saw a notice

365
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,610
for the student talent show
during homecoming.

366
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:26,013
- I remember contemplating it,
and she's like,

367
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,447
"I already signed you up,
whatever.

368
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,649
Just, you're gonna do it."

369
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,250
You know, I was like,
"Oh, my God!"

370
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,186
You know, so,
I wasn't seeking it out.

371
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,353
It found me.

372
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,189
- Hello, Chas!
- Hi!

373
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,358
- Angela: Her sorority sisters
still come out to cheer her on.

374
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,662
- I don't have enough words
to have that type of support

375
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,430
for your life.

376
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,933
- Angela: Chastity also gets
support from her fraternity

377
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,734
of fellow comedians.

378
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:52,573
They call me Auntie, [laughs]
but I like to see people grow.

379
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,508
- And are you ready
for your headliner tonight?

380
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,343
- Angela: Finally,
it's showtime.

381
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,848
- Host: Make a ton of noise
for Chastity Washington!

382
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,583
[audience cheers]

383
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,153
[upbeat music]

384
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,790
- Angela: The greatest influence
on Chastity's comedy

385
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:12,626
over the years
has been her day job.

386
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,662
- This is what teachers look
like when we off, you hear me?

387
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,097
How ya doing, y'all all right?

388
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,133
- Angela: During most of her
long career, when not on stage,

389
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,472
Chastity has been in schools,
teaching phy ed and drama.

390
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,675
An experience that has
given her plenty of material

391
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,010
over the years.

392
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,279
- Right, like now
at some schools,

393
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,883
if it's under 32 degrees,
the littles can't go outside,

394
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,385
which is ridiculous
to many of us.

395
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,487
'Cause we went outside,
it was nothing degrees.

396
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,655
[audience laughs]

397
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,991
You lost skin, eyes, fingers,
toes.

398
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,361
Somebody would bury you,
you'd be almost dead!

399
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,464
- Angela: Some of Chastity's
best material comes from kids

400
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,432
just being themselves.

401
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,134
- "Miss Washington,
can you help them?

402
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,402
"We doing the
activities portion.

403
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,570
"We doing the color wheel.

404
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,871
Could you help them?"

405
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:00,274
So we doing the color wheel,
and I asked them, I said,

406
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,276
"If you mix yellow and blue,
what do you get?"

407
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,077
And one of boys raised his hand
real fast.

408
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,245
I said, "You."

409
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,314
He said, "I wanna be
a firefighter."

410
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,183
[audience laughs]

411
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,656
True story.

412
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,024
That's what makes it fun.

413
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,526
That's the beauty of kids,
you know what I mean?

414
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:22,262
- Angela: Chastity herself
was a Milwaukee kid,

415
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,631
whose extended family
helped raise her,

416
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,167
especially her grandparents.

417
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,036
- Like, the house always,
you know,

418
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,004
smell like bakery and mothballs.

419
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,172
[audience laughs]

420
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh, I love my grandparents.

421
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,175
They was married 65 years,
right?

422
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,343
[audience applauds]

423
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,511
They're wonderful.

424
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,413
[laughs]
Wonderful.

425
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,581
Consistent.

426
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,749
It gave me
a different appreciation

427
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,285
and respect
for family in general.

428
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,955
- Angela: Chastity's extended
family makes for another source

429
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:52,726
of her relatable material, and
some outrageous stories as well.

430
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,928
- And you ever find out
something about a family member

431
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,196
you didn't know?

432
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,398
Like, we was sitting around
talking about my auntie.

433
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,000
We was talking about,
"Oh, she was wonderful.

434
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,635
Maybe she did this,
maybe she did that."

435
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,803
And they was like, "Yeah,

436
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,538
but what about that time
she stabbed Frank?"

437
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,541
Stabbed Frank?
[audience laughs]

438
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:13,080
Absolutely true story, exactly
how it happened. [laughs]

439
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:16,583
I thank you guys so much.
[audience cheers]

440
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,318
And friends and family,
thank you.

441
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,554
- Angela: She ends the night
marking 30 years

442
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,856
of making people laugh.

443
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,491
[audience cheers]

444
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,360
[friends exclaim]

445
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,898
Surrounded by fans and friends,
new and old.

446
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,534
- All: Yay!

447
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,435
- That was awesome to see, yes.

448
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,671
It's just very fulfilling.

449
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,742
You just grateful that, like,
people enjoy what you doing.

450
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,343
- We love you so much, honey.

451
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,245
- Chastity: That is wonderful
to me.

452
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,814
One for the record books,
you know?

453
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,550
Mm-hmm.

454
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,224
- Angela: Get your dancing shoes
for our last story.

455
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,693
We move and groove to Yuba,

456
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,762
where the hills of the Driftless
are alive

457
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,064
with the sound of music.

458
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,903
For most any traveler,

459
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,139
reaching the
Driftless Music Gardens

460
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,274
will come at the end
of a long trip.

461
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,543
- Crickett Lochner:
Come on down!

462
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,878
You made it!

463
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,179
Where you driving in from?

464
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:22,216
You are literally being taken
to the middle of nowhere

465
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,484
and then beyond.
[laughs]

466
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,154
They drove, like, eight hours.

467
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,822
- Angela: After that
long journey,

468
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,524
chances are
Crickett Lochner

469
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:32,860
will be there
with a warm welcome.

470
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,528
Hello!
- Driver: Hello!

471
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:36,964
- Crickett: We love sharing
the space with people

472
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,298
that appreciate it.

473
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,633
You made it!

474
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,868
Yeah!

475
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,736
- Angela: Thousands make it
each year

476
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,039
to set up tents and camp out,
stroll the grounds,

477
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:49,409
and listen to live music
at one of the summer festivals

478
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,378
held at the Gardens.

479
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,883
- Crickett: Peace, love, music,
community.

480
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,452
Why not enjoy music,
middle of nowhere,

481
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,120
and good weather?

482
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,288
- Angela: Crickett's greetings

483
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,323
are meant to make guests
feel at home.

484
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,425
- Jilly, hurry, hurry up!
- [laughs] Sorry!

485
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,428
- What's up, buddy?
[exclaims]

486
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,696
- Angela: Because it's
Crickett's home

487
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,999
that she's welcoming people to.

488
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,069
The Music Gardens occupy
the farm where she grew up.

489
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:19,540
Land that's been in her family
since the 1850s.

490
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:23,577
She lives in her childhood home
where her father also grew up.

491
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,179
- Sherry Wallace:
This will take it on

492
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,381
to the sixth generation now,
with Crickett.

493
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,550
- Angela: Crickett's not alone
on the farm.

494
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:33,420
Husband Tim might like it there
even more than his wife.

495
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:34,821
- Tim Lochner: I couldn't
be prouder

496
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,623
to have married
into this family.

497
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,025
I tell people people
all the time

498
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:41,195
that I married
into the hippie dream out here.

499
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,664
I'm growing vegetables,
I'm throwing music,

500
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,199
I'm hanging out
with my father-in-law

501
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:46,867
who looks just like
Willie Nelson.

502
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,669
[Sherry laughs]
- Just got out of the fields.

503
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,571
My husband, he's in a band.

504
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,639
[high-energy music]

505
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,108
- Angela: Tim's group,
the People Brothers Band,

506
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:58,178
had played
and put on music festivals.

507
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:00,380
That experience opened the
couple's eyes

508
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,916
to the family farm's potential.

509
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:04,418
- When we moved out here,

510
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,087
we kind of started dreaming of
having music over in this nook,

511
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:08,689
or music over in that nook.

512
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,824
Hence the
Driftless Music Gardens.

513
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,560
- Angela: Driftless for the
region's topography.

514
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,962
- Crickett: The glaciers never
came through

515
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:17,598
to readjust the landscape.

516
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:21,535
- Angela: And Driftless for the
vibe the land inspires.

517
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:24,037
- And that's the same with here.

518
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,205
It just flows.

519
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:28,242
The Driftless, it just,
you flow.

520
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,611
[drumsticks clack rhythmically]

521
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,347
- Angela: The number of music
lovers flowing to the Gardens

522
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,450
has grown steadily since 2016.

523
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:39,786
But this season marks
a new stage for the venture.

524
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:44,124
Literally, a new stage
to keep the shows going on.

525
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,926
- Crickett: Every ounce
of energy that we had

526
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:47,528
went into building that stage.

527
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,929
Love, sweat, and tears.

528
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,964
- Angela: But they didn't do it
alone.

529
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,734
The community they'd built
built it with them.

530
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,302
- Once we got
the project rolling,

531
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,804
we had to start making
a lot of phone calls

532
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,541
and calling in a lot of favors,
and have friends over.

533
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,344
And it was kind of like an
old-fashioned barn raising.

534
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:05,746
- Crickett: I think at one time,

535
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,116
we had 50 people out here just,
like, hammering away.

536
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:13,086
- Angela: Even the farmland
offered up its own contribution.

537
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,455
- Crickett: The inside
of the stage that you see

538
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,791
is the pine from the land.

539
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:21,094
And so,
it is a huge, proud moment

540
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:24,131
and love that we share
with the land.

541
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:28,335
All my team members that shared
a hand in building the stage,

542
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:33,740
the first show that we all saw,
it just brought tears of joy.

543
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,643
- Angela: It's a new landmark
on a landscape that's been home

544
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,214
to six generations
of Crickett's family.

545
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,815
But for all that's changed,

546
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:45,352
the life they live today
may not be so different.

547
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,020
- We're out here
farming music now

548
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:50,090
instead of growing corn
or raising cows.

549
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:53,126
There's some striking
similarities to what we do.

550
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,162
Everything is dependent
on the weather.

551
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:59,132
And if it's a great weekend,
we could have a good crop.

552
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,502
If it's gonna rain all weekend,
we're in trouble.

553
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:04,338
So no different
than a lot of my neighbors.

554
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:08,375
- Angela: But what they grow
here now feeds the soul.

555
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:11,144
- Crickett: Why did I come back
here?

556
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:15,315
Because it's where my bliss is,
where I feel home.

557
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:18,452
It calms me, balances me,
gets me rooted.

558
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,524
To be able to offer that to so
many others is a huge gift.

559
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:29,296
- We've patrolled Pritzker
Military Museum and Library,

560
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:32,032
checking out their collections
and exhibits

561
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,769
while meeting folks
from around our state.
