1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,753
Taxation without representation?

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,006
That's not the full story.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,927
Truth is, the young nation wanted
more and more territory.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:14,597
But native peoples and their 
region have their own incentive,

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,307
their strategies were legion,

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,393
their approaches were inventive.

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,270
More than just to survive,

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,230
but for their people to thrive.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,859
All this to regale
That  the American Revolution

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,612
is more than just the tale 
of British and colonial resolution.

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,282
It's multinational history

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:36,161
and Wisconsin's role 
is no longer a mystery.

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,413
But now it's your turn.

14
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,123
What would you like to learn?

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,668
Ask a friend or a teacher 
to come along

16
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,047
and get together
to write your own history song.
