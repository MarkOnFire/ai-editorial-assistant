- Angela Fitzgerald:
Accordion music

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,911
has danced across our state
for nearly 200 years.

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,882
Brought from the Old World
by European immigrants,

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:19,119
that polka sound is synonymous
with Wisconsin.

00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,655
[bright accordion music]

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,727
- Helmi Strahl Harrington:
It's unique and beautiful.

8
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,095
Everybody loves it.

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:33,100
- Angela: That's especially true
for Helmi Strahl Harrington.

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,102
- I've never known
another Helmi.

11
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,404
It means "pearl" in Finnish.

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,973
- Angela: Helmi is a pearl
like none other.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,179
And she founded the world's
largest accordion museum.

14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,018
- Helmi: It's nice that it
happens to be Wisconsin.

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,121
And I say with absolutely no
modesty that we are the best

16
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,457
because we have the most, but we
also have the most unusual.

17
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,194
And some of these are really
quite remarkable.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,632
For example, this is a table
organ that is like an accordion.

19
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,801
This is for right hand,
this is for left hand.

20

[playing scale on table organ]

21
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,508
- Angela: A World of Accordions
Museum in Superior

22
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,644
is home to instruments
that play a unique role

23
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,614
in its evolution and history.

24
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,216
- Helmi: It's
a very complex instrument

25
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,685
that has developed
over 200 years

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,689
and now has 2,500 examples
downstairs.

27
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,991
Look at how big these guys are.

28
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,794
This one has 220 buttons
in the left hand,

29
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,663
and this one has seven octaves
in the right hand.

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,266
We started a collection
of unusual accordions

31
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,569
not to be sold,
but to be cherished.

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,207
- Angela: The oldest instrument
on display sits here.

33
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,278
- Helmi: Well, the patent
is 1829 in Vienna, Austria,

34
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,281
but it was already in progress
in Germany,

35
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,683
in Berlin and elsewhere.

36
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,152
- Angela: The accordion could
also be described

37
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,388
as an instrument of war.

38
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:10,397
It helped Helmi's family rise
from the ashes of World War II.

39
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,900
- Helmi: If it weren't
for accordions,

40
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,668
my mother wouldn't have
survived the war,

41
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,503
and that included me.

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,339
My mother and grandmother
had been evacuated

43
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:23,343
from Cologne to south Germany,
and that's where I was born.

44
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,980
We survived because my mother
could entertain the troops

45
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,383
at the Red Cross station.

46
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,886
My grandmother, my mother,
and me.

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,454
And that's how it was.

48
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,457
I never took my eyes off what
she was doing.

49
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,126
- Angela: The gift
of accordion music

50
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:42,329
would be her mother's gateway
to America.

51
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,466
- She saved three accordions,
and she took them on board ship

52
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,303
when she came across the sea
with me,

53
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,073
and an American soldier decided
nobody needs three.

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,808
So, he threw one over.

55
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,777
- Angela: The two accordions
that still exist

56
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,679
are here in the museum.

57
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,449
- This was the one that she
taught thousands of people on.

58
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,319
I was eight and began to study
how to play

59
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,854
and then how to repair.

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,089
I stuck my nose in her business
right away

61
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,058
and loved every moment of it.

62
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,961
It was something that she loved,
and therefore I loved it.

63
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,696
- Anglea: Passed from mother
to daughter,

64
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,766
the love of music survived war
and endures on stage

65
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,103
in a former church
that houses the museum.

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,842
- We have about a million pieces
of music in the music library.

67
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,679
We have a thousand books
and several thousand recordings

68
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,982
of the infamous and the famous.

69
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,117
We have repair shops.

70
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,087
- Well, it's not in great shape.

71
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,691
- Helmi: It doesn't matter how
wonderful the musical sound is

72
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,762
and how much enthusiasm
it gives your soul.

73
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,299
It still is a piece of machinery
that needs repair.

74
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,134
- Angela: Preserving accordions
would prove to be

75
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,003
a life's work for Helmi.

76
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,141
Now, in her golden years,
she sees change on the horizon.

77
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,910
- I'm 78 years old now.

78
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,748
I have stage five cancer,
and I've been on the fifth year

79
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,818
of a two-year life expectancy
for a long time now,

80
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,921
and so I'm hoping it'll continue
a little longer,

81
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,223
but I make no illusions.

82
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,028
- Angela: Like her mother,

83
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,431
the accordion has helped Helmi
through her darkest hours.

84
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,000
And her passion
has never wavered.

85
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,670
- Helmi: I started off playing
just because I loved it,

86
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,405
and I still do.

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,542
The music is what they say.

88
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,813
It keeps you happy, keeps your
inside humming and strumming

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,415
as it should.

90
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,252
- Angela: The accordion reflects
Helmi's childhood in Germany,

91
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,424
her history, and a museum
celebrated around the world.

92
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,961
- Helmi: So much has happened
in the last 200 years.

93
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,996
Things have been lost,
have been burned,

94
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,465
have been killed by bombs.

95
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,635
The history of the accordion,
its construction and its music,

96
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,804
falls into that risk category.

97
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,474
That's part of the passion
because in the end,

98
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,877
I'm proud not just
of the result,

99
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,545
but of what it took
to get there.

100
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,915
The goal is to keep that going
beyond me.

101
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,317
