00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,979
- Narrator: What do you do
if you have a goal

3
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,348
that's really hard to achieve?

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,317
How do you overcome obstacles
and challenges,

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,320
especially if there's
no clear direction?

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,790
Today, we're going to learn
about Georgia O'Keeffe.

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,726
She wanted to become an artist
at a time

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,896
when there weren't many women
who became famous artists,

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,865
so she had to chart
her own path.

10
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,972
Georgia O'Keeffe was born

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,644
just outside of Sun Prairie,
Wisconsin, in 1887.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,581
She was the second child
in a family of seven children.

13
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,751
The O'Keeffe family
lived on a farm.

14
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,153
That meant lots of chores
for everyone,

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,856
including milking cows,
working with horses,

16
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,358
and tending to the
vegetable garden.

17
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,960
But there was still time
for hide-and-seek

18
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,962
in the family's big barns,

19
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,365
or playing on the swings
behind their house.

20
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,468
In the evenings, Georgia's
mother often read history books

21
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,538
and adventure stories
to the children.

22
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,607
In the winter of 1898,

23
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,344
11-year-old Georgia
started art lessons.

24
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,379
She loved drawing and painting,

25
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,282
and what was most exciting
was the process of learning

26
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,719
and doing her best
to keep improving at her art.

27
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,488
But doing her best work
wasn't always easy.

28
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,390
One winter night,
she was painting a scene

29
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,259
outside her window.

30
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,962
As she was working,
she realized how hard it was

31
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,731
to show trees and snow
in the moonlight.

32
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,234
Georgia loved to look closely
at the world.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,669
She could see the colors
of the landscape,

34
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,339
but figuring out which colors
of paint to use

35
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,774
to capture them wasn't easy.

36
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,177
What was the right shade
for the dark trees?

37
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,912
Or for the sky?

38
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,481
None of these challenges
stopped Georgia.

39
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,851
She kept working at her drawings
and paintings.

40
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,353
When a friend in eighth grade

41
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,889
asked her what she wanted to be
when she grew up,

42
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,891
Georgia didn't hesitate.

43
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,693
"I'm going to be an artist."

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,462
Georgia continued
her art lessons

45
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,631
when she started high school.

46
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,100
But on the first day of classes,
her art teacher,

47
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,837
Sister Angelique,
criticized one of her drawings.

48
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,573
She said it was too small
and dark.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,577
Georgia was crushed,
and did her best not to cry.

50
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,747
But instead of giving up,
she kept working at her goal

51
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,649
to get better at drawing.

52
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,652
She made her drawings bigger
and lighter.

53
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,221
By the end of the year,
one of them was even chosen

54
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,257
to be featured
in the school catalog!

55
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,825
In just a few years,

56
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,329
Georgia was attending the best
art schools in the country.

57
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,366
First, the Art Institute
of Chicago in 1905,

58
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,336
and then the Art Students League
in New York City,

59
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,071
starting in 1907.

60
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:57,044
But she still faced obstacles to
her dream of becoming an artist.

61
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,079
One day at art school
in New York,

62
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,949
another student stopped her
in the stairway.

63
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,151
He told her that she'd never be
a great artist

64
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:08,989
no matter what she did, but that
<i>he</i> would be a great painter.

65
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,558
Did this make Georgia give up?

66
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,726
No!

67
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,229
Georgia did the only thing
that mattered:

68
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,132
she ignored her classmate
and turned back to her art.

69
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,003
She kept painting and drawing,
and even started teaching art.

70
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,406
Rather than listening to people
who said she couldn't do things,

71
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,109
she focused on her friends
and family,

72
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,845
the people who believed in her.

73
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:35,382
Soon, Georgia's work was getting
attention from the art world.

74
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:40,254
In 1917, she had her first show
at a gallery in New York City,

75
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,756
a big deal for a young artist!

76
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:47,094
More and more shows at galleries
and museums followed.

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,864
In the 1940s, Georgia moved
to New Mexico.

78
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,334
By this point, she was
recognized as a great artist.

79
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,771
She was known for her paintings
of flowers, buildings,

80
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,073
bones, and landscapes.

81
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,377
Just like she'd done
ever since she was a child,

82
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,712
Georgia looked closely
at the world

83
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,715
and worked hard to express her
personal vision in her art

84
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,784
throughout her life.

85
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:15,355
Georgia's childhood in Wisconsin
had a huge impact on her.

86
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,025
Farm life taught her the value
of hard work,

87
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,660
and storytimes with her mother

88
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,730
instilled a lifelong love of art
and education.

89
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,898
There were many times

90
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,568
when Georgia might have given up
on her dream,

91
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,571
but she chose
to keep working at it.

92
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,973
Her story is a reminder
to all of us

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,276
to keep going even when
obstacles block our path,

94
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,246
and to stop and enjoy the beauty
around us

95
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,882
whenever we get the chance.

96
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,752
