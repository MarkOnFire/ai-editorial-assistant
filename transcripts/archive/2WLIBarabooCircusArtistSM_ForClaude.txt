1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,709
[relaxed acoustic music]

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,959
Visit Sauk County,
and there's a good chance

3
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:08,999
of coming across artwork
by Joan Stevens.

4
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:11,959
- I did a sign
for the Baraboo-Dells Airport.

5
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,417
I love driving by
that sign.

6
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:15,999
Roy's Classic Cars.

7
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,999
It looks like
a 1950s Shell station,

8
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:23,667
and did some pinstriping on
a couple of features in there.

9
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,999
There's an airplane hangar
in the corner.

10
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:28,041
I had to put the lettering
up on top of it

11
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,792
that said "Luther Field,"
which was really cool.

12
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:35,417
- And in downtown Baraboo,
home of the Circus Parade...

13
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:40,959
- I painted a 15-foot
wagon wheel on the pavement

14
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,999
in front of
the AL. Ringling Theater.

15
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,999
It's held up pretty good.

16
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,999
- Circus art
is Joan's specialty,

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,250
where her
precision brushwork

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,999
is helping restore and preserve
the past.

19
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,333
- I am passionate
about what I do.

20
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,667
I say that I specialize
in restoration

21
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,709
because I use
the old trade skills

22
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:01,999
that I've learned
over the years--

23
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:06,000
still hand painting
and antiquing and gold gilding.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A good day is when

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,583
I can stay
in my grubby blue jeans

26
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:14,750
and come out to the shop
and sling some paint.
[laughs]

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,458
I have to smell turpentine
and have paint on my hands

28
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,999
pretty much every day.

29
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:22,458
Otherwise, it feels like
something's missing.

30
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,125
- She also had
a brush with fame,

31
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:29,250
restoring wagons that appeared
in the 2011 award-winning movie

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,999
<i>Water for Elephants.</i>

33
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:34,999
- I was able to do
the Sells Floto Ticket Wagon

34
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,333
down at Circus World,
#62.

35
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:41,166
- Joan's personal storyline
mirrors the movie

36
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,542
as she found herself
seeking adventure.

37
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,291
- I kind of ran away
with the carnival.

38
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,583
It sounds good
when you say it that way,

39
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,458
but I took a job.

40
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,208
I took off
with a bag of clothes

41
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,000
and enough money
to get back home.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,625
I was surrounded by
hand-painted signs and images,

43
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,959
and the rides were still
hand-painted at that time.

44
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,999
And it just kind of was an
immediate connection that I had.

45
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,250
- Joan ran away
in search of her dreams

46
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,333
and then discovered them

47
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,041
right in her hometown
of Baraboo.

48
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,000
- When I came home,

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,709
I was determined
to continue to paint signs.

50
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,542
And Circus World
seemed like a pretty good fit.

51
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:25,999
And I've been there ever since,
which is, I think 37 years if...

52
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,999
But who's counting?
[laughs]

53
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,667
- Joan is currently
putting the finishing touches

54
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,041
on a wagon
for Circus World.

55
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,875
- Ta-da!

56
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:40,583
We're gonna go down
to the wagon shop,

57
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:45,792
get to come in,
and start decorating.

58
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,250
- So, these are the skyboards
off of #44,

59
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,917
Gollmar Lion and Tiger Tableau.

60
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:56,875
It was a cage wagon
turned into a baggage wagon,

61
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,959
and then they used it
in parades.

62
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
- When they started
to restore the wagon,

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,583
took the old panels off

64
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,999
and uncovered
these beautiful paintings.

65
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:10,250
And I'm reproducing them
to put back on the wagon.

66
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,792
I love to see
the finished project.

67
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,999
- On any given day,
in the winter storage

68
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,709
barn at Circus World...

69
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,291
- I think there's
around 260 wagons, give or take.

70
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,999
- Joan's artwork can be found
around every turn.

71
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,417
- The old woman
who lives in a shoe wagon

72
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,999
was quite lengthy

73
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:35,291
because it had to be taken apart
layer by layer and recarved,

74
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,458
'cause there was
a lot missing.

75
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,208
To just do the gilding,

76
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,999
I think I probably had
around five, six months in it.

77
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,375
I was in tears,

78
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,999
wondering if I was
ever gonna get through it.

79
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,834
I swore I'd never do
another one, but bring it on.

80
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,750
I'd love to do another one.
[laughs]

81
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,083
When the gold shines,
nothing shines brighter.

82
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,999
I like the Buffalo Bill wagon.

83
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:00,999
It's hard to really say
which one is my favorite piece.

84
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,333
- Throughout the years,
Joan says her appreciation

85
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,709
for the artistry
of circus wagons has grown.

86
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,999
- It's amazing what the guys
can do in the wagon shop

87
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,041
as far as
rebuilding the wagons.

88
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,041
And then, I come in,
and I'm the happy painter.

89
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,875
I get to make it shine
with the finishing details.

90
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,875
Pretty soon, you've got 30, 40
years of projects behind you.

91
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,625
I never know what's gonna come
through the door.

92
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,291
It's exciting!

93
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,999
I think
they move together, too.

94
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:32,125
Oh, yeah,
look at 'em go. [laughs]

95
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,792
I just think
it's so rewarding

96
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:37,041
to see people enjoying
what I do.
