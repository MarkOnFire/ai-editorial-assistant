in Apostle Islands history.

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,000
She was a young woman

from a well-to-do family
in St. Paul,

on Sand Island

where they would go

The government essentially
walked away from the building.

<i>- By 1925,
 Gert's cherished lighthouse</i>

into disrepair.</i>

33

Gertrude pulled as many strings
as she possibly could

00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:52,834
and got this lease negotiated
with the Department of Commerce

00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:56,333
to occupy the lighthouse
for $50.

39

Plus, she was responsible now
for the upkeep.

in many ways.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,917
She was not restricted by
the rigid gender expectations.

47
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,458
She dressed up as a keeper.

48

She wore a sailor suit

and very, very much
a part of the --

welcome and beloved
part of the community.

<i>Today, Sand Island Light</i>

70
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,250
- Bob Mackreth:
She absolutely
kept that lighthouse

71
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,000
from falling apart

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,208
so we can look at it
in its glory today,

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,291
rather than
just some old ruin there

74
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,333
with a steel tower
out in front.

75
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,792
So, I think very highly
of Gert Wellisch.
