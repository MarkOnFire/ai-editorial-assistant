1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,906
- Kai: These are our agreements

2
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,575
for creating a community
of writers.

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,444
- Shepherd: Every idea
is a good idea,

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,247
and every idea can be revised.

5
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,148
You are full of so many
wonderful ideas,

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,817
and we want to hear them all.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,219
And you're allowed
to change your ideas.

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,990
So maybe you have an idea
for a magical unicorn castle

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:27,027
that you turn
into a giant shark rocket.

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,364
That's fantastic,
and we love to hear it.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,367
- Support each other's ideas!

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,703
In order for everyone to share
all their good ideas,

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,772
we have to support each other.

14
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:42,476
I wanna support you,
and I want you to support me.

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,012
We can do that by saying yes
to each other

16
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,747
and adding on
to each other's ideas,

17
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,615
like, "Yes, I love that!

18
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,617
And also, what about this?"

19
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,153
- Dawry: Respect yourself
and others.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,323
Sometimes, the scariest thing
is sharing your own ideas.

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,059
But remember,
every idea is a good idea.

22
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,061
So we wanna create an
environment

23
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,463
where you can be silly and goofy

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,401
so everyone else can also be
silly and goofy too.

25
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,569
- Keep the peace.

26
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,837
Just like it's important for us

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,638
to be respectful of ourselves
and others,

28
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,708
it's important for us to be
respectful in our bodies.

29
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,910
So, you don't know this yet,

30
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,612
but I did install
a magical cupboard

31
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,013
right above your head.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,715
Go ahead and open that cupboard
up,

33
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,116
reach around in there.

34
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,985
You might have to move some
stuff around.

35
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,153
Find a little button.

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,821
This is your magical force field
button.

37
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,723
Put that button
on top of your head.

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,325
Make sure it's on nice
and secure.

39
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,493
Hit your magical force field
button. [pop]

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,596
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha.

41
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,664
To activate your magical
force field

42
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,933
so that you can be
a racecar driver

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,570
or a food fighter
or a football player,

44
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,139
and you don't have to worry
about causing a traffic accident

45
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,276
or accidentally tackling
one of your neighbors.

46
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,278
- And respect the magic sign.

47
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,646
Here in Whoopensocker City,

48
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,848
we have a fun way of trying
to get everyone's attention.

49
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,783
When someone says,
"Whoop it up!"

50
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,620
Everyone says...
- Kids in unison: Sock it to me!

51
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,189
- And if you have your own
magic sign in your classroom,

52
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,624
feel free to use that one.

53
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,459
The point is that we need
a fun way

54
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,060
of getting everyone's attention

55
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,329
for all the fun stuff
that we have planned.

56
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,365
- Pretty cool agreements, right?

57
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,434
Well, now it is time for us
to agree to them.

58
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,970
So take out your right hand.

59
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,839
Make a W with your fingers,
just like this,

60
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,908
and repeat after me.

61
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,876
I agree...
- I agree.

62
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,345
- To the agreements.
- To the agreements.

63
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,548
- In agreement.
- In agreement.

64
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,183
- And for pereptual agreement's
sake...

65
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,852
- And for pereptual agreement's
sake...

66
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,188
- Most agreeably.
- Most agreeably.

67
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,424
- With the agreeatudeness.
- With the agreeatudeness.

68
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,359
- A-whoop it up!
- A-whoop it up!

69
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,695
- A-sock it to me!
- A-sock it to me!

70
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,531
- Nice.
- These are our agreements.

71
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,699
Force field high-five?

72
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,100
Yeah, let's do it,
force field high-five!

73
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,170
