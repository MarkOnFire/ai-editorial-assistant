1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,939
- BJ Winslow: I feel like every
place has a spooky factor.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,010
But I do find it is unique here
in Wisconsin.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,881
- Eileen Winslow: There's
definitely a weird factor.

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:18,085
It's something that we enjoy
tapping into.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,521
Hi, I'm Eileen Winslow.
- And I'm BJ Winslow.

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,356
- And we run Dapper Cadaver.

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,325
[spooky music]
[prop shrieks]

8
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:32,165
- Who wants to play a funny
little trick tonight? [laughs]

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,205
- We make and provide
death-related props and decor

10
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:41,675
for a number of industries,
including productions,

11
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:45,679
attractions, and educational
facilities worldwide.

12
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,281
- BJ: We also have the shop.

13
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:51,118
We're located here
in Madison, Wisconsin.

14
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,654
We do stuff that is, like,
Halloween characters

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,489
that you're gonna see
in a haunted house

16
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,924
or an amusement park.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,061
And then we also do realistic
dummies for film and television.

18
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,964
- We've provided things
for <i>American Horror Story,</i>

19
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>Law and Order, 911, Shogun.</i>

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,073
- We start
with a liquid material.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,177
Urethane, polyurethane,
polyfoam, silicone.

22
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:22,049
We've got a fab team that are
gonna be filling the molds.

23
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,451
A lot of our molds
are realistic heads,

24
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,053
are realistic bodies
and body parts.

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,756
Those are life cast off
of actual people.

26
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,225
Once it's all set up,

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,361
the liquid material
becomes an expanding foam.

28
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,198
So a small piece can be set
in, like, an hour

29
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,067
and a larger piece over four.

30
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,337
And then, you know, once it's
all set up,

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,074
you can crack open the mold,
pull it out,

32
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,543
brush the skin layers,

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,514
and you've got yourself
a realistic body.

34
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,984
- Eileen: I'm originally from
Milwaukee, south side.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,819
- BJ: I'm originally
from California.

36
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,988
I grew up
in northern California.

37
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,323
I've been making things
for as long as I can remember.

38
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,925
- I had graduated

39
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,427
from the University
of Southern California.

40
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,062
We met through friends in LA.

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,865
It was actually right after BJ
had moved down

42
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,333
from northern California.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,471
And I started doing props
after I got out of college,

44
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,140
working at another guy's shop.

45
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,242
And I wanted to branch out
on my own,

46
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,745
and, y'know, we were able to.

47
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,780
[spray paint hissing]

48
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,750
- BJ was making props
in our garage,

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,619
and then I had helped him
set up a website,

50
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,056
'cause actually at that point,
I worked in internet marketing.

51
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,357
- And that was huge.

52
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,626
Nobody else was doing prop shop
websites at the time.

53
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,328
- It started to grow
to the point

54
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,629
where then,
it wasn't sustainable

55
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,598
to keep doing it from the house.

56
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,468
We started the business,
we got married,

57
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,505
went on a honeymoon, came back,
and then--

58
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,575
- And opened.
- And opened, yeah.

59
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,413
We moved back here
in fall of 2020.

60
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,917
We really like the business
environment in Wisconsin.

61
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,085
There you go.

62
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,486
- Customer: Thank you.
- Thank you.

63
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,189
It's really great for the bulk
of what we do,

64
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,658
which is manufacturing.

65
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,560
When we were moving,
there was no guarantee

66
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,464
that people would continue
calling us.

67
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,435
And we're just extremely happy
and grateful that they did.

68
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,636
It's been a leap of faith

69
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,972
in terms of continuing
to grow the business

70
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,707
in new ways as well.

71
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,744
- We've done a number of dummies

72
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,046
for UW-Platteville
forensic training.

73
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,715
These are people
that are going to school

74
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,884
to become
forensic investigators.

75
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,754
And we recently did
a brand-new type of dummy

76
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,992
where it has lividity
that's like bruising.

77
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,661
It will actually bleach
when you touch it

78
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,996
and then go back to pink,

79
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,967
so we developed a type of paint
that does that as well.

80
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,371
It's nice to go into work and
have, like, both sides of things

81
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,340
where it's like, "Today, I'm
gonna do something really stupid

82
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,608
and I'm gonna love it,"

83
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,943
or "Today, I'm gonna do
something

84
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,245
that could save lives."

85
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,650
In the fall, we like
to do the night market.

86
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,385
There we go, cool.

87
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,521
We like to put out one
of our great characters.

88
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,891
And people love to take their
pictures with 'em.

89
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,093
And that's always fun.

90
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,299
We do September and October here
'cause that's our season.

91
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,835
- One of the things I loved
with working with BJ

92
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,403
well over a decade now

93
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,973
is just seeing him grow
as an artist and as a person.

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,044
- Yeah, I can't imagine
doing this on my own.

95
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,648
- I love working
with creative people

96
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,352
and I love working with people
that are helping other people.

97
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,621
If you can do that for a living,

98
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,890
what else can you ask for
in life?

99
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,960
- Yeah, and it's fun.
