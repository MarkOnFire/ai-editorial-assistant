1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:04,104
[gentle orchestral music]

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,874
- Alexander Platt: I was living
in the Twin Cities,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,543
and the La Crosse Symphony was
looking for guest conductors

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,278
in 1993, 1994.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,182
And I had an absolutely
wonderful time,

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,385
which I just retained
in my memory

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:23,156
this wistful time discovering
this beautiful city

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,392
nestled on the banks
of the Mississippi.

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,661
And then, so, in 2010,

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,663
the LSO was doing
a music director search.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,131
So I was, at that point,

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,334
I was like the suitor
standing at the doorbell

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,437
with the bouquet
and the box of chocolates.

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,273
'Cause I really wanted
to come to La Crosse

15
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,408
and settle down and do the work

16
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,077
I think I've always been meant
to do.

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,481
So they blessed me with this
wonderful job,

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,218
and it was the post-2008 world
for orchestras

19
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,354
and there were profound
financial challenges,

20
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,558
and we truly met
those challenges

21
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,661
and through this
beautiful community.

22
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,230
And to be enabled
to give La Crosse

23
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,799
the best orchestra
it could possibly have,

24
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,303
and that's been our journey
together.

25
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,872
[bright orchestral music]

26
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,578
This is the last big concert
of the season.

27
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,414
We start with one of the great,

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,151
world-class classical music
soloists

29
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,887
from right here in the Midwest,

30
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,624
one of my greatest Chicago
colleagues,

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,862
the great, great American
violinist Rachel Barton Pine,

32
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,698
with whom I was very privileged
to make,

33
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,300
many years ago,
20 years ago it was,

34
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,805
what remains a rather famous
recording of a piece

35
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:48,008
called the <i>Scottish Fantasy</i>
by Max Bruch.

36
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,810
So we celebrate that
great partnership

37
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,411
that Rachel and I have had,

38
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,014
and also not only
the personal partnership,

39
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,584
but again, this truly
world-class musician

40
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,785
who is right here,

41
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,587
in our own neighborhood
of the upper Midwest.

42
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,989
And she's gonna be playing

43
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,426
the eternally beautiful
Violin Concerto of Brahms.

44
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,397
So that's gonna be a real honor
to work with her on that.

45
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,232
[bright orchestral music]

46
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,034
Then after the intermission,

47
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,738
we wrap up the concert
and wrap up the season

48
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,508
celebrating one of my great
personal loves

49
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,378
in the repertoire, which is the
French repertoire.

50
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,848
The gorgeous, glorious music
of Maurice Ravel,

51
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,385
one of the masters
of French Impressionism.

52
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,719
[bright orchestral music]

53
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,989
And we've put together
a beautiful montage

54
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,624
of three works,

55
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,794
three of the greatest orchestral
works of Maurice Ravel

56
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,530
that all center on the dance.

57
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,467
And I think it sums up
everything we wanna do

58
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:51,471
as classical musicians,
to give people this,

59
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,173
you know, I know it's an
old-fashioned phrase,

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,642
but truth and beauty,
beauty and truth.

61
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,379
To give people an ideal beauty
that they,

62
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:03,884
now more than ever, cannot find
anywhere else in our world.

63
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,619
But to do so in a way

64
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:11,592
that makes us all as individuals
treasure what we have.

65
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,730
I've spent my whole life
with music,

66
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,799
being a student of music.

67
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,169
I'm not a scholar, but a student
of music, and I like to think,

68
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:26,673
a student of history
and culture and the arts,

69
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,744
and I love sharing with people
what I do know

70
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,280
by this point of the journey

71
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,182
about what makes
this music great

72
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,317
and what makes it so relevant,

73
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,353
absolutely relevant
to our lives,

74
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,323
and it's always a pleasure
to share what I know.

75
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,092
And people seem to enjoy it,

76
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,595
or else they're just being
even nicer than I think.

77
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,163
I'm now a man of 60,

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,035
and I've been plugging away
at this conducting racket

79
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,904
for a good 40 years.

80
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,807
And I want to do everything
I can

81
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,679
to continue what I've been doing
to bring to La Crosse

82
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:10,250
the finest symphony experience
they can possibly have.

83
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,554
To explore new
and forgotten paths

84
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,925
in this great repertoire
we have, and also to,

85
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,327
you know, to venerate
the great familiar works

86
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,496
that we all know and love.

87
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,800
And I do like to think,

88
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,670
I hope I'll be forgiven
for saying that I think, for me,

89
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,005
the La Crosse Symphony
is the crown jewel

90
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,442
of the cultural scene
in this Coulee region.

91
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,877
If that is a reflection

92
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,913
on what we've been able to do
together for the last 15 years,

93
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,883
then I'll take the compliment.
