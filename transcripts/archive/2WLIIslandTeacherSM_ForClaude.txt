1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,703
[whistling]

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,341
- Miranda Dahlke: I say
I'm from Wisconsin,

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,543
but then when we dig deeper,
I just have to say

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,747
I'm in the middle
of Lake Michigan. [laughs]

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,716
[upbeat music]

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,156
I'm Miranda Dahlke, and I teach
science exclusively,

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,893
essentially,
here on Washington Island.

8
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:30,097
As well as a STEM elective
for middle school.

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,698
- Tim Verboomen: There's
six miles of water

10
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,866
between us and the mainland,

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,836
and the ferry operations
just make it impossible

12
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,437
for our students to attend
school anywhere else

13
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,605
other than here.

14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,008
- So obviously, when we look
at our data...

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,011
You're in the same building,
just over 60 kids

16
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,879
from 4K through 12.

17
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,583
All the kids pretty much
know each other,

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,320
so we like to say they end up
acting like a family.

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,656
And I have little visitors.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,458
- I'm a little, I'm a big kid.
[Miranda laughs]

21
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:02,529
- Your seatbelt is stuck.
[students laugh]

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,135
- What I try to do with the
different programs

23
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,838
that we do and bringing in all
these different activities

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,273
is I try to give them
a realistic idea

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,809
of other careers that aren't
just owning a business

26
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,745
or being part of a family
business up here.

27
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,014
- I was the structural engineer.

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,316
- I was the electrical engineer.

29
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,184
- I was the mechanical engineer.

30
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,352
- Miranda: Totally awesome

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,954
if you wanna go run your
family's business.

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,288
We need that, obviously.

33
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:33,660
But my goal is to try to connect
anything that we do extra

34
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,563
or bonus or anything that
they're getting involved in,

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,166
if I can tie it to a career
or potential idea of, like,

36
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,035
you could do this for a living.

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,705
- And she's fantastic with that.

38
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,608
So whether it's SeaPerch or the
Samsung Solve for Tomorrow

39
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,343
or the robotics stuff
that we're doing here,

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,144
we've got a STEM rotational.

41
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,413
The opportunities that brings
our students,

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,415
especially, like, some of those
things are all water related,

43
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,950
and being here on the island,

44
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,354
it's just a really cool
connection.

45
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,490
- Miranda: The reason why the
robotics program, I think,

46
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,225
is so successful
with our students

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,229
is because the kids take so much
ownership of it.

48
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,432
- This is where we get
to practice the agility

49
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,334
of our ROVs.

50
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,537
- Miranda: So their ROVs might
have to pick up, lift,

51
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,407
unlock, you know, drag,
do a bunch of different tasks.

52
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,776
But they, every year,
have to design their ROV

53
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,511
to do that the best.

54
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,381
We've competed within the
county, gone to regionals,

55
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,184
and then we have sent teams
to internationals,

56
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,652
and they're there to win.

57
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,922
Like, that is the whole purpose
of it.

58
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,657
[upbeat music]

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,962
We are a force
to be reckoned with.

60
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:47,501
We have heard people whispering
about Washington Island.

61
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,103
- For internationals,
you go to Maryland

62
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,307
to compete internationally
against a bunch of kids

63
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,610
from different parts
of the world.

64
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,313
[upbeat music]

65
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,119
- I actually have friends
that are from New Zealand

66
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,357
that I met there, and there's
people from China

67
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,260
and a bunch of places
all over the world.

68
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,463
- Producer: So what do you tell
them about where you're from?

69
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,167
- We kinda say that
we're from a small island.

70
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,370
Usually, they think
it's tropical or something.

71
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,672
- And then you say,
there's a little island,

72
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,474
there's actually, like,
several little islands.

73
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,977
There's one that's called
Washington Island.

74
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,380
I'm from nowhere,
but it's a wonderful place

75
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,116
with a wonderful community.

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,155
- When I was a kid,
I used to say

77
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,957
I wanted to be a bunch
of different things,

78
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,359
but the past few years,
I've stuck

79
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,760
with wanting to be
a marine biologist.

80
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,962
- I'm interested in going
into robotic engineering,

81
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,932
and that's definitely influenced
by being able to do SeaPerch,

82
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,701
which Mrs. Dahlke allowed us
to do.

83
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,803
So I have to thank her
for letting me

84
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,173
be able to experience something
like that.

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,910
- I kinda put her as, like,
a fun teacher.

86
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,413
- I know people
around the world,

87
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,415
their science teachers are
probably really cool,

88
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,817
but Mrs. Dahlke brings
so many opportunities

89
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,786
and fun stuff for us to learn.

90
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,656
- So many opportunities for us
students and this school

91
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,558
to continue growing.

92
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,861
She really is passionate
about it.

93
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,199
- Like, they don't just need to
read from a science textbook.

94
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,535
I want them to actually
engage with nature

95
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,805
or solder something together.
[laughs]

96
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,308
[bell rings]
If I am not that way,

97
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,045
how can I expect my students
to be that way?

98
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,781
[indistinct conversation]
