00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:01,735
If you grew up

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,438
in Shawano County, chances
are you've heard of Twigs.

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,774
And if you grew up in Wisconsin,
there's an even better chance

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,077
you sipped on a Sun Drop.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,779
Back in the 1950s.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,248
Floyd “Twig” Hartwig

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,850
brought the golden cola
to the Northwoods,

8
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,620
and it's been a family
favorite ever since.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,525
We're probably bottling
about a half a million cases.

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,594
So, I mean,
if you multiply that by 24,

11
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,797
that's about how many
bottles we bottle every year.

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,667
For three generations,
the Hartwigs have bottled
Sun Drop

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:37,504
their own sodas
and even Shawano's favorite
water

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,273
Keeping the tradition alive.

15
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,808
One glass bottle at a time.
