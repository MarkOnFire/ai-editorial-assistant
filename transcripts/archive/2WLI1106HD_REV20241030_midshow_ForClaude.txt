- We're touring the State
Archive Preservation Facility
in Madison

00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,792

historical conservation.

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,999
I started my archive adventure

6
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,500
by chatting
with Christian Overland,

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,291
the Wisconsin Historical Society
Director and CEO.

8
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,999
- Overland: Well, the State
Archive Preservation Facility

9
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:21,709
is actually where

10
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:24,375
all Wisconsin's
historic treasure is housed.

11
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,125
I think of it,
actually,

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,999
as the nerve center
of everything that we do.

13
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:32,999
We have everything
from film to 3D objects.

14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:33,999
We have archives.

15
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:35,709
We have library materials
here, too.

16
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:39,291
- Are there just items from
Wisconsin that are stored here

17
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,917
or from other places as well?

18
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,999
- What's fascinating about the
Wisconsin Historical Society,

19
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,999
we're the only state
historical society in the union

20
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:49,417
that's charged to collect
North American history,

21
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,917
as well as
Wisconsin history.

22
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,750
So, we can tell
the story of Wisconsin

23
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,999
in the context
of the United States.

24
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:55,500
- That's amazing.

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,999
Approximately--
and I know this may be hard
to give an exact number--

26
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,667
but approximately how many items
are you all storing

27
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:03,375
in this space currently?

28
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,417
- In this space, you're thinking
about archival materials,

libraries, and 3D artifacts,

We're in the couple
of hundreds of millions.

36
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,458

stored here.

With our first stop, we're

the sky and the air.

And this ultralight
is from Operation Migration

40
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,999
and it helped establish
the Whooping Crane

41

more firmly
in North America.

42

- And if you can imagine
a pilot wearing a bird costume.

44

So, we're really happy
to have it in the collection.

45
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,999
- From Wisconsin's
natural history,

46
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,333
Estella brought me
back on land

47
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,083
to check out Tesla's Dynamo,

48
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,999
a shawl Abraham Lincoln wore

while traveling
to his inauguration,

50
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,083
and a rich collection
of historical periodicals.

51
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,250
- Estella Chung: Here is
a anti-slavery publication

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,999
called "The Emancipator."

53
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:14,458
And if you look at this date
here, it dates to 1836.

54
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,875
So many interesting
things in here.
