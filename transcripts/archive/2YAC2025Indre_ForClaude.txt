1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,870
- My name is Indre Raghavan

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,806
and I'm a junior
at Middleton High School.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:10,377
I've been playing violin
since I was seven years old.

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:14,982
It can really showcase
the emotion that humans feel.

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:18,385
I'm half Indian,
half Lithuanian.

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,053
It's kind of cool to know that

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,856
I'm a part of so many
different cultures.

8
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,124
In the beginning of August,

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,859
my family always goes
to Lithuania,

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,395
and I get to see my cousins.

11
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,866
I've been a part of WYSO for a
little more than eight years.

12
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,067
- Kyle Knox: Okay, beat, ready?

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,136
Three and four and...

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,008
- Indre: Wisconsin Youth
Symphony Orchestras is a program

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,710
where kids at any level
will be put in orchestra

16
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,979
and they can learn
different skills.

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,382
- Now just feel the quarters
together.

18
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,250
- Indre: It's a really good
opportunity

19
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,953
just to immerse yourself
in other types of music

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,822
that you wouldn't play alone.

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,226
- Ria Hodgson:
Pepp-er-on-i piz-za.

22
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,961
[violin music]

23
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,499
- Indre: I'm a teen teacher
for WYSO Music Makers.

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,035
It's really cool
to work with younger kids

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,404
and just kind of take myself
back.

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,041
They're, like, full of curiosity
and I feel like that's so cool.

27
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,642
- Eugene Purdue: Okay,
start on the trill.

28
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,711
- Indre: I've been studying
with Mr. Purdue

29
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,813
for almost five years.

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,215
- Eugene: You know
the first question

31
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,382
I'm gonna ask you, right?

32
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,218
- Indre: He's definitely
helped me so much.

33
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,486
We're always, like,
working on intonation

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,055
and making sure
that you're, like,

35
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,224
representing yourself
in the piece.

36
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,059
And making sure that
it isn't, like,

37
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,762
you aren't just, like, copying
someone else's interpretation.

38
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,497
[violin music]

39
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,505
I started crossfit in 2020.

40
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,841
It's like, lifting and running
and box jumps

41
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,543
and, like, a bunch
of different things.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,711
- Keysha: Nice!

43
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,112
- Crossfit is, like,
a different way

44
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,214
for me to, like,
set goals for myself

45
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,149
because I feel that violin
is very subjective,

46
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,951
like, you don't know if you're
improving or not.

47
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,420
With crossfit, like, if you have
a heavier weight,

48
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,389
you know that you've improved.

49
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,724
- Higher, higher, faster!

50
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,492
- Keysha is definitely
supportive,

51
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,094
but she'll definitely be, like,
in your face

52
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,063
if you're not working as hard
as, like, she knows you can.

53
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,632
- [laughing] Keep going,
keep going.

54
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,269
- Indre: I always feel stronger
after.

55
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:21,041
I'll be playing Sibelius's
Violin Concerto in D minor,

56
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,709
first movement.

57
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,877
It starts out with, like,

58
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,880
a really icy kind of
arctic opening.

59
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,817
It kind of builds and becomes,
like, more fiery, more stormy,

60
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:36,089
and yeah, at the end, it's
kind of just like, everything!

61
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,893
I've already won, in my eyes,
just, like, being able to play.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,628
We've all won.

63
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,797
[ending note]

64
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,733
