1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
By the early modern
period in Europe,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,086
there was a big increase

3
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,172
in the production of maps explicitly
made for the purposes of navigation.

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,091
Now, in the areas around 
the Great Lakes,

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,010
which includes what is 
now Wisconsin,

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,511
the growing North American

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,930
fur trade was a big reason
for traveling to

8
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,931
and exploring the region.

9
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,476
This trade involved the exchange of 
goods between different cultures.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,896
Europeans brought items
like metal goods and textiles

11
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,441
and traded with native partners
for animal furs and skins.

12
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,444
Another big driver of charting this 
region during the 1700s

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,280
was the effort
to find a Northwest Passage.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,407
This was the hypothetical route
connecting the 

15
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,867
Atlantic and Pacific Ocean

16
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,994
 via a water passage 
above North America.

17
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,580
European explorers 
had no way of  knowing

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,290
if this was even 
really a possibility,

19
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,418
but that didn't stop many of them
from trying to find it.

20
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,671
In reality, the presence of 
sea ice and dangerous

21
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,341
waters made this route impractical,
if not outright impossible at the time.

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,093
But the efforts to find such a route

23
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,096
contributed to the mapping
of the northern part of the continent.
