[shimmery music]

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,303
- I'm in Oconto County,

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,673
cruising along
the local ATV and UTV trails,

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,908
learning about
what it takes

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,344
to keep these trails
safe for everyone.

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,612
[twangy, woodsy music]

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,147
[vehicle engine roaring]

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,751
My first stop was
to meet up with Randy Harden,

9
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,855
president of Wisconsin
ATV / UTV Association,

10
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,292
to chat about their work
supporting this growing sport.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,728
- Randy Harden: Wisconsin
ATV / UTV Association

12
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:31,698
is made up of
individual families, businesses,

13
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,500
clubs,
a lot of clubs,

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,303
about 120-plus local chapters
around the state,

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,174
and advocates that subscribe
to our, you know,

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,742
"Let's ride fun,
let's ride safe,

17
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,010
Let's do things
the right way."

18
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,745
And that's really
what we're all about.

19
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,013
- And it's important.

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,315
- It is.
It's a big sport.

21
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,151
There's close to half a million
machines now registered

22
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,120
both private and public.

23
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,723
Then we have
another 20... 25,000,
what we call non-residents,

24
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,760
where they come in and buy
a pass for five days or a year.

25
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,629
There's over 61,000 miles
of legal road routes

26
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,265
around Wisconsin that hook up
to our trail systems.

27
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,067
And that's what
makes up a network.

28
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,569
[vehicle engine roaring]

29
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,870
- That's impressive.

30
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,805
Can you tell us about
the significance of the work

31
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,973
the association does?

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,575
- Yeah, well, one
of our main jobs

33
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,943
is to help clubs,
our local clubs.

34
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,178
That's where everything happens
on the ground.

35
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,515
We provide tools, I guess tools
for their toolbox

36
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,550
and our
trail ambassador program.

37
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,720
We've got literally hundreds
of people that we've trained.

38
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,388
They go through
a certification.

39
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,524
Our ambassadors
are safety instructors

40
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,758
out on the trail,

41
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,560
but in a lighthearted way.

42
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,896
99% of the people are
just happy to say,

43
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,264
"Hey, I didn't know."

44
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,501
Or "Thanks for watching,"
so it's really a rewarding job.

45
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,936
- Wonderful, I'm glad to
hear that, it's, in general,

46
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,239
received pretty positively
by people.

47
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,975
- Randy: Our state organization
is functioning well,

48
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,544
but it wouldn't work
without our clubs.

49
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,979
- Angela: People like Jim,

50
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,149
president of a local club
here in Oconto County.

51
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,584
So, Jim,
tell us about your club.

52
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,286
- Jim Wisneski:
We have about 200,

53
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,821
I like to say,
"paying members,"

54
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:03,524
and probably if you count all
the spouses and the children,

55
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,492
there's probably
around 300, 400 people

56
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,894
in our local club here.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,896
- Angela: What should we expect
today on our ride?

58
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,265
- The first part of the ride
is gonna be pretty smooth

59
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,867
'cause we're gonna be
on Nicolet State Trail.

60
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,737
We have a lot of trails
off of the Nicolet Trail

61
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,672
that we're gonna
be going on today.

62
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,275
A lot of nice scenery,
a lot of nice trees,

63
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,410
wildlife, deer, bear.

64
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,280
We'll see
just about anything today.

65
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,514
We don't know.

66
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,982
- Angela: You said
we're gonna see bears, maybe?

67
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,018
- Possibly,
I'm not gonna guarantee it,

68
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,619
but there is bear--
- Okay.

69
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,955
- Up in this area.
- Okay, that's good to know.

70
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,157
Thank you, Jim.
- Sure.

71
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,393
- Angela: It was time
to buckle our seat belts

72
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,028
and hit the trails.

73
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,196

75

No bear sightings this time,
but a safe trip,

76
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,138
all thanks to the efforts
of local clubs

77
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:55,008
and the Wisconsin
ATV / UTV Association.
