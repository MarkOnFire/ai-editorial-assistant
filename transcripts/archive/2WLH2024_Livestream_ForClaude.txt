00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,917
The lighthouse keepers
were out there

373
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,750
in order to prevent accidents.

374
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,166
Catherine, she understood
the importance of the light,

375
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,333
and she did
what she could

376
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,250
in order to, you know,
to make it right.

377
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,999
- Bob Mackreth:
I think that shows
the level of dedication

378
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,667
that was fostered
in the culture.

379
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,875
The keepers
and their families,

380
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,917
the wife came in,
stepped in, and says,

381
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:07,917
"That's my responsibility,"

382
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:12,834
even right there
with the prospect of,
suddenly, widowhood.

383
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,291
So, it's a reason
I admire these people.

390
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,333
>> Hi, I'm James Steinbach. I'm
a volunteer here at PBS

391
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,875
a volunteer here at PBS
Wisconsin. Taking just a quick

392
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,500
break from this remarkable
program. And you know, the

393
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,625
lighthouses have a special place
in our imagination of course,

394
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,041
and also in the history of the
state. And this is something

395
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,250
which I thought I knew a little
bit about lighthouses. But

396
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,291
watching this program and
looking at the book that it was

397
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,500
based on is really a great way
to understand much more about

398
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,834
not just the lighthouses, but
the people who kept them, the

399
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:04,000
families that lived there, the
people who made this work, the

400
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,125
people who were dedicated to
saving lives. And that's what

401
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,208
it's all about. And this program
here is an important thing. This

402
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,959
program was made right here at
PBS Wisconsin with a producer

403
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:16,208
from the station, which is
routine of course, for us to do

404
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,250
these great shows. But every
time a new one comes up, like

405
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,583
this, which is about Wisconsin,
I think this is only going to

406
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,999
happen here at PBS Wisconsin. No
place else is going to do this.

407
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,458
And for that, it's worth my
support. And I think yours too.

408
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,750
Call us at 1-800-236-3636.

409
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:36,709
>> Well, thank you James. I'm
Kerman Eckes I'm on the staff

410
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,375
here at Wisconsin Public
Television and I am so excited

411
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,333
to be part of bringing this
Wisconsin Lighthouses to you

412
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,917
this evening and to give you
this opportunity to show your

413
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:50,375
support for us here. And when
you do, we have some wonderful,

414
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,250
wonderful thank you gifts. Let
me run through those briefly for

415
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,750
you right now. If you can join
us at the $15 a month donation

416
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,375
level, you have your choice of
three absolutely fantastic

417
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:03,000
items. First of all, you can
choose the copy of the show that

418
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,959
we've just that we're watching
right now. Wisconsin

419
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,999
Lighthouses. So you can go back
and see that wonderful footage

420
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,625
again and hear those stories
again that James was talking

421
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,583
about, about the people that
made lighthouses so real and so

422
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,625
important for us here at the
State of Wisconsin. Or you can

423
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,208
choose the book that the show is
based on. Again, that's

424
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:24,583
Wisconsin Lighthouses by Ken.
And Barb Wardius, and fantastic

425
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,750
book. I've been paging through
it and there are the photos are

426
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,999
wonderful. There's so many
different stories. So much more

427
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:34,000
in depth information that you
can get. So that's a wonderful

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
thing that you can choose or
finally, the third thing is this

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,834
great tote bag and it's a nice
heavy weight and it has the Cana

430
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:47,041
Island Lighthouse in the day in
the daytime on one side and then

431
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,250
in the evening when it's lit up
on the other side. So it's

432
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,166
perfect for the beach or
whatever you want to do. If you

433
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,500
would like all three of these
things, then call and become a

434
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,792
member this evening at the $25
a month level, and we will send

435
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,000
you the DVD, t he book, and the
tote bag. So we have many ways

436
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,999
to say thank you to you for
joining us, but now we need you

437
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,792
to go to those phones and dial
1-800-236-3636.

438
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:14,333
>> Hi, I'm David Hoffert, a
volunteer here at PBS Wisconsin,

439
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,999
and I want to pick up on
something James just said about.

440
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:20,999
No one else besides PBS
Wisconsin would make a show like

441
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,959
this. I'm sure there are
documentaries about lighthouses

442
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,667
out there right? But there
probably, I don't know, New

443
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,500
England lighthouses. And yet, as
this show talks about the great

444
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,625
Lakes, really these inland seas,
right, are are such an important

445
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,667
part of the history of this
country and such an important

446
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:41,500
part of the story of Wisconsin.
And so what this program is

447
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,667
really doing is, is capturing
that history that story for us

448
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,999
to remember and enjoy and
appreciate for generations to

449
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:53,000
come. And it's a lot of work,
right? This this program took

450
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,417
years to make between the
research and the filming and the

451
00:21:56,417 --> 00:22:00,667
interviewing, the experts and
the editing, it's a big deal to

452
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,375
get something like this over the
finish line and we're able to do

453
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,583
that at PBS Wisconsin because we
know that you have our back and

454
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,667
that's what happens when you
call 1-800-236-3636.

455
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:17,875
>> One of the things that I
really love about PBS Wisconsin

456
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:22,208
is that we can take you places
that you wouldn't be able to get

457
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,166
to. Perhaps on your own either,
because you have little children

458
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,000
that can't get in there or
because you're not able yourself

459
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,417
And the lighthouse on Rock
Island is a great example of

460
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:37,417
that, because you may not make
that trek. You may not be able

461
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:40,709
to do that, but you can go there
with PBS Wisconsin and you can

462
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,834
go there with this terrific
book, which is from the from

463
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,999
from Ken and Barb Wardius. And
this book is the basis for the

464
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,250
program that you're watching
now. It's a beautiful book,

465
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,542
beautifully researched, really
in-depth research. You know, a

466
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:59,750
friend of mine talks about TV
shows as the executive summary

467
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,166
way that's true. The show,
wonderful as it is, doesn't go

468
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:07,000
into anywhere near the detail
But it can still bring you to a

469
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
place, invite you to share it,
and you can share it with your

470
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,291
kids and with your family. So
that's worth something. Call us

471
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:18,500
now at one (800) 236-3636.
>> Hi, I'm Eric Greiling,

472
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,208
director of friends of PBS
Wisconsin. Ken and Barb, thanks

473
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,250
for coming to in the PBS
Wisconsin studios. Thank you

474
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,375
Eric. We've been enjoying your
book Wisconsin Lighthouses a

475
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:33,542
photographic and historical
guide. So tell us what inspired

476
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:38,458
your interest in lighthouses?
>> Oh my goodness. Over 40 years

477
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,166
ago we visited Cana Island
Lighthouse in Door County, and

478
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:45,999
we were hooked on the place.
Just a magical place. We wanted

479
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:50,000
to learn more about the history
and the people, especially who

480
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,834
tended the light. So it all
started for from a request from

481
00:23:54,834 --> 00:24:00,125
our friends, go visit Cana
Island and we did. And we've

482
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,208
been back dozens and dozens of
times since.

483
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,250
>> So it started with Cana
Island. Do you know how many

484
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,999
lighthouses you've visited?
>> Well, all of them in

485
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,917
Wisconsin, all 48.
>> And how many times?

486
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:16,458
>> Some only once. And some. Oh,
multiple times multiple times,

487
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,667
yeah.
>> And how did it become a

488
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,999
shared project for both of you?
Was it just something you

489
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:25,208
arrived at together?
>> Yeah, it kind of was by

490
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,999
accident. Barb and I neither one
of us are writers. We always had

491
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:32,834
a camera when we traveled around
the state, just mostly snapshot

492
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:37,375
for family type photos. As we
visited a lighthouse or two, we

493
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,417
took some pictures, some friends
of ours said, hey, you got

494
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:44,834
really nice pictures here. Why
don't you write a book? We knew

495
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:49,999
no better again, neither one of
us are experts in that. But Barb

496
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:53,999
and I have always been a team on
a lot of things that we do, and

497
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:57,999
it just went went from there.
>> Well, that's great. Was it

498
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,875
very difficult to research this
book?

499
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,583
>> The research took a lot of
time. We were still working at

500
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:07,208
the time when we did all the
research, so it would be after

501
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,500
work at night, doing that. And
the internet isn't what it is

502
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,709
now, which is fine. We had more
luck and more accurate

503
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:16,083
information from descendants,
historical societies, libraries

504
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:19,709
that would furnish us with
information great great.

505
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:22,999
>> Well, we're going to hear
more from Barb and Ken

506
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,875
throughout the program. And
right now we're going to go back

507
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,500
and please make a call and show
your support for Wisconsin

508
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,959
Lighthouses and we'd like to say
thank you with a gift of

509
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:35,375
Wisconsin Lighthouses.
>> Well, it was absolutely

510
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,709
fabulous to hear that. That part
of that interview with Ken and

511
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:42,208
Barb Wardius, the authors of the
book Wisconsin Lighthouses there

512
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,000
will be hearing more from them
later on. But in the meantime,

513
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,583
we have plenty of time for you
right now to go to the phones

514
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,417
and talk to one of our
volunteers and also take take

515
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,542
part in some of these wonderful
thank you gifts that we can send

516
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:59,999
you when you join us as a member
of PBS Wisconsin. So if you join

517
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,999
us at the $15 a month level, you
have your choice of one of three

518
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:07,333
items you can pick up the DVD or
Blu ray of the show that we've

519
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,333
been watching. Wisconsin
Lighthouses. Or you can take a

520
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:13,208
copy of the book that everything
is based on. With all those

521
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,750
great illustrations and extra
stories or for your third

522
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,709
choice, you can take the
wonderful tote bag that we have.

523
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,458
The nice large sized tote bag
with illustrations of the Cana

524
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:25,875
Island Lighthouse at night and
during the daytime. So wonderful

525
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,250
gifts at that level. You could
also join us at the $25 a month

526
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,999
level. And we will send you all
three of those. So you'll get

527
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:37,208
the book, the DVD, and the tote
bag. But I want to spend a

528
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,375
little time talking about a very
special gift level that would be

529
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,625
perfect for the young. The
youngster in your life, and

530
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,417
that's if you join us at the $20
a month level. We will send you

531
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,041
a copy of the book. Hello
lighthouse. This is by Sophie

532
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,291
Blackall and it is an absolutely
gorgeous book. I've been having

533
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,625
a chance to page through it.
Wonderful, wonderful

534
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,542
illustrations in this book. A
perfect to fire the imagination

535
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:03,291
of the youngster in your life.
But to come with that we also

536
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,583
have this wonderful night light.
And if you look at that

537
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,834
nightlight, you can see it has
this wonderful illustration of a

538
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:12,999
lighthouse in the daytime. But
then at night the lights come on

539
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,500
and the lighthouse and I just
love this. And then again in the

540
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
daytime it will go back to the
daytime view. Wonderful for any

541
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,083
youngster in your life. So
again, that's at that $20 a

542
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,999
month level. So we have many
different things to encourage

543
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,625
you to join us this evening.
Like the people that already

544
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,875
have. If you're one of those
thank you. So much. If you're

545
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:38,750
not, if you haven't done that
yet, please give us a call at

546
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,750
one (800) 236-3636. You know, I
have to say, I have a youngster

547
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,083
in my life and Berman was
letting me page through the book

earlier.
sustaining member at the $20 a

like this could be kismet,

550
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,999
right? But but I'll I'll deal
with that after I'm done. I'm

551
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,999
done talking to you. You know, I
think what matters most about a

552
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:01,667
program like this and a pledge
break like this, is that you

553
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,959
feel a sense of ownership of
this kind of programing on PBS

554
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:08,667
Wisconsin, and you want to
support it, and you find the

555
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,834
level that's right for you.
Maybe it's one of the gift

556
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:13,999
packages. Kerman Eckes was
talking about. Maybe it's just

557
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:18,750
making a donation to PBS
Wisconsin. What matters is that

558
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:29,999
support at one (800) 236-3636.

Sand Island is on the western

So, it's way out there.

If the weather conditions
aren't right,
you aren't landing.

to get off the island,
you're not getting off.

The lake is the boss,
definitely.

568
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,375
- Bob Mackreth:
The lighthouse at Sand Island

569
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,291
was there primarily
to give warning to ships

570
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,542
to stay off the Apostles.

574
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,583
- Bob Mackreth:
Sand Island Lighthouse

575
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,917
was fashioned
from the fabric of the island.

576
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,291
It's a beautiful building,

577
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:34,375
which was built
from the rock where it sits.

578
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:38,041
And I can't think of
a more intimate way
or profound way

579
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:42,999
that a building can be connected

keeper at Sand Island

586
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,000
I find an interesting fellow
for a number of reasons.

587
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,917
His name was
Emmanuel Luick.

588
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:09,208
He came there
for the 1892 season,

589
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,625
and then stayed 28 years

590
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:14,417
until the lighthouse
was automated in 1920.

591
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,667
- Barb Wardius: Mr. Luick
enjoyed lighthouse keeping.

592
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:20,667
- Bob Mackreth:
Loved it; he thrived
in the lighthouse life.

593
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,999
He spent
his first couple of years

594
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,875
out at Sand Island
all by himself.

595
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,667
Then, in 1896,

596
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:33,583
he married a young woman
named Ella Gertrude Richardson.

597
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,625
She was from
Providence, Rhode Island.

601
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,667
- Bob Mackreth:
She was enraptured

602
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,999
by his promises
to live in a lighthouse.

603
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:52,458
And I'm sure
it sounded very romantic.

604
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,458
- Neil Howk: Being in
a beautiful setting,

605

in a lovely building,
it's great.

All lighthouse keepers

611
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,917
were required to keep
a daily log book,

612
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,750

one line

614

ships that had passed.

if there was painting
or gardening going on.

on the other hand,

618
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,999
used it basically
as a personal diary.

619
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,208
We have
a very complete picture

620
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,999

falling apart.

624
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,709
- Barb Wardius: But again,
she was 16 years old.

625
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:46,083
She just found lighthouse life
very lonely.

Emmanuel is not Mr. Charm.
[chuckles]

631
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,125
It appears
he was hard to get along with.

632
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:11,000
He went through assistant
keepers at a fairly rapid clip.

633
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,417
And he didn't have
a really good reputation.

634
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,333
But on the other hand,

635
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,583
he was an incredibly talented
photographer.

636
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:24,041
Several years ago we discovered
a treasure trove of photos

637
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,417
that Luick took.

638
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,999
They'd been sitting
in a barn.

639
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,417
And this would be
the first time

640
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:31,625
anyone had eyes on those photos
in decades.

641
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,125
- Neil Howk:
Several hundred images.

642
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,625
Some of the images are from
the lighthouse on Sand Island

643
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,458
and what it was like
to be a lighthouse keeper.

644
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:44,999
- Bob Mackreth:
Excellent shots of the
lighthouse and the surroundings,

645
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,417
which are quite artistic.

646
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:49,083

<i>He meticulously documented
 life along Lake Superior.</i>

651
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,583
- Bob Mackreth:
He had a very good eye

652
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,834
for catching a personality.

653
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:12,125
And they are
so sharp and vivid.

654
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:15,500
<i>- Luick was able to evoke
 a sense of beauty</i>

this is the premiere. So this is

00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,208
possible for us to do this
program and all the programs

959
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,709
that you enjoy. Some are
national that we bring in, but

960
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:04,458
many of them are local programs,
whether they're documentaries or

961
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,667
histories or news and public
affairs, like here. And now.

962
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:10,999
This is something which every
week you can count on programs

963
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:15,083
from PBS Wisconsin that will
take you places you may not have

964
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:18,999
been. We'll reveal things you
may not have thought about.

965
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,041
That's really worth something,
especially during this challenge

966
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:25,333
break. We want 50 calls. We're
at 11. We can do better than

967
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:31,709
that. Give us a call one
(800) 236-3636.

968
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:34,458
don't forget when you do call
and join us as a member of PBS

969
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:37,250
Wisconsin this evening. We have
some. Thank you gifts that we

970
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,999
can send you your way at. If you
join us at that $15 a month

971
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:44,999
level, you have your choice of
three different items. You can

972
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:48,250
take a copy either in DVD or Blu
ray of the show that we've been

973
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,667
watching. So a great way to go
back and visit the visit. Those

974
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,999
lighthouses once again. Or you
can take a copy of the book by

975
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:57,125
Ken and Barbara's Wisconsin
Lighthouses. And this is the

976
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:00,999
book that everything is based
on. So much more in depth.

977
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,417
Writing about the different
historical and current day

978
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,583
pictures of the lighthouses. So
that's a wonderful addition to

979
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:11,041
your library. Or you can choose
this beautiful tote. It's a nice

980
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,375
large sized tote, a heavy canva,
and it's a great way to show

981
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:18,000
your support. So talk to one of
our volunteers about that and

982
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,291
they can help you on your way to
becoming a member. In the

983
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:24,291
meantime, we're going to go back
and see some more of the

984
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,625
interview with Ken and
Barbatteius. They have some

985
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:29,291
great more great information
about the creation of their boo.

986
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:33,417
Wisconsin Lighthouses. So here's
Ken and Barb.

987
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:36,542
>> Hi, I'm Eric Greiling,
director of friends of PBS

988
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:40,250
Wisconsin. We're back in the
studio with Ken and Barb. Your

989
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,999
book was really important to our
research, to make this

990
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,583
documentary Wisconsin
Lighthouses, and it really is a

991
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:51,542
companion to the documentary.
Can you give us a bit of an

992
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:55,000
overview of your book?
>> Oh, it's broken down

993
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,208
geographically to different
sections of Wisconsin Lake

994
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:02,208
Superior Lake Winnebago. We had
no idea there were lighthouses

995
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:06,000
on Lake Winnebago when we began
our research. And then all the

996
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
rest of the lighthouses are on
some portion of Lake Michigan.

997
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,834
One one portion is called the
Bay of Green Bay, and then the

998
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:17,291
rest of the coastline all the
way down to the state line in

999
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:22,709
Lake Michigan are there some
highlights of the book you'd

1000
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:25,125
like to call out?
>> Any special features?

1001
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,041
>> One of our favorite stories
involves the Lueck family at

1002
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:30,333
Sand Island Lighthouse. Emmanuel
Luke was the keeper there, and

1003
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:35,999
he brought his bride, Miss Ella,
at 16 years of age, to live on

1004
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:38,041
the island with him. Well,
lighthouse life was difficult.

1005
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:43,625
She lasted about ten years and
left Mr. Lueck went out east,

1006
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,750
remarried and became a
registered nurse, but don't

1007
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,583
despair, Mr. Luke found love and
did remarry and have two

1008
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,999
children on sand Island, and
that's not the only story about

1009
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:56,458
a woman being in a lighthouse or
a lighthouse keeper.

1010
00:51:56,458 --> 00:52:00,875
>> Is it? No, no, it's not Barb
and I grew up in Milwaukee.

1011
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:05,250
There's a lighthouse in Lake
Park, Milwaukee, North Point

1012
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,999
Light. When we went there to do
research, we learned of a lady

1013
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:13,792
by the name of Georgia Stebbins.
Once we learned a little bit of

1014
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:19,375
her story, fascinating woman, a
head lighthouse keeper for over

1015
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,792
30 years at Milwaukee North
Point. That was very, very rare

1016
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:28,999
during that era. Just a fabulou,
hard working mother, wife and

1017
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:32,667
lighthouse keeper and we're
going to hear more about Georgia

1018
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:35,834
Stebbins in this next segment.
>> So let's go back to the

1019
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:39,208
program. We'll come back to Barb
and Ken later. And if you want

1020
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:42,917
to have a copy of Wisconsin
Lighthouses as your thank you

1021
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:49,709
gift, please give us a call at
one (800) 236-3636.

1022
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:53,041
challenge break. Our goal is 50
calls. We're at 31. But I bet

1023
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:55,999
we're actually at more than that
because the phone lines are

1024
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:59,417
busy. If you are currently
waiting to get through please

1025
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:03,999
stay on the line. You can also
go to pbswisconsin.org, but your

1026
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:06,250
call will be answered and it
will count towards that

1027
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,250
challenge break. We just need a
little patience because there is

1028
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,458
a great response, which of
course is incredible. We just

1029
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:15,875
heard a bunch of information
about the stories in this book.

1030
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:18,458
I want to point out. It's also
just a great like road trip

1031
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:24,041
guide, right? My wife and I have
hosted exchange students for a

1032
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:27,625
these epic road trips and we've
been saying we should do more in

1033
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:30,458
Wisconsin. What a great
opportunity to kind of have a

1034
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:35,959
have ideas planted of where we
should go and what we should

1035
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:38,125
explore right in our own
backyard. But whatever your

1036
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:41,917
motivation, maybe it's the book,
maybe it's supporting a program

1037
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:47,542
like this. We are now up to 36
calls going for 50. Give us a

1038
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:52,834
call one (800) 236-3636.
>> You know, PBS Wisconsin is

1039
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,917
all about Wisconsin. That's what
we're here for. That's why it's

1040
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:59,999
in our name. And you know, if
you think about the programs

1041
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:02,875
that carry the name, you know,
Wisconsin from the air Wisconsin

1042
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:07,291
Hometown Stories Wisconsin
It's because we are focused

1043
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,583
resolutely laser focused on
Wisconsin stories. And in fact,

1044
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,999
Wisconsin stories. There we go.
So that's something which you

1045
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:16,500
can really count on. And is
different from any other

1046
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,125
station. Certainly because
they're not in Wisconsin. But

1047
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:22,750
even with that, we do an
extraordinary amount of local

1048
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,667
production and production that
is for us by us, about us. This

1049
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,999
program is a terrific example of
that. And it's made possible

1050
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:34,750
because generations of folks
have supported PBS Wisconsin and

1051
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,667
I kind of think of it because
there was a time when I was not

1052
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:41,999
able to support something like
this, and now I can and I think

1053
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:43,999
about the people now who are
watching and enjoying, and

1054
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:47,458
they'd like to do it, but maybe
they just can't do it now. And

1055
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:51,999
so my contribution is sort of a
way of paying it forward for,

1056
00:54:51,999 --> 00:55:00,999
for the time that they will do
break. If you can, at one

1057
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:03,583
(800) 236-3636.
was just saying about paying it

1058
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:07,999
forward. I like I'm a member of
PBS Wisconsin and I like to

1059
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:11,166
think that when I do that, I'm
helping to bring all of these

1060
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,291
shows to people all across the
state. And to me, that's

1061
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,542
something that's very important.
So if that's something that's

1062
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:19,667
important to you, call us right
now during this challenge break

1063
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:22,709
and we will put your your pledge
of support to work immediately.

1064
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:25,583
And we'll also send you some
wonderful thank you gifts and

1065
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:28,999
let me run through these again
briefly. If you join us at that

1066
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:31,999
$15 level, a month, the $15 a
month level, you have your

1067
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:35,000
choice of three different items.
You can have a copy of the DVD

1068
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,208
or Blu ray of the show that
we've been watching. Or you can

1069
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:42,625
have a copy of the book, which
again, is this fabulous book.

1070
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,999
Wisconsin Lighthouses by Ken and
Barb Wardius. We've been hearing

1071
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:48,125
from them and the book I like
what David said about it being a

1072
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,291
it could be a road guide for you
as you're touring Wisconsin and

1073
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:54,750
looking at lighthouses, but no
matter how you use it, it's a

1074
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,208
fabulous book and it's something
you'll want in your library. Or

1075
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:00,999
you can choose to take this
beautiful canvas tote. It's a

1076
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,500
nice large sized tote on one
side side. It has the Cana

1077
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,875
Island Lighthouse at night and
on the other side is the Cane

1078
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,875
Island Lighthouse. At daytime.
So these are all great. Or you

1079
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:13,750
can take all three of these if
you call and become a member at

1080
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,999
the $25 a month level or so.
That's something you can

1081
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:20,583
consider. Then we also have one
special level that I'd like to

1082
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:23,625
talk to you about. And this is
for $20 a month. And we're

1083
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,458
calling it kind of the
children's level because it

1084
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:28,500
includes a fabulous book called
Hello Lighthouse with

1085
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,500
illustrations by Sophie Sophie
Blackall and the illustrations

1086
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,792
are absolutely beautiful, but
the story is beautiful too. It

1087
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,458
tells about a lighthouse keeper
that comes. It talks about the

1088
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:42,500
day to day life in the
lighthouse, the lighthouse

1089
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,709
keeper's family comes. There are
good things that happen and bad

1090
00:56:45,709 --> 00:56:48,999
things that happen. So this is a
fabulous book. But we also

1091
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:52,083
include this wonderful
nightlight and the nightlight is

1092
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,333
in the daytime. It's a
lighthouse in the daytime. And

1093
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:59,250
then when the lights go out, the
lights come up on the on the

1094
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,792
lighthouse in the in the
nightlight. So I think it's

1095
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:06,333
absolutely any child would love
this. I would love to have this

1096
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,542
nightlight at my house. I just
think it's absolutely wonderful.

1097
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:15,291
But you would get that that book
and the and the nightlight for

1098
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:18,333
$20 a month. So we have many
ways to say thank you to you

1099
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:22,417
when you join us here at PBS
Wisconsin. But it starts with

1100
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:26,083
you going to the phone and
dialing one (800) 236-3636.

1101
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:29,125
>> So I don't know if you caught
that right. As the camera cut

1102
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:32,041
away from Kermit, but we have
reached our goal of 50 calls.

1103
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:35,917
We're at 52. That's okay. The
challenge break continues and

1104
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:40,208
your donation will still be
matched. We're going to we're

1105
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:43,875
going to bump up the goal. Let's
say 70 calls during this break.

1106
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:48,999
It's really incredible to see
the level of excitement that we

1107
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:53,999
have for such a unique program
like this. Now I have to admit,

1108
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:57,083
one of my favorite experiences
watching PBS Wisconsin is I come

1109
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:01,834
home. I just, you know, sit down
on the couch, turn on the TV. I

1110
00:58:01,834 --> 00:58:05,999
have no idea what to expect, but
I turn to PBS Wisconsin and just

1111
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:08,166
I just get sucked in. Right.
There's something so compelling,

1112
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:12,250
so interesting that I'm just
there. That's a pretty cool

1113
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,999
experience. It's also a cool
experience to have known in

1114
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:18,999
advance. So, for example, if you
had your "Airwaves" magazine,

1115
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,999
you wouldn't even have to open
it this time. You'd just be on

1116
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,083
the cover. You would know that
this premiere was happening

1117
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,166
tonight. That's one of the
member benefits you get when you

1118
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:31,083
donate any amount to PBS
Wisconsin of course, you might

1119
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:33,917
also be interested in those
thank you gifts, but we are

1120
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:39,542
going for 70 calls. We're at 55.
Give us a call one

1121
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:43,083
(800) 236-3636.
the next segment of the

1122
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,750
lighthouses show Wisconsin
Lighthouses in just a minute.

1123
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,041
But one thing that you may not
know is that even after the

1124
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,709
program is done, there's an
opportunity to explore in depth.

1125
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:56,917
If you go to the PBS Wisconsin
website, you'll be able to see a

1126
00:58:56,917 --> 00:59:00,875
virtual tour of the Cana light,
which lets you inside the light,

1127
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:04,000
and also you can walk up the
stairs without actually walking

1128
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,999
up the stairs, which is kind of
cool, especially if you're not

1129
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:10,583
going to be able to get there.
Maybe tomorrow. So you can go

1130
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,999
and check that out. This is the
kind of thing that is important

1131
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:17,959
to us at PBS Wisconsin. The
program is important, but the

1132
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:21,999
program is a way for us to give
you something of value. And when

1133
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:24,999
there are things in addition
that we can do, like that, like

1134
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:27,375
this virtual tour or the
educational programs that we

1135
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:30,959
that we provide for schools and
teachers, whether it's

1136
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:33,125
homeschool or public schools or
private schools or parents at

1137
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:37,291
home, these are really important
pieces of what PBS Wisconsin

1138
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:41,458
does. It's not it's not just TV
anymore. It's pretty broad, but

1139
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:45,208
at the heart of it, at the heart
of it are these extraordinary

1140
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:49,625
programs and right now, during
at 63 on our way to 70, keep on

1141
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,166
calling. If you get if you don't
get through right away, stick

1142
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:58,959
with it. Call us at one

Wisconsin, we have some fabulous

1144
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,250
thank you gifts. Let me very
quickly run through these for

1145
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:08,125
you. If you call and become a
member at the $15 a month level,

1146
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:11,000
you have your choice of three
different items. You can take a

1147
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,999
copy of either a DVD or Blu ray
of Wisconsin Lighthouses. The

1148
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:18,375
wonderful program that we're
watching this evening, or you

1149
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:21,625
can take a copy of the book
Wisconsin Lighthouses by Ken and

1150
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:24,000
Barbatteius. This is where
everything came from. This is

1151
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,208
the inspiration for the program
that we've been watching or you

1152
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,417
can also have this wonderful
canvas tote, and it's a nice

1153
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:34,792
heavyweight canvas tote. But
what really makes it stand out

1154
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:37,041
are these beautiful
illustrations. These are also by

1155
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:42,959
Sophie Blackall, the wonderful
artist that has done so much for

1156
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:46,875
us here at PBS Wisconsin. But on
one side is the Cana Island

1157
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,458
Lighthouse in the daytime and on
the other side is the Cane

1158
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:52,333
Island Lighthouse at night. So
it's an absolutely beautiful

1159
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:55,999
tote. If you would like all
three of those items, call and

1160
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:59,208
become a member at the $25 a
month level and we will send you

1161
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:03,667
the DVD. The book, and the tote.
And don't forget, we have that

1162
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:07,083
special children's level as well
that features the copy of the

1163
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:10,208
with those by Sophie Blackall,
and that nightlight. So many,

1164
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,417
many thank you gifts. Our
volunteers can go over those

1165
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:17,999
again with you. So give them a
call at one (800) 236-3636.

1166
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:22,000

to the program to the to the

1167
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,792
final segment of the program
tonight we just hit our goal of

1168
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:29,083
70 calls. But keep calling as
long as you are waiting to talk

1169
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:32,999
to a volunteer. When the program
resumes, your gift will be

1170
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:36,999
doubled. Making a program like
this is a risk, right? What if

1171
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:40,250
people don't want it? Well,
clearly you do. That's really

1172
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:44,667
important to know. Give us a
call one (800) 236-3636.

The thing that strikes me
about Wisconsin lighthouses is

1176
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:08,375
the variety.

1177
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,750
Different sizes,
shapes, colors.

1178
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:15,083
There's a lot
of really unique lighthouses.

If you think about how people

1192
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:53,667
look at landmarks
when you're on the road,

1193
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:54,917
they had landmarks
on the lake.

1194
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:56,375
- Kevin Osgood:
They would climb trees

1195
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:59,125
and they would cut
maybe half the branches off

1196
01:02:59,125 --> 01:02:59,999
from the ground up.

1197
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,000
Those are known
as "lob trees."

1198
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Each of those
meant something:

either turn left here
or turn right there.

Go east, go west,
go north.

1243
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:59,291
- Michael Gasperi:
What Poe really brought was

1244
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:03,083
a much more substantial,
brighter, taller structure

1245
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,959
than what
had been here before.

1246

<i>- The soaring tower

[playful, dreamy melody]

1253

At Wind Point,

01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,999
you can stand at the base
and look up,

They could have just been

actuallylightly shaped.

1263
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,458
It's unexpectedly simple,

1264

<i>post-Civil War.</i>

1269
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:12,542
- Barb Wardius:
The time that Wind Point

1270
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:15,500
was built in the 1880s
and put into service

1271
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,583
was a boom time
for Wisconsin.

1272
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,750
- Brendon Baillod:
On the Great Lakes,

01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,417
there were more vessels
per square mile

1274

than any place else
in the world.

1275
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:27,999
<i>- Lake Michigan
 was filled with steamships</i>

1276
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:30,417
<i>and enormous
 straight-deck freighters.</i>

1277
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:33,875
<i>They were overflowing

<i>grain.</i>

1279
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:38,333
- Brendon Baillod:
"Prairie Gold,"
as they called it.

1280
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,291
That was
where the money was.

1281
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:42,999
Almost all grain that was
being consumed on the East Coast

1282
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,458
was coming
out of Wisconsin.

1283
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:48,999
Lighthouses were just essential
to protect those investments.

1284
01:06:48,999 --> 01:06:52,750
<i>- Wind Point was chosen

<i>The rapidly developing region</i>

1288
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:03,999
<i>It was welcoming
 scores of new residents.</i>

1289
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:06,291
- Brendon Baillod:
Lake Michigan
was an early target

1290
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:07,999
for immigrants
from Europe.

1291
01:07:07,999 --> 01:07:10,709

Buffalo, New York.

1293

They arrived on
paddlewheel ships and steamers.

1294
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:19,291
You know, the immigrant story
of the late 19th century.

1295
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:22,125
They would come
to Wisconsin.

<i>After a harrowing trip

[uplifting piano]

1314
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,999

When you saw the lighthouse

1315
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:15,166
at Manitowoc or Sheboygan,

1316
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:17,999
you had reached
your destination,

1317
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:20,750
and there had to be
a sigh of relief.

1318
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,999
- Albert Muchka: The idea
that the ship captain

1319
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:24,834
knew where he was going.

1320

In a storm,
you knew there was land here.

North Point Lighthouse

1344
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,166
is actually
a compilation

1345
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:35,750
of parts

1346

<i>- Originally constructed

1347
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,041
<i>severe erosion

<i>!jeopardized the brick structure.</i>

1349
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:49,208
<i>In 1888, a new cast-iron tower
!was built a hundred feet inland,</i>

1350
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:53,542
<i>!with the lantern of the original
 lighthouse placed on top.</i>

<i>But by the turn
 of the 20th century,</i>

1352
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:59,999
<i>North Point
 needed yet another upgrade.</i>

1353
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:03,000
- Mark Kuehn: What do you do
when you design a park?

1354
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,917
You plant trees.

1355
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,333
Well, by 1911,
the treeline's too high.

1356
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:07,333
You can't see
the lighthouse anymore.

1357
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:09,417
<i>- The solution

1361
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,208
- Ken Wardius:
If you look at
the current lighthouse

1362

at North Point today,

1363
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,583
there's actually
a seam in the middle

1364
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,208
that differentiates
the new base,

1365

from the top half,

1367
01:10:25,999 --> 01:10:31,792

from the tower built in 1888.

<i>- The unconventional history

1369

1371

1373
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:52,250
- Mark Kuehn: In 1873,
Georgia was living in New York.

1374
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,417
She gave birth
to two daughters,

1375

but she lost them
in childbirth and illness.

1376
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:58,458
Then, she was informed
that she had tuberculosis.

1377
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:01,875
The doctor said,
"The only chance you have

1378
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,208
"is to get
out of New York

1379
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,792

1384
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:17,667

and hopefully get better.

1386

01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:38,208
is the artwork. That's on the
tote itself. The artwork is done

1684
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:42,750
by artist Sophie Blackall and
she has done a beautiful

1685
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:46,750
illustration of Cana Island
Lighthouse in the daytime on one

1686
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:49,917
side, and then on the other side
is the Cana Island Lighthouse.

1687
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:53,667
At night. So absolutely
beautiful tote a great way if

1688
01:25:53,667 --> 01:25:56,166
you're into lighthouses. This is
something that you're going to

1689
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:59,917
want to add to your collection.
Or you can get all three of

1690
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:05,041
these with a commitment at $25 a
month here for PBS Wisconsin. So

1691
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:08,999
it all starts with you going to
your phone and dialing

1692
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:14,125
1-(800) 236-3636.
>> And I'm David Hoffert. I'm a

1693
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:17,458
volunteer here at PBS Wisconsin,
and I get to say, but wait,

1694
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:20,999
there's more because there's
another gift level that I didn't

1695
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:24,750
have time to talk about. They're
right in between the two. At $20

1696
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,959
a month, where you get more of
that. Sophie Blackall art. So

1697
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:31,834
this is a children's book. Hello
Lighthouse, with a lot of her

1698
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:37,041
illustrations and also a
nightlight. And this is the this

1699
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:40,792
is the same artwork that was on
the tote bag that Kerman was

1700
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:42,999
just showing you. This one's
pretty cool though, because it's

1701
01:26:42,999 --> 01:26:46,709
the daytime artwork now, and
if it got dark, it

1702
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:50,208
would be the nighttime artwork
on that same bag. And this is

1703
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:55,542
art that that Sophie Blackall
made for PBS Wisconsin for this,

1704
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:57,999
that tote bag and that
nightlight. You cannot get that

1705
01:26:57,999 --> 01:27:01,041
anywhere else. So this is a
great time to show your support.

1706
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:04,500
Give us a call.
1-(800) 236-3636.

1707
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,999
>> So in this last segment we
were watching, we heard the

1708
01:27:07,999 --> 01:27:11,834
story of Georgia Stebbins and
this is a woman you saw the

1709
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:15,500
show. You know that. Who
dedicated her life to keeping

1710
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:19,041
the light. And she stayed there.
What did it say? She stayed

1711
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:23,041
there never spending a night
away from the lighthouse. Never

1712
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:25,667
spending a night away from the
lighthouse. Is that the

1713
01:27:25,667 --> 01:27:30,792
dedication of that is really
worth knowing and telling these

1714
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:34,000
stories. Telling these stories
about Wisconsin folks who you

1715
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,208
may never have heard of, who
have done these extraordinary

1716
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:40,999
things. It's one of the things
that I really value about PBS

1717
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:43,250
Wisconsin. It's great to have
the celebrities and all the

1718
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:46,417
things that we do when we do
music. But the greatest thing is

1719
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:49,583
when we see our neighbors and
our friends and the histories

1720
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:52,792
from the past that really reveal
to us something about where

1721
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:55,999
we've come from and perhaps
where we're going as well,

1722
01:27:55,999 --> 01:27:59,375
because it all connects. And I
think that that's something that

1723
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:03,583
PBS Wisconsin really celebrates
and encourages you and engages

1724
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:08,750
you and invites you to share. So
give us, give us a call.

1725
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:13,667
1-800-236-3636.
>> Thanks, James. And when you

1726
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:16,542
call us this evening here at PBS
Wisconsin and become a member,

1727
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,750
we have those. Thank you gifts.
Let me run through these

1728
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,999
briefly. One more time for you.
If you call and become a member

1729
01:28:22,999 --> 01:28:26,542
at the $15 a month level, you
have your choice of one of three

1730
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:29,834
items. You can take a DVD or Blu
ray copy of the program that

1731
01:28:29,834 --> 01:28:32,417
we've just watched, so that
fabulous show on Wisconsin

1732
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:36,458
Lighthouses. Or you can take a
copy of the book that everything

1733
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:39,375
is based on. Wisconsin
Lighthouses by Ken and Barb

1734
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:42,458
Wardius. So that's a great in
depth look at at other

1735
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:46,750
lighthouses. More information.
Fabulous photographs are also

1736
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:50,917
included and your third choice
at that $15 a month level is

1737
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:54,667
this tote bag by with art by
Sophie Blackall. A beautiful

1738
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:59,917
tote, a nice heavy weight, but
on one side it has the Cana

1739
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,999
Island Lighthouse and that
Sophie did specifically for us

1740
01:29:01,999 --> 01:29:05,917
here at PBS Wisconsin. We have
it at night or during the day,

1741
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:09,458
so talk to one of our
volunteers. They can run through

1742
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:11,709
those levels and that
information for you once again

1743
01:29:11,709 --> 01:29:14,709
in the meantime, we're going to
go back one more time to talk to

1744
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:17,375
Ken and Barb Wardius again. The
authors of the book that end the

1745
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:21,583
book of Wisconsin Lighthouses
and the inspiration for the

1746
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:25,166
show. So enjoy hearing from Ken
and Barb.

1747
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:28,792
>> Hi, I'm Eric Greiling,
director of friends of PBS

1748
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:34,583
Wisconsin. We're back with Barb
and Ken now. You two are

1749
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:38,625
probably the experts on
Wisconsin Lighthouses for folks

1750
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:42,250
who are just inspired by the
program, they just watched, what

1751
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,999
kind of tips do you have for
visiting lighthouses around

1752
01:29:44,999 --> 01:29:46,999
Wisconsin?
>> Lighthouse festivals are a

1753
01:29:46,999 --> 01:29:50,999
great time to go the Apostle
Islands has one in the fall

1754
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:55,291
around labor Day and Door County
has one in the spring and in the

1755
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:58,542
fall, and there are lighthouses
that are often open that are not

1756
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:01,250
open to the public during the
rest of the year. It's a good

1757
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:04,999
chance to go and a lot of those
lighthouses are not open to the

1758
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:07,999
public, but some are.
>> What kind of guidance do you

1759
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:10,291
have of the 48 lights in the
state?

1760
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:13,667
>> Eric? Less than a third of
them are open to the public and

1761
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:17,583
only a portion of those are in
any kind of form of, you know,

1762
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:20,959
good restoration where you'd
want to go in and really look at

1763
01:30:20,959 --> 01:30:25,250
what life was like back in the
1800s. For example, there's a

1764
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:28,999
number of lighthouses that have
friends, organizations involved

1765
01:30:28,999 --> 01:30:32,999
with them. Those are very, very
helpful to check their resources

1766
01:30:32,999 --> 01:30:36,458
out as well.
>> Speaking of resources, in

1767
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:38,667
addition to your book, what
kinds of additional resources

1768
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:42,333
would you recommend?
>> Oh my goodness, we were so

1769
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,834
blessed by so many people and so
many organizations helping with

1770
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:50,208
research, public libraries,
historical societies. There's a

1771
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:52,875
number of lighthouse researchers
throughout the United States, a

1772
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:57,999
couple names come to mind Terry
Pepper. Com and Lighthouse

1773
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:04,166
Friends dot org are a wealth of
information of lighthouses

1774
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:07,041
throughout the Great Lakes, as
well as the entire country, and

1775
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:11,750
we should say you also have a
lecture on our university place

1776
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,542
series, which folks can find
online.

1777
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:17,834
>> We do. That's great. That's
great.

1778
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:20,917
coming into the studio. Thank
you for watching. I hope you've

1779
01:31:20,917 --> 01:31:23,709
enjoyed Wisconsin Lighthouses.
If you want to make a gift to

1780
01:31:23,709 --> 01:31:26,792
support this program, take
advantage of some of our thank

1781
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:29,000
you gifts. Like this book
Wisconsin Lighthouses. You can

1782
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,999
make that call right now at
1-800-236-3636.

1783
01:31:34,999 --> 01:31:39,458
>> And now I'm going to say but
wait, there's more. Again, you

1784
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:43,333
know, the program is over and
maybe you'll be getting a Blu

1785
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:47,792
ray or DVD of it with your with
your thank you gift. But we

1786
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:50,542
actually are going to have
coming up here a behind the

1787
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:55,792
scenes of how this program was
made. I mentioned this at an

1788
01:31:55,792 --> 01:31:58,250
earlier break. It took years to
make this between the research

1789
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:01,999
and the filming and the
interviewing, I mean, this is a

1790
01:32:01,999 --> 01:32:05,250
major undertaking, and you're
going to get to see kind of

1791
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:09,959
behind the scenes how that all
works. So stick for around that.

1792
01:32:09,959 --> 01:32:14,959
But you know, it's important to
remember that a program like

1793
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:20,417
this is a big risk for PBS
Wisconsin again, took years to

1794
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:26,999
make this. We need to know that
it matters to you. We need to

1795
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:29,999
you want us to keep doing, and
we're going to know that when

1796
01:32:29,999 --> 01:32:33,917
you give us a call, one
(800) 236-3636, you know, to

1797
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:37,999
make a show like this takes a
lot of people.

1798
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:41,542
who you see in the show, the
people who make the show and

1799
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:43,999
Kerman has been very modest
about this because Kerman, who

1800
01:32:43,999 --> 01:32:48,375
you've been hearing from, was a
key part of the crew that made

1801
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,667
this show. I'm just going to say
that because she won't she did

1802
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:53,999
all the sound work on it. Thank
you. Kerman, but it also takes

1803
01:32:53,999 --> 01:32:57,041
people who give the financial
support, which is why we have

1804
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:00,625
these pledge breaks. There are
some folks who are in a position

1805
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:03,333
in their lives where they can
make a really generous donation,

1806
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:06,500
and perhaps that's true for you
now. And if you are in a

1807
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,999
position where you could give
$1,000 a year as part of our

1808
01:33:09,999 --> 01:33:13,166
leadership circle, this is a
great time to do it. There's

1809
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:15,709
never been a better time to
express your support for PBS

1810
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:20,417
Wisconsin now, whatever you
give, whether it's $20 or $1000,

1811
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:24,542
that's what is correct for you
to do. And that's what the best

1812
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:26,875
thing to do is. But if you're in
a position where you're able to

1813
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:29,999
give it that higher level,
please think about it. It's

1814
01:33:29,999 --> 01:33:33,041
something really, I believe,
worth supporting. And I hope you

1815
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:40,999
do too. So call us at one
(800) 236-3636.

1816
01:33:40,999 --> 01:33:43,375
you can join us this evening,
whether it's, as James said,

1817
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:46,792
that $1,000 level or any other
level that you that you can

1818
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:50,166
manage to do, it is a wonderful
thing for us here at PBS

1819
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:53,375

items. So that's a fabulous way
to say thank you. We also have

1832
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:41,999
one more special group that I'd
like to tell you about. And this

1833
01:34:41,999 --> 01:34:45,041
is at $20 a month. We will send
you a copy of hello lighthouse.

1834
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:48,875
This is a Caldecott winning book
by Sophie Blackall. The art in

1835
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:51,834
this book is absolutely
fabulous. It is absolutely

1836
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:55,333
gorgeous to look at, but also it
tells a wonderful story of

1837
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:58,333
people trying to tend the
lighthouse and keep the

1838
01:34:58,333 --> 01:35:01,125
lighthouse going. Plus, we'll
send you this wonderful night,

1839
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:06,000
nighttime Nightlight that has
the called the lighthouse in the

1840
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,999
daytime and then it lights up
and you see the lighthouse at

1841
01:35:09,999 --> 01:35:13,333
night. And again, the art is
also by Sophie Blackall. So

1842
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:17,250
that's at $20 a month. So we
have many wonderful gifts that

1843
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:21,417
we can send your way. You can
talk to our one of our

1844
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:26,625
volunteers and get some more
information about them. And it

1845
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:29,999
(800) 236-3636.
that last package that Kermit

1846
01:35:29,999 --> 01:35:33,166
was just talking about with the
with the children's book and the

1847
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:36,375
nightlight, I mean, it sounds
like it's geared for kids, righ?

1848
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:39,333
But like, let's be honest, I
have a nightlight in my

1849
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:43,000
bathroom, right? So that when I
wake up in the middle of the

1850
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,500
night, I can see something and
like, yeah, I can go on Amazon

1851
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,959
and I can buy like one of those
just blank circular lights. But

1852
01:35:49,959 --> 01:35:53,542
but this is a piece of art. This
is a way to have art in my

1853
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:57,041
bathroom. As well as the
function of a nightlight. So I

1854
01:35:57,041 --> 01:36:01,333
think all of those gift levels
are really appropriate for

1855
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:03,583
And of course, that's the point,
is that we're talking about

1856
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:07,250
things that are meaningful
across generations. A program

1857
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:10,917
like this brings us together as
a state and a community. James

1858
01:36:10,917 --> 01:36:14,917
was talking about people who can
afford to give a larger gift. If

1859
01:36:14,917 --> 01:36:17,875
that's out of reach for you,
right now, maybe you can put us

1860
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:21,083
in your estate plan and become a
part of the Heritage Society.

1861
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:25,166
There's all sorts of ways to be
a part of the PBS Wisconsin

1862
01:36:25,166 --> 01:36:29,417
community. What matters is that
you call and start that process.

1863
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:34,709
1-800- 236-3636 >>We've talked
about about all the work that

1864
01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:37,208
goes into making a program like
this.

1865
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:41,041
I mean, it takes years of
research, production, editing,

1866
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:46,208
writing, re-editing, sometimes
it really is a labor of love an,

1867
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:49,750
you know, in your own life that
things that are good take time.

1868
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:52,999
Things that are good are not
easy. And that's something which

1869
01:36:52,999 --> 01:36:56,792
we know here. And we appreciate,
we appreciate in craftspeople.

1870
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:59,792
We appreciate it in our own crew
It's something that really makes

1871
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:03,999
a difference. We think and so we
want to take just a few minutes

1872
01:37:03,999 --> 01:37:07,208
now to show you a behind the
scenes look at some of the work

1873
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:09,917
that went into making this a
really extraordinary show that

1874
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:12,834
brings a show like Wisconsin
Lighthouses to life, made it

1875
01:37:12,834 --> 01:37:16,041
come to life because of you. So
thank you for that. Take a look.

1876
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:20,583
>> All right, man, all aboard!
[MUSIC]

1877
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:24,208
>> Woohoo! Today we're going to.
[MUSIC]

1878
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:27,999
There it is.
>> Setting up the gimbal.

1879
01:37:27,999 --> 01:37:30,000
[MUSIC]
And it allows me to move the

1880
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,208
camera around without getting
any big shaky movements.

1881
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:42,083
[MUSIC]
Yeah.

1882
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:49,208
here.
[MUSIC]

1883
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:53,208
>> Okay. Driving over the
causeway here.

1884
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:56,999
>> It's another day at the
office.

1885
01:37:56,999 --> 01:38:08,999
[MUSIC]
[MUSIC]

1886
01:38:08,999 --> 01:38:12,291
That's good.
>> You can go ahead and hold her

1887
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:14,083
there.
[MUSIC]

1888
01:38:14,083 --> 01:38:33,458
>> Look at that. We've hired.

1889
01:38:33,999 --> 01:38:40,999
[MUSIC]
Crew. Go.

1890
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:45,999
>> Yo, we just bushwhacked.
>> We have had to don mosquito

1891
01:38:45,999 --> 01:38:48,999
clothing.
>> I gotta say, I've never had

1892
01:38:48,999 --> 01:38:52,041
anything this ridiculous on my
body before, but, man, this is a

1893
01:38:52,041 --> 01:39:09,999
lifesaver.

1894
01:39:31,625 --> 01:39:34,250
It's that easy, kids.

1895
01:39:39,999 --> 01:39:42,500
>> Well, we hope you enjoyed
that behind the scenes look,

1896
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,667
giving you just a little taste
of some of the work that the

1897
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:48,792
fabulous field crew that went
out and brought back these

1898
01:39:48,792 --> 01:39:52,208
images and these sounds of these
lighthouses just to give a shout

1899
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:55,333
out, you saw the two primary
videographers, James Donovan and

1900
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:58,291
Mike Barron, and then also Emily
Julka, who did some additional

1901
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:01,625
photography on the show. You saw
Jeff Pfeiffer, he is the

1902
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:04,999
producer of the show. And of
course, there were many other

1903
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,999
people that were so involved in
the, the, the post-production

1904
01:40:07,999 --> 01:40:10,999
work grant Fenster and so many
others that were were involved.

1905
01:40:10,999 --> 01:40:14,166
So but this fabulous show is
here because of you and other

1906
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:18,458
people from around the state who
say PBS Wisconsin is something

1907
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:21,250
that I value. I love seeing
shows that are so Wisconsin

1908
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,375
specific and that's because of
your support. So if it's
