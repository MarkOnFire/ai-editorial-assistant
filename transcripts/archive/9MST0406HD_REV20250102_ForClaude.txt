1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,437
- John McGivern:
I am in one of the oldest cities

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,605
in Minnesota,
on a bluff

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,975
overlooking
the Mississippi River.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,376
- Announcer:
We thank the underwriters

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,677
of <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i>

6
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,881
because, without them,
we couldn't make this show.

7
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,916
- Announcer: The Wisconsin
Northwoods are calling.

8
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,986
One word, one place.
Minocqua.

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,688
- Man: My father taught me
that to make great bakery,

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,290
you have to do it the right way.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:28,262
O&H Danish Bakery,
where Kringle traditions begin.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,231
- Announcer: There's always
something shining bright

13
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,033
in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,938
- Announcer: Your community's
best selfie spot is Your-Type.

15
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,373
- Announcer: Visit Oconomowoc.

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,542
Lakes, festivals,
shopping, dining.

17
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,010
The heart of Lake Country.

18
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:48,482
- Announcer: Yes, Greendale
is beautiful on the outside,

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,552
but it's what's inside
that counts.

20
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,055
Who doesn't love opening a door
to their happy place?

21
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:59,259
Whether it's indulging
your sweet tooth...

22
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,495
winding down...

23
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,666
or exploring
your creative side...

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,236
come on in.

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,372
You just gotta see Greendale.

26
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,376
- Announcer: <i>John McGivern's</i>
<i>Main Streets</i> is grateful for

27
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,080

and from the Friends
of PBS Wisconsin.

32
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,964
Thanks, underwriters!

33
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,201
- ? 'Cause these are
our main streets ?

34
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,004
? Something about
a hometown speaks to me ?

35
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,174
? There's nowhere else
I'd rather be ?

36
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,910
? The heart and soul
of community's ?

37
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,645
? Right here ?

38
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,648
? On these main streets ?

39
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,184
? ?

40
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,020
- John: Saint Paul
is the capital of Minnesota,

41
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:03,090
and with a population
of just over 303,000,

42
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,927
it's the second-largest city
in the state of Minnesota,

43
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,063
right next to its twin,
Minneapolis.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,100
Saint Paul is about
12 miles east of Minneapolis

45
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,770
and about
20 miles west of Wisconsin.

46
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,273
The southern edge
of Saint Paul lies

47
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,408
where the Minnesota
and the Mississippi Rivers

48
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,277
come together.

49
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,946
Saint Paul has dozens
of historic neighborhoods

50
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,080
like this one.

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,383
This is called Cathedral Hill,

52
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,153
and it's named after
its historic landmark,

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,889
the Cathedral of Saint Paul.

54
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,692
Emmy, we are in Saint Paul,
one of the Twin Cities.

55
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,629
So, as our historian, which of
the Twin Cities is the oldest?

56
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,298
- Emmy Fink:
The oldest is Saint Paul.

57
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,767
- John: And when did Saint Paul
actually become a city?

58
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,935
- Emmy Fink: 1854.

59
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,570
But it had been put on the map

60
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,440
thanks to a gentleman named
Pierre "Pig's Eye" Parrant,

61
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,110
who was a fur trader, but then
turned into a bootlegger.

62
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,812
But people called him
"Pig's Eye."

63
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,415
- John: Well, I think
Saint Paul is much more
appropriate than Pig's Eye.

64
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,950
- Emmy: And a Catholic priest
agreed.

65
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,352
He came.
He named the city Saint Paul

66
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,221
after a chapel
that he had just built.

67
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,622
- John: Who lived here?

68
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,190
- Emmy: Well,
look at these places.

69
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,792
We're talking, like,
the wealthiest

70
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,560
early business owners.

71
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,796
They built these beautiful,
large, extravagant homes

72
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,064
and buildings.
- John: Yeah.

73
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,866
- Emmy: But what's nice
is they're still here.

74
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,467
- John: We should explore
all of this.

75
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,870
- Emmy: Yes. House hunt?
- John: Do you have a realtor?

76
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,072
- Emmy: I don't. Do you?
- John: Let's get house--

77
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,473
Come on,
let's go look at these.

78
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,308
Do you remember
that old TV show

79
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,310
<i>Lifestyles of</i>
<i>the Rich and Famous?</i>

80
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,679
If that had been going on
in the 19th century,

81
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,550
this would have been
the backdrop: Summit Avenue.

82
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,987
This is the longest avenue
of Victorian homes

83
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,055
in the United States.

84
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,958
They were all built
before the Great Depression,

85
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,627
then some were left vacant,

86
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,262
some were turned
into rooming houses.

87
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,932
And then, of course, restoration
of this historic neighborhood

88
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,800
began in the 1960s.

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,037
373 of the original 440 homes,

90
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,540
historical homes
on Summit Avenue,

91
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,542
are still standing.

92
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,843
? ?

93
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,545
What a beautiful home!

94
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,713
When was this built,
and why is it so big?

95
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,715
- Mariah Ring:
"Why is it so big?"

96
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,584
So it was built in 1888

97
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,354
and completed in 1891
by James and Mary Hill.

98
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,356
And part of the reason why
it's so big

99
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,158
is because
they had the money to do it.

100
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,760
- John: And he made
his money how?

101
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,261
- Mariah: The railroad.

102
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,130
He builds
a transcontinental railroad,

103
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,299
not the first
but a very successful one.

104
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,234
He was married to Mary Hill.
- John: Yeah.

105
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,403
And he had how many kids?
- Mariah: They had ten.

106
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,938
- John: Why didn't
the kids keep this house?

107
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,172
- Gibson Stanton:
That's a great question.

108
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,941
Realistically, they all had
their own lives,

109
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,642
and so, they
didn't really need this space.

110
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,045
- Mariah: And then,
it was donated
to the archdiocese after that.

111
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,247
- John: Oh, is that right?
The Catholic Church got it.

112
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,415
- Mariah: Correct.

113
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,117
- John: And now,
it's a state historical place.

114
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,953
- Gibson: We are
in the art gallery

115
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,022
of the James J. Hill House,
complete with a custom organ.

116
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,925
- John: It would scream that
this is a house with some money.

117
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,560
- Gibson: With a little bit
of money.

118
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,162
- John: Yeah.

119
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,898
- Mariah: We have different
events and rentals that happen.

120
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,401
We have tours and school tours
of all different kinds.

121
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,237
- John: So this is
quite the dining room.

122
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
- Mariah: It is, isn't it?
- John: [chuckling] Right.

123
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,707
The ceiling is what?

124
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,076
- Mariah:
It's 24-karat gold leaf.

125
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,110
- Gibson:
Welcome to the basement.

126
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,612
- John: And what was down here?

127
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,413
- Gibson: This is where the
staff were primarily working,

128
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,215
so you have
the servants' dining room.

129
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,783
We have a wine cellar.

130
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,218
- John: The kitchen.
- Gibson: The kitchen.

131
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,820
- John: This is very
<i>Downton Abbey,</i> you know.

132
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,522
- Gibson: It is.
It's Saint Paul's <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

133
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,323
- John: Yeah.
[Gibson laughs]

134
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,125
- Mariah: This was the ballroom.
- John: Yeah.

135
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,994
It's a gorgeous space.
- Mariah: Mm-hmm.

136
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,396
- Gibson: And if somebody were
to come in and break in,

137
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,797
the current
would be broken here,

138
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,200
and it would wake you up
in the middle of the night.

139
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,203
[mechanical bell blares]
- John: Somebody's in 18!

140
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,538
So great.

141
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,040
And how all of the woodwork
all over this house

142
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,441
just looks terrific.

143
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,709
- Gibson: It's been
really well-preserved.

144
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,311
- John: They sure lived
differently, didn't they?

145
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,080
- Gibson: They definitely did!
[John laughs]

146
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,482
? ?

147
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,851
This is the Louis Hill house,
and this is Nancy Nicholson.

148
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,019
How are you?

149
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,487
Nancy Nicholson:
I'm good, thank you.

150
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,822
- John: Because this is not the
Louis Hill house anymore, is it?

151
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,391
- Nancy: No, it's Dick
and Nancy's house. [laughs]

152
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,226
- John: That's what it is!

153
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,862
And half of this
is the original house, right?

154
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,063
- Nancy: Correct.

155
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,298
- John: And do you
ever fill this table?

156
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,733
- Nancy: Oh, honey, yes.
All the leaves are in.

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,902
It seats 22.
- John: 22.

158
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,171
- Nancy: We don't have
any secret passageways.

159
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,974
- John: How many years later
did they add on to the house?

160
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,877
- Nancy: But ten years later...

161
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,546
We have the good old safe,
and...

162
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,348
Louis Hill
has just become president

163
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:25,185
of the Great Northern Railroad,
which James J. Hill started.

164
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,922
So, this is
what's precious to Nancy.

165
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,891
This is my solarium,

166
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,662
and it's a little bit of Florida
here in Saint Paul.

167
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,097
- John: It was built
the same time the house was?

168
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,966
- Nancy: Yes, 1902.

169
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:43,637
The stained-glass windows
were finished in 1904.

170
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:48,175
And here is a copy of
the receipt, and it was $590.

171
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,043
So, uh, good taste...

172
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,279
- John: I'll give you
a thousand bucks for it.

173
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,481
- Nancy: No, no, no.
- John: I swear to God.

174
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,084
- Nancy: And then,
upstairs is a grand ballroom.

175
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,920
And he also added
a pipe organ.

176
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,989
- John: Because he wanted
to entertain.

177
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,323
- Nancy: He wanted to entertain.

178
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,325
- John: And is that
still here, that pipe organ?

179
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,728
- Nancy: It is, and it plays.
- John: And it plays.

180
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,129
- Nancy: Yes, yes.
- John: Yeah.

181
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,631
[Nancy plays organ smoothly]

182
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,667
You will notice we respected
the history of the home,

183
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,337
so we brought it back to
what it was like

184
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,040
for Louis and Maud Hill.
- John: Right, wow.

185
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,209
And how great that it's
all stayed, it's all lasted...

186
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,311
- Nancy: Yes, yes.
- John: That nobody was like,

187
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,979
"Oh, let's get rid of that."

188
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,649
- Nancy: Well, I would say,
"Let's ring the bell
for preservation."

189
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,883
- John: Yeah, preservation.

190
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,152
You should be on the cover.
[Nancy laughs]

191
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,887
- John: Thank you.

192
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,192
You've been a rector
at this cathedral for how long?

193
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,593
- Father Joseph Johnson:
About two weeks.

194
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,994
- Two weeks? How about that?
[both laugh]

195
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,596
- Father Joseph:
So, I'm a real expert.

196
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,798
- John: I've heard the story
that you were here before.

197
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,200
- Father Joseph:
I was here before.

198
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,601
- John: How long ago was that?

199
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,770
- Father Joseph:
That was 12 years ago.
- John: Oh, good.

200
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,773
- Father Joseph:
I'm my own predecessor
and my own successor, right?
- John: Right!

201
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,175
How long have you been a priest?
- Father Joseph: 26 years.

202
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,844
- John: And did you seminary
in Saint Paul?

203
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,445
- Father Joseph: No, in Rome.
- John: In Rome.

204
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,614
- Father Joseph: So, I think
the reason they gave me

205
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,449
a big, old stone church is
they knew I'd spent

206
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,451
a decade of my life living
around big, old stone churches.

207
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,053
- John:
You knew what it felt like?

208
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,921
- Father Joseph: Yes.

209
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,423
It is a functioning parish
community,

210
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,625
as well as the mother
of the church of the diocese,

211
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:15,028
as well as a national shrine,
as well as a civic monument,

212
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,865
deeply cherished, part of
the history of this community.

213
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,467
- John: When was the first brick
laid on this building?

214
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,603
- Father Joseph: 1906,
they started digging the hole.

215
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,904
- John: When were
the doors opened?

216
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,073
- Father Joseph:
Well, so 1915, for Palm Sunday,

217
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,808
was the first Mass.
- John: Yeah.

218
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,810
- Father Joseph: And Saint Paul
was largely the immigrants

219
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,680
who were German, and a lot of
Irish and French and Italian

220
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,148
and Eastern European.

221
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,150
So, part of our cathedral
is actually dedicated to

222
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,485
those immigrant groups
that came.

223
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,221
- John: If we're comparing
domes, this and the Capitol,

224
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,656
which one's bigger?

225
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,491
- Father Joseph:
There's no comparison.
- John: There isn't.

226
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,759
- Father Joseph:
This is much bigger.

227
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,995
So it's the sixth-largest dome
in America.

228
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,197
- John: It's so well done,
isn't it?
- Father Joseph: It is.

229
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,065
- John: Let's talk about
these four pillars.

230
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,868
- So, the pillars of the church
support the weight of the dome.

231
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,270
And then, in them, we put

232
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,505
the statues
of the four gospel writers,

233
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,941
the evangelists
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

234
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,711
Because those gospels tell us
the life and teaching of Jesus,

235
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,513
those are
the pillars of our faith.

236
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,515
And then this, of course,
is the chair.

237
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,684
The <i>cathedra.</i>
- John: Cathedra.

238
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,920
- Father Joseph: ...which gives
its status as cathedral

239
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,154
rather than
just a parish church.

240
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,390
- John: Yeah,
can we talk about cost?

241
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,359
I know that my father would say,
"What did you ask him?!"

242
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:23,096
- Father Joseph: It's hard to
get a total for how much it cost

243
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,232
because it was built in phases.

244
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,868
But sometimes people say to me,
you know,

245
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,437
"Why, you know,
spend all of this money on it?"

246
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:34,708
It was because they wanted to,
to do something beautiful,
you know?

247
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,109
But this became a place

248
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,412
where everyone could come
and be touched by that beauty.

249
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,380
And all beauty, whether
it's the beauty of nature

250
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,016
or the beauty of art,
reminds us of the beauty of God.

251
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,051
- John: Yeah, nice.

252
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,786
? ?

253
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,256
Saint Paul is the birthplace of
the author F. Scott Fitzgerald.

254
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,358
We know his work,
<i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

255
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,329
He was born on
the second floor of this house.

256
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,897
His family moved to Buffalo,

257
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,866
but they couldn't stay away
from Saint Paul.

258
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,400
They moved back,
and they moved

259
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,103
into this house
on Summit Avenue.

260
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,505
After a stint in the Army

261
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,307
and after suffering
a broken-hearted relationship,

262
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,811
Fitzgerald moved back in with
his family here in Saint Paul.

263
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,312
And because
of that heartbreak,

264
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,316
he wrote his first novel,
<i>This Side of Paradise.</i>

265
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,918
If you don't know that,
pick it up.

266
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,520
I think it's better
than <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

267
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,687
I really do.

268
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,189
Now, it's early work,
but after that...

269
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,457
? ?

270
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,759
We are sitting at the bar
at W.A. Frost.

271
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,629
How are you, sir?
- William Kent Krueger:
Very good, John, very good.

272
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,030
- John: Let's talk about
your work.

273
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,065
Let's talk about
how people know you.

274
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,067
- William Kent Krueger:
Well, for most of my career,

275
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,302
which has spanned now

276
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,404
better than a quarter of
a century of publication,

277
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,173
I've been best known
as the author of

278
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,674
the-- I love saying this--

279
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,844
<i>New York Times</i> bestselling
Cork O'Connor Mystery Series.

280
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,979
- John: Congratulations!
Isn't that great to say?

281
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,781
- William: I love saying it,
love saying it.

282
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,149
- John: Good for you.

283
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,352
You know, 21 is a--
that's quite a series.

284
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,423
- William: If you'd asked me
a quarter of a century ago...

285
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,724
[laughs]

286
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,726
"Are there going to be
21 books in your series?"

287
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,728
I'd have said you were nuts.
- John: "You're nuts."

288
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:02,996
- William: Yeah.
- John: Yeah.

289
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,199
- William: If you've been
writing as long as I have,

290
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,600
you hope
that you get a following.

291
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,902
And I have a really,
really nice following now.

292
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,370
- John: And most of the action
takes place

293
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,673
in the State of Minnesota, yes?
- William: Absolutely.

294
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,908
They are
Minnesota-centric stories.

295
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,411
- John: Is there a schedule that
you keep every day, writing?

296
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:21,048
- William: Seven days a week,
I'm up before 6:00.

297
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,383
I write for 2 to 3 hours,

298
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,220
and that's when I do
all my creative work.

299
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,222
I got that from Hemingway,

300
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:33,560
who loved nothing better than
rising at first light every day

301
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,395
and spending
the first two hours writing.

302
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,232
He thought it was the most
creative time of the day.

303
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,700
It has worked.
- John: Yeah.

304
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,969
Were you raised in this city,
in this area?

305
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,770
- William: No,
I'm not native to Saint Paul.

306
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,173
- John: You weren't, but this
is home now, 40 years later?

307
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,774
- William: It's been home
for 40 years.

308
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,710
And I think of every book
that I write

309
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,079
is kind of a valentine
to this adopted home of mine.

310
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,347
I want readers

311
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,983
to fall in love with Minnesota
the way I love it.

312
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,185
- Thanks for talking to me.
- William: Thanks, John.

313
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,821
- John: A pleasure, thanks.

314
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,224
There is a cartoonist
who created cartoon characters

315
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,927
that everybody knows and loves.

316
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:11,265
Who is this beloved cartoonist
who was raised in Saint Paul

317
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,001
and inspired by this city?

318
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,869
[quizzical music]

319
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,406
- Emmy: Look who I found--
Linus and Sally.

320
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,175
And their creator,
Charles Schulz,

321
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,577
well, he grew up right here
in Saint Paul.

322
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,080
Of course,
Snoopy is everybody's favorite.

323
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,248
Good boy.

324
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,552
The first comic
was published back in 1950.

325
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,954
Oh, Lucy, it'll never happen.

326
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,123
Fast-forward 75 years later,

327
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,759
and all of these characters
are still so loved.

328
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,462
Look at this
amazing spaghetti hair!

329
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,065
- John: So, this is
your coffee shop?
- June Berkowitz: It is.

330
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,266
- John: It's called
Nina's Coffee.

331
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,068
Nina is part of the history
of this neighborhood.

332
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,670
And what did Nina do
in this neighborhood?

333
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,471
- Nina was a madam.
- John: A madam.

334
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:54,274
- Back in the John Dillinger
days, she owned a brothel.

335
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,343
This was the Angus Hotel.

336
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,580
And so, people think
that it was Nina's brothel,

337
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,681
but that's not true.

338
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,349
That was Downtown Saint Paul.

339
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,918
So, I decided to keep the name.
- And how long ago was that?

340
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,720
- June Berkowitz:
Twenty years ago.
It'll be 20 in February.

341
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,590
- John: So you've owned
this coffee shop for 20 years.
- June: Twenty years.

342
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,191
- John: Can we talk about
this neighborhood?

343
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,593
- June: It's an incredibly
diverse neighborhood,

344
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,161
which makes
it very appealing to me.

345
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:16,864
And that's one of the reasons
I wanted to be here
on this corner.

346
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,031
It's a neighborhood café.

347
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,233
- John: And this building...

348
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,634
What's the history
of this building?

349
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,636
- June: If you look
from the outside, you'll notice

350
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,305
it's one big brownstone
with 40 condos above.

351
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,174
- John: It's great.
- June: Yeah, so pretty.

352
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,376
- John: Is there a reason
for her to be here?

353
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,978
- June: No.
- John: Spot?

354
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,747
- June: She came with the spot.
- John: Now she's iconic here.

355
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,283
- June: Absolutely.
This is called the crow's nest.

356
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,418
People come here
at 6:30 in the morning

357
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,187
so that they can get
that spot.

358
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,990
From the perch,
you can hear and see everything.

359
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,158
- Doing a "Madam Nina."
- John: Which is what?

360
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,361
- It's a latte
with honey and cinnamon.

361
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,197
- John: Tap it down.
It seems second nature to you.

362
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,466
- I'll see if I can make it
nice and pretty.

363
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,768
- John: Good.
What's the trick to that?

364
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,304
- Years of practice.
- John: Is it? [laughs]

365
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,805
Look at that!

366
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,607
- June: The people behind
the counter,

367
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,209
they build relationships
with people.

368
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:06,079
And remember, it's about
community first, coffee second.

369
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,681
- John: So, are you
a good barista?

370
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:11,018
- June: No. I'm horrible.
- John: You-- [guffaws]

371
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,187
June, to Nina's.
- June: Cheers.

372
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,189
- John: This is delicious.
- June: Is it good?

373
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,924
[laughter]

374
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,260
[playful acoustic jazz]

375
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,262
- John: When did you open
this up-- this location?

376
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,298
- Marc Heu:
It was May 20th of 2023.

377
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,899
- John: 2023.
- Marc: Yes.

378
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,702
- Gaosong Heu: One day,
I was driving down the street
here on Dale,

379
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,938
and then,
I saw that this spot was open,

380
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,574
and I was like, "That would be
the perfect location for us."

381
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,776
It just felt...
<i>right.</i>

382
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,512
Sometimes, when it's right,
it just is.

383
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,647
- John: And so,
a patisserie is a--

384
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,249
is it what we call bakeries?

385
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,051
- Marc: We make the croissant--
it's a dough--

386
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,686
but we also make pastries.

387
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,188
I mainly focused on dessert,
on cakes.

388
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,756
- John: Talk about
your journey here

389
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,158
as far as pastries go,

390
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,961
- Marc: When I did come to the
U.S., I was a medical student.

391
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,362
- John:
You were a medical student.

392
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,564
- Marc: Yes. And found out
that-- oh, you know what?--

393
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:58,966
it's actually not
my first passion.

394
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,768
My first passion
has always been food
and, especially, pastry.

395
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,071
What if I can turn that hobby,
that passion,

396
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,474
into making a living
and sharing it with people?

397
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,711
- John: We did good. [chuckling]
- Marc: Awesome.

398
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,413
- Gaosong: I encouraged Marc to
follow his passions and dreams.

399
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,449
Also, selfishly, I just like
to eat good food,

400
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,251
so I wanted to see everything
that he made.

401
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,452
- John: A good croissant?
C'mon.

402
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,254
- Gaosong: Yeah,
but I could have never imagined

403
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,256
this would've been our life,
but I'm really happy.

404
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,459
And just every day, I think--
I'm just shocked and amazed

405
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:27,494
that this is, like,
the life that we've been able

406
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,996
to create together.
- John: Congratulations.

407
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,798
- Marc: I always joke around
that I get to do the fun part,

408
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,800
which is just 1% of
the business, making the goods,

409
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,204
and my wife, Gaosong, just
takes care of everything else.

410
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,940
- Gaosong: I just can't wait
to share more of Marc's talents

411
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,475
with, like, everybody
in our community.

412
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,809
- Marc: It's always joyful

413
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,444
to be sharing your passion
with other people.

414
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,946
I mean, it's food.

415
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,248
Anybody needs to eat,
and anybody deserves,
like, a good treat.

416
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,918
So, every time we make
something,

417
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,319
we have to be mindful of that,

418
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,121
and we have to make sure
that it's affordable

419
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,722
to most of people.

420
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,357
- Gaosong: I'm just really happy
that people

421
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:01,094
want to use our desserts
as a point of celebration.

422
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,230
- Marc: I love Saint Paul,
I love Minneapolis,

423
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,731
I love Minnesota.

424
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,400
- John: That's delicious.
My Lord.

425
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,436
- Marc: I love America.
- John: OK, well, you should.

426
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:10,871
- Marc: Yeah!
[all laughing]

427
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,606
? ?

428
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,809
- John: We're at a restaurant
called Moscow on the Hill.

429
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,144
I love this story.

430
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,745
How did this place begin?

431
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,948
- Marina Liberman: It began
as a French restaurant

432
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,150
called Quail on a Hill,

433
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,720
and we bought it in 1994.
- John: OK.

434
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,056
Where were you before 1994?

435
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,592
- Marina:
We came in 1992 from Moscow.

436
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,327
So, we're family from Moscow,
yeah.

437
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,862
We didn't have
any cooking education.

438
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,663
- John: Restaurant was not
your background in Moscow.

439
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,831
- Marina: No, no.

440
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,433
- John: What did you do
in Moscow?

441
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,435
- Marina: I'm a neurologist.
- John: You're a neurologist?

442
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,237
- Marina: Yes.
- John: Is the restaurant work

443
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,038
a little different than...
- Marina: Just a little.

444
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,440
- John: ...than brain science,
isn't it?

445
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,009
- Marina: Just a little.
But you have to do the effort

446
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,813
to comfort your customer, which
is a really hard brain job.

447
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,082
- John: I bet it is, yeah.
- Marina: [laughs] Yeah.

448
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,684
- John: Did you have recipes in
your pocket that you were, like,

449
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,653
"This is what I want to serve
this community"?

450
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,788
- Eugene Liberman:
Traditional Russian cuisine

451
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,224
that would be good
for people in the Midwest.

452
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,526
- John: Right.
- Eugene: Right.

453
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,060
And Russian food is
similar to German cuisine.

454
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,730
- John: Polish?
- Eugene: Polish cuisine--

455
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,366
meat, potatoes, cheese, cabbage.

456
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,268
And we incorporate
all those things in.

457
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,104
- John: Is there a big Russian
community in the Twin Cities?

458
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,473
- Eugene: I'd say
about 60,000 to 70,000.

459
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,142
But our customers are good
old-fashioned Midwestern people.

460
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,811
- John: This is downtown
Cathedral Hill neighborhood.
- Eugene: Downtown neighborhood.

461
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,613
- John: What was it like
when you came?

462
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,349
- Marina: It's changed
dramatically through the years.

463
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,151
- John: And for the better?
- Marina: Absolutely.

464
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,153
So now it's a destination.

465
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,922
- John: Russia is known
for their vodka.

466
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,724
- Eugene: Nobody's going to have
more vodka than us,
maybe in the Midwest.

467
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,393
This is our horseradish vodka.
- John: Horseradish.

468
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,095
And this is really your recipe?
- Eugene: This is
my father's recipe.

469
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,331
- John: Your father's recipe.
- Eugene: My father's recipe,
yep, yep.

470
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,666
- John: So, people love
your patio?

471
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,201
- Eugene:
It's not on the street,

472
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,603
so not everybody sees it, but
that's also one of its charms.

473
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,105
- Marina: It's a salad known
everywhere in Europe.

474
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,907
It's called salad Olivier,

475
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,844
and usually is a salad served
on December 31st,

476
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,345
the biggest holiday
during the year.

477
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,247
- John: Do you have it
every New Year's Eve?

478
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:01,648
- Marina: Absolutely.
- John: You do?

479
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:02,916
- Marina: Everybody has it.

480
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:06,086
- John: Along with what?
- Marina: Vodka. [laughter]

481
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,155
You can see green peas.
- John: Green peas.

482
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:09,723
- Marina: Yeah.
You can see carrots.

483
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,124
You can see pickles.
- John: Sure.

484
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,392
- Marina: You can see ham.

485
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,195
In our case, it's a ham.
- John: Yeah.

486
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,597
You can join me if you like.

487
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,398
- Marina: Can I? Thank you.
- John: Yes, please. [chortles]

488
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,666
Very good, it's lovely.
Thank you so much.

489
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,168
- Marina:
You're more than welcome.

490
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,103
- Thank you for sharing it.
- Marina: Thank you so much,
sure.

491
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,638
- John: Congratulations
on 30 years in this business!

492
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:25,939
The American Dream.

493
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,242
You know, it says it all,
doesn't it?
- Marina: Yes.

494
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,844
- Emmy: One of the things I
love most about the Midwest is

495
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,212
it seems like every town

496
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,248
has their own unique
summer festival.

497
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,250
Well, here in this Saint Paul
neighborhood,

498
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,519
that festival is Rondo Days,

499
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,522
and it happens every year,
the third Saturday in July.

500
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,891
The Rondo neighborhood
forever changed

501
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,727
back in the '60s,
when the interstate was put in

502
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,629
and split the community in two,

503
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,765
so the geography of
the neighborhood has changed,

504
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,968
but the heart is still
right here.

505
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,605
- John: This is your shop.
Whose idea was this?

506
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,541
- Rdella White: It was actually
my husband's idea.

507
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,977
One day, he said, "Hmm...
How about we
open up a ice cream shop?"

508
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,180
And I was like,
"Oh, that's a good idea."

509
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,715
Whatever he wants
is what I want, so...

510
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,717
- John: Is that true?
- Brian White: Pretty much.

511
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,753
- John: OK, good.
That's good to know.

512
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,688
So it's not just ice cream,
right?

513
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,590
- Rdella: We're called
2 Scoops Ice Cream Eatery,

514
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,392
so we have a hot food menu.

515
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,060
We take pride in our food also.

516
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,929
- John: And who doesn't like
ice cream, right?

517
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,597
- Brian: Everybody likes
ice cream,

518
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,933
so little kids all the way
up to the grandparents

519
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,301
and everybody in between.

520
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,503
- Is there an ice cream flavor
that the kids really love?

521
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,104
- Brian: Oh, my goodness.
- Rdella: Yes.

522
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,106
- John: What is it?
- Brian and Rdella: Superman!

523
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,975
- John: Superman.
[all laugh]

524
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,210
Do you know this neighborhood?

525
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,811
- Brian: I grew up
in this neighborhood.

526
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,013
- This is your neighborhood?
- Brian: This is
my neighborhood.

527
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,416
This is where we grew up, and
this was our stomping ground,

528
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,817
so now this is
our ice cream shop.

529
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,819
- John: You're at
a great corner, too, aren't you?

530
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:46,987
- Brian: We are.

531
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,589
- John: Like, you can't miss
the place.

532
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,790
- Brian: Yeah, great location,
yeah.

533
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,925
- John: Talk about
the 2 Scoops for Kids.

534
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,327
- Rdella: So,
when parents come in,

535
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,295
sometimes when they don't
have enough money

536
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,730
to get all their children
ice cream,

537
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,131
we tell them,
"Don't worry about it."

538
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,068
We have a foundation here
that's called 2 Scoops for Kids.

539
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,703
No kid will go without
an ice cream cone.

540
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,104
We make sure they don't go.

541
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,907
No kid will walk out of
2 Scoops Ice Cream Eatery crying

542
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,742
because they don't
have ice cream.
No way.

543
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,143
- John: What's this?

544
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,412
- Leo Jackson: So, this is
our Cream of the Crop.

545
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,115
Every single
one of these athletes

546
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:18,185
has played a role
in our lives.

547
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,254
These are our friends,
family members,

548
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,189
people that I may have coached
or trained.

549
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,391
Maybe a little bit more.
- John: Cream of the Crop.

550
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,959
- Leo: Cream of the Crop.

551
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:28,762
Which one would you like today?
- I want
the homemade waffle cone.

552
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,364
- Leo: Homemade waffle cone
it is.

553
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,366
And then we've got
our 18 flavors to choose from.

554
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,902
And then we've even got
some vegan options

555
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,904
and some non-dairy options
for people.

556
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,840
- John: Nah,
not really interested.
[laughter]

557
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,508
Munchie Madness.
- Leo: You're
gonna try Munchie Madness?

558
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,676
- John: Yeah.

559
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,044
- Leo: All right,
you're gonna love it.

560
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,946
- Now, that's a good-looking
cone right there, isn't it?

561
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,347
- Leo: That is a waffle cone.

562
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,550
- John: I've been looking
forward to this for two days.

563
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,151
- Leo: Hey, absolutely.
Welcome to 2 Scoops.

564
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,953
I hope you're not on a diet.
[chuckles]

565
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,756
- John: That's none of your
business, man.

566
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,525
It's a corner ice cream shop.
Come on!

567
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,260
[laughter]

568
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:04,198
Saint Paul is home to
a minor league baseball team

569
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,533
called the St. Paul Saints.

570
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,269
It's an out-of-the-box name,
isn't it?
Yeah.

571
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,471
There's a comedic actor
who was part owner of that team

572
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:12,906
for many years.

573
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,741
Who was that comedic actor?

574
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,610
[quizzical music]

575
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:20,047
- Emmy: Here's a good hint
for you: <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

576
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,983
Actor Bill Murray
founded and was part-owner

577
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,654
of the St. Paul Saints for
20 years until it sold in 2023.

578
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,822
Now, this is what's cool.

579
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,023
It's not like he's from here.

580
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,191
He didn't grow up here.

581
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:32,359
He grew up in Illinois,

582
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:36,163
but he thinks Saint Paul
is pretty cool.

583
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,965
- John: We're at the Saint Paul
Curling Club

584
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,967
with the general manager,
Scott Clasen.
How are you, sir?

585
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,568
- Scott Clasen:
Pleasure to meet you, John.

586
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,769
- John: Good to see you.

587
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,371
Let's talk about
the history of this club.

588
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:48,375
When did the doors
of this club open?
- Scott: 1912.

589
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,911
We only had
six sheets of ice back then.

590
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,713
And then we added
two more sheets.

591
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,515
There are a few clubs
that have eight sheets,

592
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,384
but eight is the most
in the United States.

593
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,853
- John: So the sport of curling
consists of what?

594
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,389
- Scott: Curling is
basically sliding

595
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:05,926
a 40-pound piece of granite
100-plus feet down the ice

596
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,595
to a target, and each player
throws two rocks.

597
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,998
The closest rocks
to the center score.

598
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:12,966
- John: Who's the guy
with the broom?

599
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,601
- Scott: Typically,
there's two guys sweeping...

600
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,769
- John: Sweeping.

601
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,171
- Scott: ...when one guy
is throwing,

602
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,373
