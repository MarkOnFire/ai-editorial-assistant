1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:05,639
- I'm at the Pritzker Military
Museum and Library near Kenosha,

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,509
learning about their efforts
to be recognized as a hub

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:12,045
for military history
in the Midwest.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,382
[rousing marching band music]

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,153
I met with Rachel Marcella,
Manager of Programs and Events,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,191
to discover what visitors can
expect when they arrive here.

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,193
- Rachel Marcella: So as soon
as they come in,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,529
you are right
in our exhibit space.

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,999
So they kinda just get
the whole experience.

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,902
We have over 40,000 artifacts
in our own collection

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,670
that we'll put on display.

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,006
We're not just a museum,
we're also the library.

13
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,209
So the library has 60,000 books.

14
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,378
We usually have
a couple exhibits

15
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,380
that are rotating through.

16
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,881
Right now, we have an exhibit

17
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:51,451
highlighting women of color
who have served.

18
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,086
- Angela: I love that
because I think

19
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,655
we all maybe have an idea
in mind

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,456
when we think of who represents
the armed services,

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,026
the armed forces that you all
are like, "Yes,

22
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,429
and these other individuals
also represent."

23
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,431
And so I appreciate the
intentionality that you all take

24
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,434
with uplifting those stories
that aren't often heard.

25
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,338
- We, as a country,
have gone through so much

26
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,373
and we will continue
to go through so much.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,975
And it's so easy
to think that, like,

28
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,844
I am just living my piece in it,

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,314
but all of us as a community
are interwoven,

30
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,450
and it really helps strengthen
the ties, I think,

31
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,752
between the community.

32
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,421
[rousing marching band music]

33
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,790
- Angela: To explore that
military history,

34
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:34,261
I met up with Dustin DePue,
Director of Museum Collections,

35
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,664
who showed me a few items
found in archives here,

36
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,900
starting with trench art.

37
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,869
- Dustin DePue: Trench art
kind of became popularized

38
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,070
during World War I,

39
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,740
as there was millions
of artillery shells

40
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,675
littering the battlefields,

41
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,745
and so soldiers had a lot
of time on their hands.

42
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,082
They would often fashion it
into little art pieces,

43
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,918
use those to try to sell
or trade.

44
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,286
This is a piece

45
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,155
that's been sort of turned
into, like, a vase of some kind.

46
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,323
It is from a

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,360
French 75-millimeter
artillery shell casing.

48
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,629
It says "Verdun 1918."

49
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,064
Now, Verdun is a city
in northeastern France,

50
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,868
and it was the site of the
longest battle in World War I.

51
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,837
So a lot of times,
a piece like this

52
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:20,107
would've been made after the war
to commemorate that battle.

53
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,341
- Well, and that's interesting,

54
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,943
because you don't often think
about the materials

55
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,912
that are literally left behind
after battles

56
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,114
and what happens to them, other
than they just become waste.

57
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,715
- That's right.
- So the fact that

58
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,051
they're being repurposed.
- Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,953
I have another item
from World War I.

60
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,322
We've got a little bit
of a theme going today.

61
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:39,259
What we have here is
what is called a Brodie helmet.

62
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,362
It's sometimes called
a Doughboy helmet as well.

63
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,731
This helmet was worn
by Samuel Rigoulot,

64
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,500
who was in the
3rd Infantry division

65
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,304
and was present in what's called
the Second Battle of the Marne.

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,840
It was an incredibly important
and decisive battle

67
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,007
in World War I.

68
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,276
He was the victim
of a chemical warfare attack,

69
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,879
and was forced
off the front lines

70
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,581
and had to convalesce
with a French family

71
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,583
until he sort of healed up.

72
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,784
He did survive.

73
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,119
- And I'm assuming his family
donated this.

74
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,354
- That's correct, yes.

75
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,325
Yeah, so this is a real piece
of history here.

76
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,427
The last thing I have
is a lot more simple.

77
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,464
It is a mess kit,
so it's an American mess kit.

78
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,300
So our Doughboys,
as we call them,

79
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,969
when they were going overseas,
you know,

80
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,370
they would have this kit
with them,

81
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,974
and this is an instance of, you
can see some etching in there.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,942
- So someone personalized
their mess kit.

83
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,110
- Dustin: Exactly.

84
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,778
You can see the Eiffel Tower
on there.

85
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,081
You can see a bald eagle.

86
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,184
- Angela: From equipment used
on the battlefield

87
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,920
to art found in the trenches,

88
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,990
Pritzker Military Museum
has a treasure trove

89
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,059
of military history to explore.
