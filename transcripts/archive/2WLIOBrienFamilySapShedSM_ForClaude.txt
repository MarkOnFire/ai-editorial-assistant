nothing like being in the woods

00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,177
this time of year.

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:14,381
Spring is here
before it's anywhere else.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,885
Something about it
just is grounding.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,254
The sun hits you just right.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,456
And it's warm out here.

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,227
You're in the 10 acres
that we do maple syruping in.

00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:31,965
In order for us to tap trees,
a lot of the snow melts.

- Bridget Wenman: It's just a
absolutely beautiful place to be

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,340
in this time of year,
in the spring.

13

- Dave O'Brien: Well, we're here
at the O'Brien Maple Grove.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,045
It's where we grew up.

15
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,047
Our grandparents settled
out here.

16
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:50,083
And most of the families
in this area of the county

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,953
are all settled from Ireland.

- Jennifer: The parade
in New London is pretty amazing.

20
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,697
- Bridget: Every year
at Saint Patrick's weekend,

21
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:07,968
they change New London
to the city of New Dublin.

22
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,504
They change all the signs.

23
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,473
My parents were pretty involved
in that celebration.

24

- Reporter: I'm here with
Bob O'Brien, the commentator

25
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,779
and color host
for today's parade.

26
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,515
- Bridget: My dad emceed
that parade for years.

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,218
- Bob O'Brien: And here comes
a bunch of Irish farmers.

28
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,588
Those Irish farmers are very,
very good farmers,

29
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,056
you know that?

30
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,325
They spread an awful lot
of fertilizer,

31
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,726
and that's what makes them
so good.

[co-emcee laughing]

33
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,734
- Dave: My dad tapped
about 125 trees.

34
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,504
We would can 100 quarts a year.

35
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,939
And my dad just did it
as a hobby.

36
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,041
Now, for us kids,
it was a chore.

37
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,712
- I was out here from five, six,
seven years old,

38
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,380
as were my brothers and sisters.

39
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,250
I didn't like it.

four years old,

41
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,255
sitting on the tank,
and just there

42
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,023
while everyone else was doing
the hard work,

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,158
pouring the buckets
into the tractor.

[syrup splashing]

45
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,031
- Bridget: We have three
generations of people

46
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,433
that come out
and enjoy the property,

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,103
spend some time
collecting syrup.

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,206
- Dave: So my dad died in 1988,
and at that point,

49
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,442
my oldest brothers were getting
closer to retirement.

50
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,844
And they really took it
from there,

51
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,946
and it's expanded substantially.

52
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,948
They said, "We have more of us
that can help.

53
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,416
Let's tap 750 taps."

54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,152
And it really turned it
to start where we're at today,

55
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,455
which is we built this
beautiful, brand-new sap shed,

56
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,957
thanks to my brother Gene.

57
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,993
And it went from being a place
that we gathered in the spring

58
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,629
to 12 months out of the year.

59
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,501
As more of the family members
get involved,

60
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,004
they invest their time,
their kids get involved,

61
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,507
and it really brings
the family together.

62
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,509
- It was never
about making money.

63
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,378
It was about making maple syrup
for the family.

64
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,714
- And really working hard
and playing hard.

65
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,784
And that's what we do
when we're out here.

[lively Irish folk music]

- Dave: Saint Paddy's Day,
though,

68
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,723
it's kind of like
a family reunion.

69
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,391
- Jennifer:
Saint Paddy's weekend

70
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,596
is really about coming home,
and it's all family.

71
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,531
And so the conversations
are deeper.

72
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,899
You know everybody.

73
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,568
Even if there's 100 people,
you still know everybody.

74
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,905
Once we step in to the gathering
into the sugar shack,

75
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,507
I mean, as soon
as we're in there,

76
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,842
it's food and companionship.

77
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,579
- Betty: We thank you for the
beauty of this surrounding.

78

The forethought of our ancestors
that came to this country.

79
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,987
- Jennifer: Our family has a lot
of storytellers,

80
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,892
and it took the storytelling
and put it up on the walls.

81
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,627
- I picked out this one,

82
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,863
and my four stones there
are for my daughters.

83
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,065
I have four daughters.

[gentle harp music]

85
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,344
- Its whole purpose
is to keep us together.

86
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,547
- I'm sure that's why our family
has remained as close

87
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,048
as we have been.

88
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:13,220
If we didn't have this, it would
be weddings and funerals.

89
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,655
- Bridget: It's all about
passing it

90
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,990
to the next generation
and spending time together.

91
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,194
There's nothing better
than that.
