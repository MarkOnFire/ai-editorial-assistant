00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:09,309
- Mary Burns: I have a very
deep-seated love of water.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:15,482
I just feel really blessed to
live along the Manitowish River.

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,384
I'm Mary Burns.

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,253
I am a fiber artist.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,922
I love to weave.

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,858
I've been a weaver
since I was 17.

8
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:34,268
When I'm at the loom, it feels
like a spiritual experience.

9
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,904
It's really deep within me.

10
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:42,009
It's something I probably
couldn't live without.

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,744
[river rushing]

12
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,749
Without water,
none of us would be here.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,085
I saw that women
across the world

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:56,089
were doing wonderful work
advocating for water

15
00:00:56,156 --> 00:01:00,961
and not getting the
recognition that they deserve.

16
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,566
It was time for an exhibit
to honor these women.

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
We have 29 portraits.

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,808
Scientists, oceanographers,

19
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:20,447
activists, Native American
water walkers.

20
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:25,319
Grandmother Josephine
Mandamin-ba walked around

21
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,687
each of the Great Lakes.

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,456
She walked the length
of the Mississippi.

23
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:33,994
She was an amazing voice
for water and for women.

24
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,269
Through this high-tech
Jacquard weaving,

25
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,171
I can tell more stories.

26
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:49,376
I can put so much detail into
these weavings that you can look

27
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:54,381
at Rachel Carson and you know
that's Rachel Carson.

28
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,717
I start with a combination

29
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,120
of photographs and drawing,
and I simplify it

30
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,490
because I can't weave
the thousands of shades

31
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,893
that are in a photograph.

32
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,362
And I wouldn't want to.

33
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,199
I mean, I want this
to be an interpretation.

34
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:16,069
So this would be the
lightest value here.

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,207
In her hair here,
it's the darkest value.

36
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,311
When Nafisa Barot
from Gujarat, India,

37
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:28,382
witnessed people dying
from lack of water.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,754
And it was so appalling to her,
as it would be to anybody,

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,789
but she took action.

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,264
Monica Lewis-Patrick
is considered

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,134
the water warrior of Detroit.

42
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:52,506
The cost of water was
going up astronomically.

43
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,908
People were having
their water shut off,

44
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,978
and she organized to fight that.

45
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:02,149
And they're still working
to make it a right

46
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:06,153
for people to have access
to fresh drinking water.

47
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,622
Some of these women
are so brave.

48
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,093
I mean, it just humbles me what
some of these women have done.

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,165
In Honduras, Berta Cáceres
organized peaceful protests

50
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:21,235
to safeguard sacred waterways.

51
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,605
They murdered her.

52
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,978
In Honduras, over 100
environmental activists

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,713
were murdered.

54
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,051
In her weaving, I depict her
with her mother.

55
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:42,055
Because her mother was
her greatest inspiration.

56
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:47,127
They worked to bring
international pressure to bear.

57
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,399
Well, they were able
to stop the dam.

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,636
I've been getting
wonderful response.

59
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,172
A lot of emotional response.

60
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,177
People are very touched
by the women and their stories.

61
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,515
It's important for people
to see that everyday people

62
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,717
can make a difference.

63
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:15,189
The stories of these women
should help people

64
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,724
start to take those steps.

65
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,093
