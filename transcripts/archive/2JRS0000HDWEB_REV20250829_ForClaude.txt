- What's interesting as

5
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,667
I think back on the years that
I spent in a country school

6
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,203
is that they were much more

7
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:41,708
than places where children
learned academics.

8
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,243
That was important.

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,113
We learned our academics
and we learned them well.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,183
But the country school
children themselves

11
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,252
formed what I would today call
a learning community.

12
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,388
We didn't talk about it
at the time.

13
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,956
We worked together.

14
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,291
Young and old working together.

15
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,626
Those who learned well
and those who learned less well

16
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,794
working together.

17
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,963
Teacher and parents
working together.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,264
It was a group of people

19
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:08,001
who all wanted
this school to succeed.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,940
The kids that graduated
from these country schools

21
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,676
almost all of them
were farm kids

22
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,312
and when they went
back to the farm

23
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,215
they knew what community meant

24
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,251
because they had experienced
it for eight years

25
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,886
in the country school.

26
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,189
And thus,
they were the foundation

27
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:33,460
for the development of
what community really meant

28
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,495
in the rural areas.

29
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,031
Beyond that connection,

30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,401
the country school
was the center,

31
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,405
social center, academic center
for the entire community.

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,809
And not only was it
the social center

33
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,211
where everybody went
to the Christmas program

34
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,181
and all the other events
that went on at this school,

35
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:58,952
but the school gave
the community an identity.

36
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,522
And when the schools closed,

37
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,291
a little bit
of that identity was lost.

38
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,628
In fact, quite a bit
of that identity was lost.

39
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,999
And the idea of a community
of learners working together

40
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:16,403
as an example of what
a larger community might be

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,805
and how it would interact

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,074
and how people would
help each other

43
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,976
and people would
care for each other

44
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,612
and people would <i>know</i> each other

45
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,015
and know each other well.

46
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,985
A little bit of that
was lost, as well.

[chalk on blackboard]

60
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,082
- I want to start in 1938

61
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,753
because in that year,
I was a little four-year-old

62
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,489
and I would stand out
by the country road

63
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,960
that went by our place and
I'd wait for the kids to come

64
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,762
that were on their way
to school.

65
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,064
And one young lad
I remember well.

66
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,600
His name was Mike Korleski,

67
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,836
and he would stop
and he would chat with me

68
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,871
and I thought that was
absolutely fantastic.

69
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,876
Add another year and I'm now,
I'm just five years old.

70
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,645
I have twin brothers

71
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,148
and I think my mother was more
than happy to get rid of me.

72
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,651
And so now,
I'm standing out by the road

73
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,386
because this time

74
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,821
I'm not waiting
just to talk with the kids

75
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,256
I will be walking with them.

76
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,226
Unfortunately, I wasn't one
to ever comb my hair,

77
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,094
I had more hair in those days.

78
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,865
And my mother said,
"If you're going to go to school

79
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,333
you gotta comb your hair."

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,403
So I combed my hair
and I had a cap,

81
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,405
pretty much like I'm wearing
right now,

82
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,308
And so I put on my cap, my hat,
and I waited for Mike--

83
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,976
and there were other kids--
to come

84
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,778
and I walked along with them
to school.

85
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,380
I mean, it was a fantastic event

86
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,051
because we had about a mile
along the country road

87
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,919
and we would listen to the birds

88
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,456
and we look for a rabbit
and all that sort of thing

89
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,525
and then we got
to the top of Miller's Hill,

90
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,862
which down at the bottom
of the hill was the school.

91
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,296
And what was common

92
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:00,167
was for the teacher
to ring the bell at 8:30

93
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,637
because we had to
get to school by 9 o'clock.

94
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,739
And I have never forgotten

95
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,176
that sound of the school bell
that first day

96
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,612
when I'm on my way to school.

97
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,516
[school bell rings]
Ding dong, ding dong.

98
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,917
And it has a little valley there

99
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,655
and you could hear it echoing
down the valley, ding dong.

100
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,390
I mean, I was--

101
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,295
Well, what could be better
than to be able to go to school?

102
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,930
And I would hear
that school bell.

103
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,865
And now Mike said, "Well,
we better hustle on

104
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,235
because we gotta get
there before 9 o'clock."

105
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,437
And we--
Finally, we got to the school,

106
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,439
pulled open
the big ol' school door,

107
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,008
Mike said,
"Now here's what you do.

108
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,409
"You go right in here now,

109
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,811
I'll introduce you
to Ms. Piechowski."

110
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,979
That was our teacher.

111
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,415
Old, old woman,
18 years old,

112
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,051
just out of Normal School.
[chuckles]

113
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,053
But to me,
she was an old woman.

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,922
Black hair,
beautiful young woman.

115
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,924
And she says, "Hi, Jerry,

116
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,226
so glad that you can
be a part of this school."

117
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,362
"There'll be one more kid
in your class," she said,

118
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,799
"Norman Hudziak, he's going
to be in the class with you."

119
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,334
The first thing
that I noticed

120
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,437
was the smell
of the freshly oiled floor,

121
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,973
I've never forgotten that smell

122
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,842
because the school board
would have done that

123
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,846
in cleaning the school in
preparation for the fall term.

124
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,647
And now I meet some
of the other kids.

125
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,815
Clair Jenks is there.

126
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,218
Clair is probably
in fourth, fifth grade

127
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:28,422
and Clair was-- well,
he took it upon himself

128
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,093
to initiate the first graders,

129
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,896
I didn't realize that
at the time.

130
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,565
And I need to back up
a little bit and say that

131
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,901
at home
if you wanted a drink of water,

132
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,069
we didn't have indoor plumbing,

133
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,937
never had plumbing
as long as I was home.

134
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,540
If you wanted a drink of water,
you went to the water pail

135
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,542
that sat by the sink
and there was a dipper

136
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,077
and you took a drink of water.

137
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,312
I was thirsty and I was
looking for a water pail.

138
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,680
There wasn't any water pail.

139
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,517
And Clair said, "Well, now,
if you want a drink of water,

140
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,684
here's what you do."

141
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,887
And I saw this water cooler.

142
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,722
I'd never seen
such a thing as that,

143
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,724
just a beautiful water cooler.

144
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,326
I walked over there and I says,
"How do you work that thing?"

145
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,895
He said, "Ah, let me show you."

146
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,697
He said, "You see that
little thing in the middle?"
- I see that.

147
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,699
- "Get your nose
close as you can to that

148
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,536
and I'll push the button
and you'll see how it works."

149
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,404
And so I leaned over

150
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,506
anticipating to get
a drink of water

151
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,577
and what I got was
a shot of water in my nose.

152
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,812
And I was sputtering away,

153
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,548
and Ms. Piechowski
didn't see this.

154
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,883
This was not something
that was a good thing to do,

155
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,520
obviously, but that was
something that Clair Jenks did.

156
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,523
Now, I'm sitting
in my little seat

157
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,125
way in the front of the school.

158
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,127
The early grades were
in the front of the school.

159
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:41,795
The older kids were in the back.

160
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,864
Bigger seats,
smaller seats in the front.

161
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,534
And I'm looking around
the school to see what I see.

162
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,269
I was always curious.

163
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,972
And up on the wall
right in front of me,

164
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,942
is a blackboard
that stretches across

165
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,444
the whole front end
of the schoolroom.

166
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,613
And on either side
of that schoolroom

167
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,215
was a picture of Lincoln

168
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,450
and a picture of Washington

169
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,018
and to the left were maps,

170
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,621
if you pulled them down
like a shade

171
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,723
and there you would see
the United States

172
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,258
or you could see the world.

173
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,326
It was wonderful.

174
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,894
Especially later, I learned

175
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,896
if you pulled them down
and let go real quick,

176
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,198
it'd go [snapping] and it'd go
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,

177
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,702
but you didn't want the teacher
around when you did that.

178
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,038
And on the other side
of the room was this huge clock.

179
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,041
Ms. Piechowski pointed out to us

180
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:32,446
that we want you to be quiet
at times in this school

181
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,915
and we want you
to be so quiet

182
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,984
that all you will hear

183
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,486
is this old clock.

184
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,422
Tick tock, tick tock.

185
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,765
In the back of the school
is our library.

186
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,136
Three, maybe four
shelves of books.

187
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,740
That was it,
but it was wonderful.

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,410
One of the first exercises
that Ms. Piechowski did,

189
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,280
as I think back to it,
it was a stroke of genius.

190
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,383
She was teaching us how to read,
Norman and me.

191
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,853
And she laid out on the floor
a highway

192
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,390
and she gave each of us
a little car,

193
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,991
never had a little car before,

194
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,594
we're to drive this
car along this road

195
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,730
and about every two, three
inches there was the word,

196
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,834
"and", "the", "but", et cetera.

197
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,869
And you'd get to that
and she'd say,

198
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,039
"Well, you can't drive on
until you know that word."

199
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,874
Within, I don't know,
couple months

200
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,810
I could read basic stuff,
<i>Dick and Jane</i> .

201
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,079
The little <i>Dick and Jane</i> books.

202
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,581
See Jane run.

203
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,416
See Dick do something.

204
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,951
[laughs]

205
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:47,054
I was one of those
weird kids, I think,

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,590
as I got to know
a lot of other kids.

207
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,325
I loved school
from the moment

208
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,662
I walked through the door
and I have never gotten over it.

209
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,633
The idea of learning
something new, to me,

210
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,936
is still just
absolutely fantastic.

211
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:07,908
And each day in school,
I was learning something new.

212
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,111
This is not a good thing
that I'm about to tell now

213
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,779
and if the teacher
had caught me...

214
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,181
Then I would have
gotten into trouble.

215
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,184
Today I would've been expelled.

216
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,852
I was out in the pump house

217
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,188
where we kept the wood
for the wood stove.

218
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:22,623
I'm picking up
some kindling wood

219
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,958
because the teacher said,
"Now you all have these duties

220
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,827
to do and as a first-grader,
you can carry

221
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,029
some kindling wood in
for the stove."

222
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,764
And so I'm out in the woodshed

223
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,132
and Clair Jenks comes along

224
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,068
and he takes my cap off my head.

225
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,805
Now, I had one cap,
it was my favorite cap

226
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,575
and I don't care
who this kid is,

227
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,677
he's now got my cap,
he stands there,

228
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,412
[mock laughing]

229
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,648
and I pick up
a piece of kindling,

230
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,950
I whop him over the head.

231
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,186
He falls to his knees,

232
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,721
tears coming down his face.

233
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,257
I said don't do that again.

234
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,661
I thought he was going to tell
the teacher what had happened,

235
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,962
He didn't.

236
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,432
He didn't and we became good
friends after that.

237
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,900
You don't do that today.

238
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,369
And I don't advocate that
sort of treatment for a bully.

239
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,005
But at the time
it seemed appropriate.

240
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,108
Coming home from school,
we'd often talk about the day.

241
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,945
"Well," I said,
"Clair Jenks needs help

242
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,247
because he just pulled
the dirtiest trick on me."

243
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,583
And my pa said, "Ya' know,
Clair's like that."

244
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,384
[laughing]

245
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,420
And that's about
all there was to it.

246
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,521
I didn't tell him that

247
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,623
I whopped him over the head
with a stick.

248
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,326
My mother would not have
appreciated me

249
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,128
whopping anybody over the head
with anything.

250
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,532
But I solved the problem
in my own way.

251
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,068
Nobody messes with my hat.

252
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,840
[recess bell rings]

253
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,821
Arriving at school,
I carried a lunch bucket,

254
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,456
as all of us did.

255
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,791
The lunch bucket I had
was a lard pail,

256
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,727
five-pound lard pail.

257
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,028
My mother cleaned it out.

258
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,530
When we'd arrive at school--

259
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,633
and let's say this is August
or September, the fall--

260
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,068
put our lunch bucket
on the shelf

261
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,271
in the entryway to the school.

262
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,340
And then,
promptly at 9 o'clock,

263
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,877
we would all assemble
around the flagpole

264
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,848
because we would
lift the flag up the pole.

265
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,151
An eighth-grader
had that duty

266
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,454
and I need to take some time
in a bit and talk about duties

267
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,523
because there was a
progression of duties.

268
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,460
You started out in first
grade with cleaning erasers,

269
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,095
nobody remembers
how you do that,

270
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,097
you take two erasers
and you pound 'em together,

271
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,766
and big cloud of dust
and you sneeze

272
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,234
and you have all kinds
of problems.

273
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,203
And that was first graders' job.

274
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,504
And then, you graduated.

275
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,673
By the time you were
in second, third grade

276
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,875
you had graduated to
sweeping out the outhouses,

277
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,645
quite a mid-management
kind of proposition

278
00:12:58,712 --> 00:12:59,980
that you were required to do.

279
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,381
And you felt pretty good
about it

280
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,383
because no longer
did you have to suffer

281
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,686
the dust of the erasers.

282
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,021
And then about
fourth grade, third grade,

283
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,024
you carried in wood and that's
another very important duty.

284
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,293
The teacher had you believing
that each one of those duties,

285
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,128
as you progressed up the ladder,

286
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,131
was more significant
and important.

287
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,735
And it was true and you carried
in water in the same way.

288
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:22,936
So we had all these duties,

289
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,973
by the time you
got to eighth grade

290
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,510
your duty, highest
level duty of all,

291
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,814
you tried to work hard
to get to that point

292
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:39,086
was putting up the flag and
taking it down in the afternoon.

293
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,155
And so we're now all gathered
around the flagpole,

294
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,791
little eighth-grader,
big smile on her face,

295
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,627
runs the flag up the pole

296
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,562
and we say
the <i>Pledge of Allegiance</i> .

297
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,264
We do that every morning.

298
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,432
Now, if she had allowed

299
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,068
the flag to touch the ground

300
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,540
at any point
in that whole experience

301
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,242
back to erasers.

302
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,711
[laughing]

303
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,448
We all file
into the schoolroom.

304
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,019
We're quiet.
We learned how to be quiet.

305
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,189
Bring the first-graders up
front and they would recite,

306
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,292
was the word used, and we
would work our way through

307
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,960
all of the classes.

308
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,895
Want to say a word
about the teachers

309
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:25,532
because I gained a lot
from these teachers.

310
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,934
A different one every year;

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,936
I don't know why
they came and went,

312
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,737
except some of them got married.

313
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:34,575
Early 1900s, we started what
are called "Normal Schools,"

314
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:38,979
two-year schools for instruction
in country school teaching.

315
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,081
So let's say they graduated
from high school

316
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,516
when they were 17;

317
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,153
Well, they were 18, 19 when
they were out there teaching.

318
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,689
The teachers tended to live with
the farmers in the community.

319
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,692
Sometimes they would go from
farm to farm in the early days.

320
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,662
In my experience, they tended
to live with McKinley Jenks

321
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:59,166
who lived less than
a quarter-mile from the school.

322
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,034
And she walked to school,
of course.

323
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,004
She didn't have a car
and walked through the woods

324
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,573
from Mac Jenks' place
to the school.

325
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,978
Arriving before the students,
generally at 7:30, 8 o'clock.

326
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,980
And the first thing
she would have to do

327
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,350
would be to start the fire
in the stove.

328
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,719
The teachers were the janitors,
interestingly enough.

329
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,587
They enlisted the students
to help

330
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,289
with the janitorial work,
of course,

331
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,058
but they were responsible
for starting the fire

332
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,293
the first thing in the morning.

333
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,329
And it was 35 below zero
outside, my gosh,

334
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,566
that school was
just deathly cold.

335
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,067
She'd get the fire going.

336
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,837
Hoping by 9 o'clock
it would be somewhat warm

337
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:40,207
so that we could learn
what needed to learned that day.

338
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,510
And she also was in charge
of teaching us

339
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,713
the games that we
played outside,

340
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,918
she generally umpired
the softball games.

341
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,888
So, now she's the janitor
and the recreation director

342
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,324
and, of course, in charge
of teaching all of us.

343
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:00,794
If you fall down and skin your
knee, she was the school nurse.

344
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,397
Would find some tape
and Mercurochrome--

345
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,299
nobody knows
what that is anymore

346
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,935
but the teacher was
the glue, the key

347
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,437
that kept it all together.

348
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,605
They were remarkable people.

349
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:12,773
Think about this:

350
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,309
they had to know
first-grade material,

351
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,010
eighth-grade material.

352
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,413
They led spelling bees.

353
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,849
They introduced us
to the literature,

354
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,351
if we could call it that,
on the bookshelves,

355
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:27,087
taught us how to read, taught
us how to do long division,

356
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,355
then geography.

357
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,758
We had, really, a pretty decent
geography experience.

358
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,893
We had history.

359
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,795
We studied Wisconsin history.

360
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:37,164
One of the interesting things
about my school,

361
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,601
when I started some of the kids
could barely speak English.

362
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,269
Those from Polish families.

363
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,770
English was
their second language.

364
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,038
They didn't know that.

365
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,840
The Norwegian kids,
some of them came.

366
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,609
They couldn't speak
hardly a word of English.

367
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,077
They spoke Norwegian.

368
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,746
The German kids,
what do you do as a teacher?

369
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:55,315
My gosh!
You can't understand the kid.

370
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,618
They survived all that.

371
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:03,190
There was tremendous respect
for the teacher.

372
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,959
Whatever she said
was law.

373
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,296
Whether it was right or wrong,
we did it.

374
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,831
And why?

375
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,800
Because if we disobeyed the
teacher, generally speaking,

376
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,870
before we got home
our parents knew

377
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:20,974
and we caught holy whatever
for disobeying.

378
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,911
That's the connection
the community provided

379
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,280
in the support of the teacher.

380
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,148
Now it was not fear.

381
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,418
You'd say, "Well,
you were afraid of the teacher."

382
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,853
No, that was not it.

383
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,588
We're not afraid of the teacher.

384
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,723
We were respectful
of the teacher.

385
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,692
And it was not a dour,

386
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,495
everybody was sad,
looking at their feet.

387
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,431
No, at appropriate times,
we hooted and laughed.

388
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:47,501
And, of course,
why wouldn't we?

389
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:51,271
Just as today, some--
we call them slow learners--

390
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,540
They just had difficulty
learning,

391
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,510
and there weren't any special
teachers to work with them.

392
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,911
There was just one teacher.

393
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,213
But if she was wise--

394
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,149
and they were,
every one of them that I knew--

395
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,786
she would assign
this little guy or gal

396
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,754
who was having trouble reading.

397
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,489
Say I was in seventh grade,
she'd say,

398
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,426
"Jerry, would you spend
a little time with Mabel."

399
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,428
And then I would
sit down with Mabel

400
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,530
and I would say,
"Now read this line to me."

401
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,832
And she would stumble along,
and I would say,

402
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,501
"Now, this is how
I would read it."

403
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,002
That really works.

404
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,471
Little Mabel,
we played softball together.

405
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,306
Probably every kid
knew each other very well,

406
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,808
knew their families,

407
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,776
knew their dogs, horses,
and the whole schmear.

408
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,312
So little Mabel
is learning how to read.

409
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,314
Doing that, by the time
I was in eighth grade,

410
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,017
I said, "I think
I want to be a teacher."

411
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:40,754
Never got over it;
I taught for 37 years.

412
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,025
As much as we liked
the schoolroom,

413
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,460
to tell you the truth,

414
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,395
we couldn't wait
to get out of the place,

415
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,131
and so recess and lunchtime,
we were outside.

416
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:55,502
For my two brothers and me, my
mother always packed our lunch.

417
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,972
And it would usually be
a jelly sandwich

418
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,208
and maybe a cookie
and something else.

419
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,077
Some of the kids came to school

420
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:08,482
with sandwiches with lard
spread on a piece of bread.

421
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,617
That was their lunch.

422
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,287
'Cause one of the things
we learned

423
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,455
without realizing
we were learning

424
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,759
was that not everybody
has similar circumstances.

425
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,796
Some of us are a lot poorer
than the others.

426
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,366
None of us had much, but some
of these kids had nothing.

427
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,101
So what we would do,

428
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,304
"Have one of my cookies,"

429
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,972
"Have one of my cookies,"

430
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,374
"Here's a sandwich
that I don't need."

431
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,109
That was lunch.

432
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:42,216
Well, it's part of the community
I think is so important

433
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,184
that we were learning
about in school.

434
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,321
Those who needed something,
we should help them.

435
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,956
You wouldn't let
a little kid

436
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,091
sit off to the side
and eat a lard sandwich

437
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:52,626
when you're chomping

438
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,829
on a big ol' jelly sandwich
and homemade chocolate cookie.

439
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,664
There were a couple families
like that,

440
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,066
they just had nothing.

441
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,602
Those lessons not in books

442
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:05,105
were so important
in those country schools.

443
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,741
I've never forgotten them.

444
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:19,253
[child singing
"Away in a Manger"]

445
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,761
Our teacher would
start us planning

446
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,731
for the annual
Christmas Program.

447
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,400
And that program, for her,

448
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,603
was one of the major challenges
of the year

449
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,173
because there were instances

450
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,043
where if the program
was not deemed a success

451
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,713
and was not well-accepted
by the community,

452
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,384
she may not have
her contract renewed

453
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,119
and she knew that.

454
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,556
So she would select the pieces
that we were to recite

455
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:58,158
and the little plays
that we were to do

456
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:01,728
and we would begin practicing
in the afternoon,

457
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,798
say a half an hour
in November, and

458
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:08,602
by the time we got to December
it was the whole afternoon.

459
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:12,606
She was intent that we would
know what we were doing

460
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,875
but you worked your way up
from a first grader

461
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:18,545
saying maybe a couple of lines
and welcoming people

462
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,547
to by the time you were
in eighth grade

463
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,850
you had major roles,
like Joseph.

464
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,818
That was a major role

465
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,087
if you're in the nativity scene
as Joseph.

466
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,323
We had a regular stage
in our school.

467
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,659
Right after Thanksgiving, as we
were preparing for the program,

468
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,394
the school board would
bring the planks down,

469
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,029
nail 'em onto sawhorses,

470
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,332
and they were
a couple feet off the floor

471
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,867
and that was the stage

472
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,068
and the brown curtains in front.

473
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,302
You could pull
the curtains open.

474
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,838
That was a really big deal.

475
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:49,309
Our teacher had several
interesting challenges

476
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,946
because we were
such a mixture of kids.

477
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,049
One of the families that
had moved into the community

478
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:59,786
had an uncanny proficiency
in cussing.

479
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,324
They could swear better than
anybody in the neighborhood.

480
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,159
We were astounded,

481
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,729
my brothers and I
and the other kids of our age,

482
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,865
at how eloquent
these young kids were

483
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:14,268
in their ability to cuss.

484
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,203
Now the teacher
was having a problem

485
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,071
with this particular child

486
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:21,008
because he insisted
on cussing in school

487
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,609
and of course that
was a big "no-no."

488
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,111
He didn't know the difference

489
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:27,381
because at home
that's what was common language.

490
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,816
And so she saw
the Christmas program

491
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:34,555
as an opportunity
to change this kid's direction.

492
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,424
He was maybe in fourth grade,

493
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,826
black hair, skinny little guy

494
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:42,963
and he would talk
in a near whisper

495
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,532
and she wanted him to say
just this one sentence,

496
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,303
"Jesus Christ was born
on Christmas day."

497
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,104
And he would stand up
on the stage

498
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:53,106
and he would say it
in a near whisper

499
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,642
and she would say, "You've gotta
speak louder, George,"

500
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,911
People gotta hear you say that."

501
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:01,281
[imitating George's whisper]
"Jesus Christ was born
on Christmas day."

502
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,317
You couldn't hear
past the third row

503
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,618
what he was mumbling.

504
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:07,554
And so now on the night
of the Christmas program

505
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,791
when the schoolroom
was filled with parents

506
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:14,895
and cousins and aunts and uncles
and bachelor farmers

507
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:16,096
and the whole schmear,

508
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,800
he's on the stage
with the nativity scene.

509
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:22,336
And now with a booming voice

510
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,505
that you could hear
to the outside

511
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,939
he said,

512
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:30,444
"Jesus Kee-rist was born
on Christmas day."

513
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,247
The entire schoolroom
burst into laughter.

514
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,115
The teacher was so embarrassed

515
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,184
she was ready
to crawl under her desk.

516
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,020
It was one of those
memorable moments that,

517
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,422
well, no one ever forgot.

518
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:48,228
On another night,
the teacher that particular year

519
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:51,365
was proficient with piano--
not all of them were.

520
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:55,269
And we had a piano that sat up
to the front of the schoolroom.

521
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,271
An old upright piano.

522
00:23:57,337 --> 00:24:00,807
And mice had built a nest
in the piano,

523
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,710
unknown to any of us.

524
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:10,584
The Christmas program consisted
of a series of recitations.

525
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,920
We call them
"saying our pieces."

526
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:16,590
Little things we memorized,
there were little skits,

527
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:20,093
foolish little skits
that we participated in.

528
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,763
And then, the nativity scene
was the highlight

529
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:27,801
with Joseph on the stage
wearing his dad's bathrobe

530
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,638
and Mary standing next to him,

531
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:38,111
clothed in a sheet
with a bath towel on her head

532
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:41,682
and the naked baby Jesus
in a little pile of straw,

533
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,417
a doll on the stage

534
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,987
and the teacher
announced to all of us,

535
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:49,389
"This is a solemn moment.

536
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,626
"There will be no giggling.

537
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:53,894
"There will be no laughing.

538
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:54,895
"There will be no smiling.

539
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:57,164
"There will be nothing.

540
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,234
"You will sit quietly
in reverence

541
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,637
of what you're
going to see on the stage."

542
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,472
And Joseph came out
and Mary came out

543
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,407
and they're standing there
and all is well.

544
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:10,444
And we commenced to sing
"Away in the Manger,"

545
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,513
teacher at the piano.

546
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,883
And then, the little mouse
resting in the piano,

547
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:18,218
he did not care for
"Away in the Manger"

548
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:22,856
or anything else and
so he crawled out of the piano

549
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,159
and he stuck his little head
over the side.

550
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:30,497
And those of us in the
front row began to giggle,

551
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:34,268
violating the rule
that the teacher had set.

552
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:37,804
And we noticed the back
of her neck getting red.

553
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:41,341
And then the mouse
crawled down the piano

554
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:44,444
and crawled up onto the stage.

555
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:47,781
And now the audience
began to see the mouse.

556
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,484
A mouse without
any sense of reverence

557
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,853
for the program
that was taking place,

558
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,290
a mouse who was not listening
to "Away in the Manger,"

559
00:25:56,356 --> 00:26:00,327
that we were singing
so wonderfully well.

560
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,062
And then the teacher
stopped playing

561
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:05,299
and she looked around
and she too began to laugh

562
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:09,436
and the whole audience was in--
just hooted in laughter

563
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:11,972
and it was the funniest
thing that ever happened

564
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,375
and so, finally, teacher
went back to the piano,

565
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:19,713
Joseph and Mary resumed their
places 'round the baby Jesus

566
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,149
and we continued singing

567
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:26,019
? Away in the Manger
? No place for his head

568
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,122
with reverence and quiet,

569
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,793
exactly as
the teacher had suggested.

570
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:37,231
And then,
after the Christmas program

571
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:41,034
Santa Claus--
There was always a Santa Claus.

572
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,203
One of the teacher's jobs
was to select somebody

573
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,772
in the community to
be the Santa Clause.

574
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,608
He would come into
the schoolroom yelling,

575
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,576
"Merry Christmas."

576
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,645
He would first run
around the schoolhouse

577
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:53,380
shaking bells.

578
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,781
Oh, my gosh!

579
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,917
"Santa has arrived!"
the teacher would say,

580
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,852
and us older kids
would roll our eyes.

581
00:26:58,919 --> 00:26:59,987
And Santa would come in

582
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,523
stomping his boots
and run up to the teacher

583
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,291
and give her a big kiss.

584
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:08,262
Her face would get all red and
everybody would clap and cheer.

585
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:09,730
It was part of the deal.

586
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,066
And then there was a big sack
that Santa carried on his back

587
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,936
of presents and so the
teacher had a present

588
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:18,071
for each of the kids,
some little thing.

589
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,107
I mean it was a big deal.

590
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:22,976
It was always the Friday night
before Christmas.

591
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:25,045
That's when the program
was held.

592
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:28,348
You hoped for some praise
from your parents

593
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:33,687
and praise for German folks
was not all that forthcoming.

594
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,022
It was the other way around.

595
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,356
If you screwed up,

596
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:39,126
you would hear about it
no matter what you were doing.

597
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:41,562
But if you did
something really well,

598
00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:44,298
the best you could expect
would be

599
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:47,134
maybe a head shake,
something like that.

600
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:51,772
We just accepted that but
individually you felt good.

601
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:55,676
We were actors
of the first order

602
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,979
and I say that
not jokingly because

603
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:02,950
that experience that we all had

604
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,452
as shy little country kids
who had very little

605
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,722
in the way of connecting
with other people,

606
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,359
the opportunity to
stand on the stage

607
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:15,028
and sing, say your piece,
be a part of a play,

608
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:16,763
whatever it was,

609
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,999
was something
for me personally

610
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,602
that I've never forgotten.

611
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:25,906
How valuable it was to
be able to say something

612
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,509
in front of a group

613
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,244
without keeling over, fainting,

614
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,746
or having stage fright
or whatever happens.

615
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,615
Every kid that went
to a country school

616
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,518
had an opportunity,
eight opportunities, really,

617
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:41,455
each year, to do something,
if not a lot of things,

618
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:44,091
in front of a live audience.

619
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,129
[old radio music]

620
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,241
- WHA radio announcer:
Hello, boys and girls.

621
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:02,976
I can just remember
way back last May

622
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,678
when I said goodbye
to all of you

623
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,113
and hope that you were all

624
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,549
going to have a grand time
during the summer.

625
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,651
Here we are back again

626
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,786
and with all our old friends
from last year,

627
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:17,658
we have a lot of new friends
in our radio class today.

628
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,028
- Way back in 1939
when I was in first grade,

629
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,630
I noticed as
a little five-year-old

630
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:28,268
that there was this radio
on the teacher's desk.

631
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:31,071
It was a Philco radio
and there were two batteries.

632
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:33,307
The school had no electricity.

633
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,975
Of course,
nobody had electricity.

634
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,743
We didn't have electricity
at home either.

635
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,279
<i>But</i> at 9:30 in the morning,

636
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:45,385
this radio became
the center of the universe

637
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,921
for all the kids in the school.

638
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:52,826
Let's say it's about
25 after 9 on a Monday morning

639
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:56,396
and we are patiently
waiting for the teacher,

640
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,166
who is the only one who
could touch the radio.

641
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,935
No kid would dare
go near the radio.

642
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:03,937
She snaps on the radio.

643
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,339
There's a little static

644
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:09,743
and then promptly at 9:30--
and I've never forgotten this--

645
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,646
this voice, this deep voice
comes on the air,

646
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:16,683
[speaking in deep dramatic tone]
"This is WLBL
of your state station

647
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,986
"in Auburndale, Wisconsin

648
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:23,524
"and today we are once more
featuring Ranger Mac

649
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,595
with his special program
on nature."

650
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,098
Oh, my gosh.

651
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,166
- Ranger Mac:
Hello boys and girls,

652
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:36,236
we're standing at the threshold
of another year.

653
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:39,206
Ranger Mac wishes that each day
of the year ahead

654
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:43,610
may bring you many and many
fine joyous things.

655
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:48,382
That no matter what else
goes on in the world

656
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:53,120
your days may be full of
the joys that rightfully belong

657
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,455
to the youth time of life.

658
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:58,992
- And we all
at the edge of our chairs

659
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,896
are patiently listening
for but a 15-minute program--

660
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:05,432
that's all the longer it was--

661
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:07,034
but it would be on every week

662
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,171
and Ranger Mac would tell us
about things in nature

663
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:13,040
that were new to us.

664
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,309
I mean, we're farm kids!

665
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,244
I mean, we pretty much thought
we knew

666
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:18,612
what nature was all about.

667
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,047
We walked to school and back.

668
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:25,319
We walked with our dads when
we were hunting and fishing.

669
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:29,289
<i>But</i> Ranger Mac would
help us see something

670
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,625
in nature that we didn't see.

671
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:36,630
He also encouraged us to put
together a conservation corner,

672
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:39,166
a nature corner in our school.

673
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,168
And we had a sandbox

674
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,570
and we would stuck
little artificial trees in there

675
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:46,573
and we would bring
little toy animals from home

676
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,710
and we would have
our little nature center.

677
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:52,045
My most wonderful
memories go back,

678
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,381
when I was just
a scrawny little kid,

679
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:57,584
listening to the radio
along with

680
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:04,925
some 50,000 other little kids
all over the state of Wisconsin,

681
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:07,227
tied together by radio.

682
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:10,230
Because we clearly
were isolated.

683
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, we were out there
in the boonies, clearly.

684
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,702
And through radio now,
we were brought together

685
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,039
with a topic that was fantastic:
nature.

686
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,774
My gosh, nature.

687
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,676
Now, cynically,

688
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:25,212
it was a break in what
we were regularly doing--

689
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,480
[laughing]

690
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:29,116
It was different, I mean,
it really was different--

691
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:33,587
and the idea that we were
a part of something much bigger.

692
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,255
?

693
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,791
- WLBL radio announcer:
The <i>Wisconsin School</i>
<i>of the Air</i> presents

694
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:42,596
<i>Journeys in Music Land</i>
with Professor E.B. Gordon.

695
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:44,831
- Professor Gordon:
Good afternoon, boys and girls.

696
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:47,601
You know, something very nice
has happened to us

697
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:49,603
here at the radio station today.

698
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,871
What do you suppose?

699
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:53,440
We have 50 children from
the Carter School up at Markesan

700
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:54,608
visiting us.

701
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:57,077
- Well, Tuesday morning
or Wednesday morning,

702
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,779
I don't know which day it was

703
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,415
but we would have, again,

704
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:04,384
[imitating deep voice]
"WLBL Auburndale,

705
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:07,254
"Today we have an opportunity

706
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:11,425
"to once more participate
with Pop Gordon

707
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,428
and the program is <i>Let's Sing</i> ."

708
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:18,699
Well, how preposterous
to think about the fact

709
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:20,501
that somebody in Madison,

710
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,303
in a wee little studio
with a pianist

711
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,706
would play songs that we,

712
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,909
in the little country
schools all over Wisconsin--

713
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,444
I think beyond--

714
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:33,180
had the opportunity
to sing along with him

715
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,282
and can you imagine
what it would have been like

716
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,085
if you could have traveled
from one school to another

717
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,722
and hear-- again,
thousands of country kids--

718
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:44,691
all singing the same song
at the very same time.

719
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:47,194
I mean, when you think
about that, it's quite amazing

720
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:50,364
'cause we're talking about
the '30s and the '40s

721
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,801
and the idea of social networks,
nobody knew the language

722
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,303
even at that time.

723
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,605
So Professor Gordon
did a wonderful thing.

724
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:02,142
There were little song books
that he would also send out.

725
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:06,180
And then, once a year,
he invited representatives

726
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:09,850
from each country school
to come to Madison,

727
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:13,320
go to the Stock Pavilion
and there would be

728
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,690
several thousand kids
sitting in the Stock Pavilion

729
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:19,927
with a sawdust floor and
Prof. Gordon is on the stage

730
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:23,230
and he's leading
all of these kids

731
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:24,998
in the songs that they had sung.

732
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,568
And, of course,
now they are together doing it.

733
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:31,705
And it was a poignant moment
because now for the first time

734
00:34:31,772 --> 00:34:34,007
the teacher, Pop Gordon,

735
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:37,244
would have the opportunity
to see his students

736
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:42,015
and the students would
see their teacher in person.

737
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,417
- James Schwalbach:
And that brings us

738
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,419
to our little fun period
for today.

739
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:48,322
But up first, let's see
if we have everything all ready.

740
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:50,457
We want to have
a large sheet of paper,

741
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:52,793
just as large
as you can get on your desk

742
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,563
and then to work with:
either crayons or watercolors.

743
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,266
Since we have
such a big sheet of paper,

744
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,835
I want you to use
every single bit of it.

745
00:35:01,902 --> 00:35:03,370
Make your drawing so big

746
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:07,508
that you use up
all of the space on the paper.

747
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:10,310
- And then, James Schwalbach's
program was <i>Let's Draw</i> .

748
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,880
Now, this is almost absurd.

749
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,415
How can you draw something

750
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,784
when somebody's telling
you something on the radio

751
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,052
for heaven's sakes?

752
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,023
He had a wonderful
approach to doing this.

753
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:29,563
We all were taught, "Never ever
color outside of the lines."

754
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,831
"Oh," the teacher would say,

755
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:32,733
"Now here's this thing to color

756
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,869
but don't go outside the line."

757
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:38,605
And Jim Schwalbach
didn't give a rip about lines.

758
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,807
Here's an example
of what he would do.

759
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:42,609
[imitating with deep voice]
He would say, "Now today,

760
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:45,412
"put your heads down
on your desks.

761
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:48,415
"And just think about
what I'm going to tell you now.

762
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:52,152
"Imagine that you are
in an <i>aeroplane</i> ,"

763
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,222
and that's how they
pronounced it in those days

764
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:00,727
"...And you are flying from
Wisconsin all the way to Norway

765
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:02,462
"across the ocean

766
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:06,533
"and you're arriving
in a city called Bergen

767
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,669
"and you get off the plane

768
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:12,039
"and you find
this mountain place

769
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,875
"and you hear music

770
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:21,815
"and the place is
Edvard Greig's place in Norway,

771
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,785
the composer,
the Norwegian composer."

772
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,387
["Morning Mood" <i>Peer Gynt Suite</i> ]
And at that moment,

773
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:30,924
Jim Schwalbach
puts on the Victrola,

774
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,863
the 78 record,
one of Edvard Greig's pieces

775
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,066
and the kids listen
to this music and he says,

776
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,368
"You're going down
to his studio.

777
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:43,437
You're going to
meet Edvard Greig.

778
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:46,039
You're hearing his music."

779
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:49,009
I mean, we're thinking,
"Whoa, what is this all about?"

780
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,411
And then he says, "Okay."

781
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,881
Turns off the music,

782
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:55,148
"Lift up your heads.

783
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,751
"You've got a piece of paper
in front of you now.

784
00:36:57,818 --> 00:37:00,420
Draw what you just heard."

785
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,957
That is the most creative thing
I ever heard anybody do.

786
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:07,561
"Draw what you just heard."
How do you draw music?

787
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,296
But we all did.

788
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:10,964
It broke so many rules.

789
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:13,033
I'm sure the teacher
was rolling her eyes.

790
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,335
"Don't worry about any lines.

791
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,770
"Don't worry about anything.

792
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,505
But draw what you heard."

793
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,174
Oh, my gosh!

794
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,912
But Prof. Gordon and Schwalbach,
they introduced us to the arts

795
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:28,048
in a way that
we didn't even realize

796
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:30,751
we were being introduced
to the arts.

797
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:33,320
And people criticize
the country school

798
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:36,957
for its lack of breadth
in curriculum.

799
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:43,397
And <i>The School of the Air</i>
added a fantastic dimension

800
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:45,232
to that breadth.

801
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:48,468
And people say, "Well, all you
studied in the country school

802
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,103
was reading, writing,
and arithmetic."

803
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,772
We did study those,

804
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,876
but we also studied geography
and we studied science

805
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,245
and we studied all kinds
of things that went way beyond

806
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,747
reading, writing,
and arithmetic.

807
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:05,819
And music, nature, and art
were provided by WHA Radio.

808
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:14,027
And I, today, am forever
grateful that that happened.

809
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,934
[clock ticking]

810
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,313
What kid did not
look forward to recess?

811
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,449
In fact, we would sit there

812
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,951
and about quarter after 10,

813
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:40,621
you could see
a bunch of little heads

814
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,523
looking at
that big Regulator clock

815
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:46,126
[tick tock, tick tock]
and wondering,

816
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:48,962
"Oh, my gosh.
It's still 15 minutes."

817
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,697
[chuckles]

818
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,000
Recess was a big deal.

819
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,536
I don't think of a game
that we didn't all play

820
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:57,104
<i>together</i> .

821
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,440
One of our favorite games,
we called it Anti-I-Over,

822
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,211
where you have two teams,
one on each side of a building,

823
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,013
and the building was
usually the pump house

824
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,948
because the school was too tall.

825
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,216
So the idea was

826
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,684
you had a rubber ball

827
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,986
and you threw it
over the building in such a way

828
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:15,989
that it had to bounce
on the roof on the other side

829
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:19,493
and if someone caught it,
and they usually did,

830
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,362
then they would run around
to the other side

831
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:25,799
and touch one of us with
the ball or throw the ball at us

832
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,935
and then that person
joined the other side

833
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:29,870
and that was Anti-I-Over.

834
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:32,840
And that was just
great, great fun.

835
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,242
We played a lot
of other games, too.

836
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,444
We played Kick the Can.

837
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,313
That's language
you still use today

838
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:40,647
kick the can
down the road.

839
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,482
Well, it was a game
that we played

840
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:45,118
and it was a kind of
hide and seek thing.

841
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:47,621
The person that was it
would count off to 25

842
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:50,624
and everybody went and hid and
then you went looking for them

843
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:54,127
and if you were too far away
looking for somebody

844
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:57,097
another kid would come up
and kick the can.

845
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:01,635
The teacher was by and large
out there playing with us

846
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,303
and showing us
how to do these games

847
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,972
from the time
that we were little tikes.

848
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,139
There were many.

849
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:07,774
Drop the Handkerchief
was another one.

850
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:09,643
Run, Sheep, Run was another one.

851
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,311
In the winter,
we played Fox and Geese,

852
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:13,780
and snowball fights,
and all that kind of stuff.

853
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:18,752
However, once we got to March,
softball took over.

854
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:22,155
We did not play
what we called hardball.

855
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,657
And why?

856
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:27,227
Because well, we couldn't afford
it, I guess, to have a baseball,

857
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:28,962
but nobody had a glove.

858
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,697
We didn't know about gloves.

859
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,267
You could catch a softball
with your bare hands

860
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,702
but a hardball
that was another thing.

861
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,437
So there wasn't any baseball.

862
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:40,440
At any given year,
we'd have probably a dozen maybe

863
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,342
that were playing softball.

864
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,712
And a six and six would work,
but not very well.

865
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,614
So that's what we did Work Up.

866
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:49,516
Work Up was
one of those games where

867
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:52,119
let's say that you said, "Well,
today's my turn to be batter."

868
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:54,688
And as long as you were able
to hit the ball

869
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:57,324
and run around the bases,
you stayed as the batter.

870
00:40:57,391 --> 00:41:00,327
As soon as you were out,
then you moved on.

871
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:02,863
So everybody moved around.

872
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,032
If you were out in the outfield,
left field,

873
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:06,200
you move to center field.

874
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:07,501
Then you'd be in right field.

875
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,403
Then you moved to shortstop,
and so on.

876
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,039
So everybody got a chance
to play every position

877
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:14,208
and everybody got a chance
to bat and pitch,

878
00:41:14,274 --> 00:41:15,609
and all the rest of it.

879
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,678
It was a wonderful way

880
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,680
to learn how to play
every position.

881
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:22,416
If you're in first grade
and you want to play ball,

882
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,853
you could play ball and somebody
would show you how to do it.

883
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:29,323
And they'd show you how to hold
a bat, how to swing the bat.

884
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,992
And you didn't have to run
all the way to first base.

885
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,760
Halfway was good enough.

886
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:38,098
And also you got as many strikes
as it took to hit the ball.

887
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,834
Now, the ball diamond itself,

888
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:43,437
first base you encountered

889
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:48,375
a box elder tree that
was about 15 feet tall, scrawny.

890
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:49,743
Once you got to first base,

891
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,545
which was quite an achievement

892
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,747
'cause it was a fair hike
and it was uphill

893
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:55,315
to get to first base.

894
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:58,819
Now, to go to second base,
you had to go further uphill.

895
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:03,290
And second base was a black oak
tree of some considerable size.

896
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:06,293
And if you thought you were
going to slide into second base

897
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,429
like you maybe had read about
in the paper someplace,

898
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:11,698
well you're not going to slide
into second base

899
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:13,267
without killing yourself.

900
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,735
So you would hustle
toward second base

901
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:17,771
and then quietly come up to it
and hold on to it

902
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,409
because you were off base,
not when you stepped off base,

903
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:25,212
but when you were no longer
holding on to the tree,

904
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:27,381
that was a little
special rule that we had.

905
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:28,849
Now once you got to second base

906
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,552
the idea was
that you ought to have it

907
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:34,354
a little bit easier the rest
of the way around the bases.

908
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:37,157
So third base
was a white oak tree

909
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,293
and it was right against
the pump house

910
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,361
and that was downhill now,

911
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:43,463
and the distance
wasn't as great.

912
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,333
And then, third base,
home was even further downhill,

913
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,935
as it should be.

914
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,771
If you can get to third base,
you oughtn't have to run uphill.

915
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:52,272
You can run back downhill.

916
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:55,509
And if you knew how to hit the
ball, and some of us did,

917
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:59,546
you'd hit it so that it would
only fly about 8, 10 feet high

918
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:02,449
because otherwise it would
end up in one of these trees

919
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:04,585
and if you hit it
about 10 feet high

920
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:07,020
it might get over the fence,
out on the road.

921
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:10,490
And that was a home run
and that was a really big deal.

922
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:15,429
We played on that diamond
all spring on up through May.

923
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:18,732
And we played with the neighbor
schools on occasion.

924
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:21,602
And our teacher,
Faith Jenks, at the time,

925
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:25,172
was a friend of the teacher
at the Dopp School,

926
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,140
which was the other side
of Wild Rose.

927
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:30,043
And the Dopp School
had never been here before,

928
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,846
to this place,
to this Chain O' Lake School.

929
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:35,549
They had never
seen our ballpark--

930
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:38,852
oh, "park" is the wrong word--
our ball diamond.

931
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:42,990
And so they came over here
in the teacher's car.

932
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,392
And the teacher got out
and she took one look and said,

933
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,095
"We cannot play
on this ball diamond.

934
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:50,297
We cannot play in the woods."

935
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:52,499
And Faith Jenks
just sort of rolled her eyes

936
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:53,800
and didn't say anything.

937
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:57,871
She said finally, "Do you
want to play ball or not?"

938
00:43:57,938 --> 00:44:00,774
I forgot to point out
that the Dopp team came...

939
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:03,443
the catcher came
with a great big mitt.

940
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,579
I mean, the thing
was as big as a watermelon.

941
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,447
My gosh, the first baseman

942
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:10,584
also had a glove and that
was part of the discussion

943
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,752
because Faith said,

944
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:14,688
"We cannot play with a team
that has gloves.

945
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:15,722
We don't have gloves."

946
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:18,258
And, of course,
the Dopp teacher said,

947
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:19,826
"We don't play in the woods."

948
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:21,028
So, the compromise was:

949
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:24,831
playing in the woods;
the gloves stayed.

950
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:27,568
So, Jim Kolka is the pitcher.

951
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,037
I'm on first base.

952
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:32,673
Dave Kolka is on second base.

953
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,775
My brother Donald
is out in the outfield.

954
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,810
My brother Darrel
is out in the outfield.

955
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:40,013
Mildred Swendryznski,
maybe she was catching.

956
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,548
She's a good player.

957
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:45,686
And the first player
they put up to the plate

958
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:47,287
was this enormous kid.

959
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,923
I mean, the kid must have been
five and a half feet tall,

960
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,058
maybe taller than that.

961
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:52,793
I bet the kid weighed
150 pounds.

962
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,729
He's a big kid,
great big ol' farm kid.

963
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:58,765
He grabbed up the bat,
we only had one bat,

964
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:02,236
he grabbed up the bat like it
was a piece of kindling wood

965
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:05,806
and I could see,
standing on first base,

966
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:09,076
there was poor Jim
and he's beginning to perspire,

967
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:13,547
I can see that and I say,
"Jim, throw your screwball."

968
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:17,851
And Jim winds up
and he pitches his screwball.

969
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:20,153
And it went
right over the plate.

970
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,756
And this enormous player,
he whacks this ball.

971
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,992
I mean he hit it
as hard as he could.

972
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:28,061
And one of the advantages
of Jim's screwball

973
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:31,031
is almost always the ball
shot straight up in the air.

974
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:33,600
It did not go straight ahead
like it should.

975
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:37,838
It shot straight up in the air
and it ended up in second base.

976
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:40,340
Remember, second base
is the black oak tree.

977
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,609
It's way up in second base.

978
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:48,649
And the big husky guy
runs all the way around

979
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,952
because the tree, the ball
is stuck up in the tree.

980
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,820
And we're all standing there

981
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,256
as a great quiet
came over the game.

982
00:45:56,323 --> 00:46:00,727
Dave Kolka had been
in this circumstance before.

983
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,796
And he stood under the tree,
looking up.

984
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:04,865
And all of a sudden
there was a little sound

985
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:08,802
and the ball comes drifting
down and he catches it.

986
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,338
And our teacher, Faith,
says, "Out!"

987
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:15,209
And the Dopp teacher
is just furious.

988
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:18,345
And our teacher reminds her,
"I forgot to tell 'ya,

989
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:21,415
but that's the rule
of the tree."

990
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:26,553
Well, the game continued
the rest of the afternoon

991
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:30,524
and we ended up smoking 'em,
something like 10 to five

992
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,459
'cause they
couldn't figure out

993
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:35,195
how to play ball
in the woods.

994
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,001
[school bell rings]

995
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:53,847
We are on the grounds of
the old Chain O' Lake School

996
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:57,050
that I attended
from 1939 to 1947.

997
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:02,756
And it was in 1947
that I was in eighth grade

998
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:06,293
and I had polio in
January of that year

999
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:10,397
and I was out of school
for a couple of months.

1000
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:12,866
My eighth-grade teacher
at the time

1001
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:17,704
brought lessons out to the farm
so I could keep up.

1002
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:20,374
I was going to stay with
the rest of the eighth graders,

1003
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,877
but I was the only one
in eighth grade at the time.

1004
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:25,879
But she did a wonderful thing

1005
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:28,081
in bringing the lessons out
every day

1006
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:32,819
because all eighth-graders
throughout Waushara County

1007
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:36,356
had to take
an eighth-grade examination

1008
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:41,161
before they were allowed
to graduate

1009
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:44,231
and thus be admitted
to high school.

1010
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:48,268
And so I was worried sick
about taking these examinations

1011
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:51,605
because had what I'd been
studying at home been enough

1012
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:53,473
for me to pass tests

1013
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:58,345
in every subject
that was offered at the school?

1014
00:47:58,412 --> 00:48:02,416
And so, the day came when I
with, I don't know--

1015
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:05,352
There must have been a couple
hundred other eighth graders

1016
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:06,954
from around the county

1017
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,557
gathered at
the Wautoma Normal School.

1018
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:13,827
The test began in the morning
at 9 o'clock.

1019
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:15,629
At noon, we had an hour off

1020
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:17,497
and I had a little sack lunch
with me

1021
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:18,966
that my mother had prepared.

1022
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:21,735
And we were forbidden to talk
with each other during lunch

1023
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:23,871
because we couldn't share
what we were doing.

1024
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:25,239
That would be cheating.

1025
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:28,208
So we all sat there quietly,
eating our lunches,

1026
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,777
and then it's back
to taking tests again.

1027
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:33,013
And we did that until
4 o'clock in the afternoon.

1028
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,250
I'm exhausted
and my dad comes to pick me up.

1029
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:37,317
And he's not too happy

1030
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:40,053
because he's wasted
a day planting corn

1031
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,923
and I still didn't know
if I'd passed.

1032
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,192
And a few days later,
in the mail,

1033
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:48,161
came a copy of the test results.

1034
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:51,098
Yes, I passed.
[chuckles]

1035
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:54,468
There's nobody happier than
my folks that I had passed--

1036
00:48:54,535 --> 00:48:55,969
<i>My gosh, my kid made it</i> --

1037
00:48:56,036 --> 00:49:01,942
because I really wasn't in very
good shape to take those exams.

1038
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,210
So, we were ready then

1039
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:07,047
for the after school,
end of the school year picnic,

1040
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,215
which is right here

1041
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:10,918
on this very grounds
where we're sitting.

1042
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:14,922
All of the families
who had kids in school all came.

1043
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:16,490
It was potluck.

1044
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:18,392
Everybody brought
something to eat.

1045
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,327
And so, we had
this great big meal

1046
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:23,397
and we had ice cream afterwards.

1047
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:27,968
And then, the teacher
gave a little speech.

1048
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:31,205
And she said, "I want to thank
all of you parents

1049
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:32,806
"for all of the help you did

1050
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:34,775
in helping your children
during the year."

1051
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:36,109
And then she said,

1052
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:39,012
"Jerry Apps has passed
the eighth-grade examination

1053
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,183
and he is now eligible
to go to high school."

1054
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,918
I've talked with

1055
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:48,055
a lot of former teachers
at country schools.

1056
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:52,025
And as difficult it was to be
a teacher at a place like this,

1057
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:53,393
every one of those teachers
said,

1058
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,432
"Those were some of
my very best years as teachers."

1059
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:02,569
They knew that they were
making a major contribution

1060
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:04,171
to this community.

1061
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:06,173
And you could tell,

1062
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,776
with a big smile on the face
at the end of the year

1063
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:13,146
that they had succeeded
in doing that.

1064
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:16,850
And after we finished
the big meal,

1065
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:20,053
all of the fathers and
this was a tradition

1066
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,556
that went back as far as
the school was in existence

1067
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:23,924
I suspect.

1068
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:27,961
The fathers all played
softball with the kids

1069
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,264
and it's just great fun.

1070
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:33,000
And one of the things,
as I reflect on that,

1071
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:37,137
it's one of the few times
I'd ever seen my dad play

1072
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,872
anything.

1073
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:42,476
Farmers didn't take time
to play in those days,

1074
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:45,412
except at this school picnic,

1075
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:47,614
which was wonderful.

1076
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:50,083
Then a couple weeks later,

1077
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,719
at the courthouse in Wautoma,

1078
00:50:52,786 --> 00:50:55,822
where criminals were charged,

1079
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,025
we all sat.
[chuckles]

1080
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:01,295
200, I guess, of us,
who were going to graduate?

1081
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:03,764
'Cause that's where the
graduation was to take place.

1082
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,701
And Arthur Dietz was
the Superintendent of Schools.

1083
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:10,704
And he gave a little speech
on how wonderful it was

1084
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:13,807
that we had all successfully
passed eighth grade.

1085
00:51:13,874 --> 00:51:16,577
Tell the truth,
it was a big deal

1086
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:19,746
because there were a lot
of people in my generation

1087
00:51:19,813 --> 00:51:22,182
and certainly in
my folks' generation

1088
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:24,384
who had never graduated
from eighth grade.

1089
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:27,154
So, this was a big deal
to graduate from eighth grade.

1090
00:51:27,221 --> 00:51:29,890
And we all then walked across

1091
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,327
and in front of
where the judge would sit

1092
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:36,830
and Arthur Dietz
gave us each a diploma,

1093
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:38,398
which had my name on it!

1094
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:39,967
Wasn't just
a blank sheet of paper.

1095
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:41,201
It had my name on it.

1096
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:43,570
I have it hanging
on my wall today.

1097
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:44,938
It's a huge thing.

1098
00:51:45,005 --> 00:51:47,774
Twice as large
as the certificate

1099
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:50,677
I got from graduating
from the University.

1100
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:52,412
Twice as large.

1101
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,682
Then, after the graduation,
went home.

1102
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:58,752
And my dad went
into the bedroom

1103
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:01,622
and he came out
with a little present,

1104
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,056
something all wrapped up

1105
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:05,058
and he said,
"I want you to have this."

1106
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,793
And I unwrapped it

1107
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,397
and it was
a Little Ben pocket watch,

1108
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,634
a one dollar pocket watch
from my dad,

1109
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,604
the first watch I had ever had,
gold colored.

1110
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:19,173
I wish I had it today.

1111
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,609
It was the most wonderful thing
that you could ever imagine.

1112
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,012
It symbolized the fact that

1113
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:27,681
my dad had not graduated
from eighth grade

1114
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:29,416
and now I had.

1115
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:33,120
And for him,
that was very important

1116
00:52:33,187 --> 00:52:36,023
because of his generation
most of them

1117
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:39,760
wanted their children
to do better than they had done.

1118
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,595
And this was
a symbol of that.

1119
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:44,097
It's one of those things where
you almost break down and cry

1120
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:47,868
because I really wasn't
expecting much of anything.

1121

[soft piano music]

1122
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:58,145
But as I look back
at the whole experience,

1123
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:00,180
it was a wonderful education.

1124
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:03,350
I have no complaints whatsoever.

1125
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:06,553
I learned how to read,
I learned how to write,

1126
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,389
I learned how to sing
over the air,

1127
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:12,392
I learned some in-depth
information about nature,

1128
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:14,194
I learned something about art,

1129
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:16,163
and maybe above all,

1130
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:20,467
I learned how to get along
with little kids and big kids,

1131
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:24,538
and Polish kids and
Norwegian kids and German kids,

1132
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:27,808
and some who
couldn't hardly speak English.

1133
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:32,045
We all got along with each other
fantastically.

1134
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:35,415
We had our little miffs,
but by and large,

1135
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:38,519
I found that one of
the most interesting experiences

1136
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:43,056
as I look back now
from my other further education,

1137
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:47,361
how much I was learning
that was not in the books.

1138
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:51,198
The idea of working together,
of helping each other,

1139
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:53,200
of sharing with each other,

1140
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:56,870
of paying attention to
the teacher and respecting her,

1141
00:53:56,937 --> 00:54:00,174
but realizing
that she can't do it all.

1142
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:02,743
I learned how--

1143
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,411
I think most of the kids,

1144
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:07,214
we learned
how to learn by ourselves

1145
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:09,716
and that's an invaluable lesson.

1146
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:13,253
And I have a picture
of the kids all lined up

1147
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,355
in front of this very school
on the steps.

1148
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,825
And three of the kids
have Ph.D. degrees.

1149
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:21,461
I don't know of any of them
that didn't do well

1150
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:24,932
in whatever profession or job
they sought.

1151
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:26,400
And above all,

1152
00:54:26,466 --> 00:54:29,269
we formed a community of kids,

1153
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:33,807
working together with
the teacher, with the parents,

1154
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:37,644
as a kind of a microcosm
of the larger community.

1155
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:41,481
There's no better place
to learn what community is

1156
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:44,718
than attending
a one-room country school

1157
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,254
for several years
as I did.

1158
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,763
I was at the meeting

1159
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,133
when they closed
our school in 1955.

1160
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,969
I was in college then.

1161
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:03,637
And there was
a researcher who came out

1162
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:05,372
and he said,
"With a consolidated school,

1163
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:06,840
"your kids will be able to

1164
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:09,943
"learn and participate

just not available out here."

1166
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:13,180
And there was an old guy
in the back

1167
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:15,048
and he held up his hand
and he said,

1168
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:16,650
