1
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:07,375
- Angela Fitzgerald: Tee off at
Norsk Golf Club in Mount Horeb

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:10,625
and there's a good chance
of crossing cart paths

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,125
with Nolan Krentz.

4
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,000
- Nolan Krentz:
When I was six or seven,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,250
Mom got us
into junior lessons out here,

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,542
and basically been
playing out here ever since,

7
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,999
25 years or so.

8
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,291
- He's the Mount Horeb
High School golf coach,

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,250
but he also spends
most of his<i>free time</i>

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,999
in the fairway.

11
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,834
[whoosh, clank]

12
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,583
Get up there.

13
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,125
I play all seasons.

14
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,125
I mean, I'll play
basically February to December.

15
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,375
- Angela: It's safe to say

16
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,999
Nolan plays
a lot of golf.

17
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,999
<i>A lot</i>of golf...

18
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:48,375
[powerful swings]

19
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,166
- Nolan: 250, 275 days
of the year probably,

20
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,291
I'm stepping foot
on a golf course, yep.

21
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,999
- A few years ago,
he set a goal,

22
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,125
[magical sparkle]
play 10,000 holes in a year.

23
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,000
His<i>drive
</i> only increased from there.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,333
[whoosh, metallic plink]

25
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,041
- You know, if you got
10,000 holes one year,

26
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,375
your goal is to get 10,001
the next year.

27
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,000
[club pings ball,
ball rattles in hole]

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,999
- 10,000 [magical sparkle]
led to 12,000.

29
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:15,999
Then, during the pandemic,

30
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:19,667
he already had the perfect hobby
to pass the time.

31
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:23,000
He played
more than 17,000 holes

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,166
in both 2020
and 2021.

33
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,000
- And then,
it got to be

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,500
where I really wanted to get
to 18,000 that year in 2022.

35
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:34,750
[gentle clack]

36
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,959
- Angela: 18,000 holes.

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,709
That's almost
50 holes a day.

38
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:40,625
But this is Wisconsin,

39
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,709
and to make up for all the time
lost to the weather,

40
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,041
Nolan often played
72 holes a day.

41
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,709
- Definitely not going full out
on every swing.

42
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,999
You're kind of, you know,
saving yourself, saving energy.

43
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,999
I'm not maxed going out
all the time,

44
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:58,166
so that helps me hit the ball
a little straighter.

45
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,999
[high-pitched metallic bing]

46
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,834
- It also helps

47
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,999
that he's a good player
and he plays fast.

48
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,583
[hits ball hard]

49
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,000
- All right.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,083
- It takes him about 45 minutes
to play the nine-hole course.

51
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,417
He never has to
think long about his next shot.

52
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,125
- Nolan: More than likely or
not, I've been there before.

53
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,000
Maybe even that day
I've been in that spot.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,125
That's why I'm able
to pick a club so quickly,

55
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,709
and basically,
just hit a shot from there.

56
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:24,792
[quick hit]

57
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,291
- Angela: Why does he do this?

58
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,041
It provides peace,
quiet, and focus.

59
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,000
- Yeah, I think for me
it's, you know,

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,999
some sort
of self-fulfillment.

61
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,750
You know, you have a couple
hours where you are just,

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,834
you're in your own,
you know,

63
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,083
you're focused
just on what you're doing.

64
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,999
Oh, we did get her.

- The Wisconsin State Golf
Association

66
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,792
presents Nolan Krentz
with this...

67
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:50,999
- That's why, in 2022, he set
an unofficial world record

68
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:54,417
for number of golf holes
played in a single year.

69
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:55,999
- Nolan: 18,018.

70
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:59,625
So, it's a good number
to finish on and remember.

71
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,125
18,018.

72
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:02,542
[thwack]

73
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,999
- Nolan's still busy
chasing birdies,

74
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:06,709
but these days,

75
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,999
coaching and teaching
take more of his time.

76
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,083
So, for now, a bigger number
will have to wait.

77
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,333
Until then,

78
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,875
the sight of Nolan
walking around Norsk

79
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,875
will always be
<i>par</i>for the course.

80
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,625
- Nolan: I think it's
definitely, safe to say,

81
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,999
it's definitely a passion,
definitely a driving force,

82
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,999
an integral part
of my life

83
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:26,959
on a day-to-day basis.

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,500
So, yeah, kind of a theme every
year, basically,

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,125
is play
until snow is on the ground.
