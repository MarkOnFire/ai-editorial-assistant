1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,036
- We're exploring Taliesin,

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,539
home and studio
of Frank Lloyd Wright,

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:06,807
touring the estate

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:12,012
and learning about their
extensive restoration work.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,083
My first stop was
to the Hillside Theater

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,151
to meet up
with Executive Director

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,987
Carrie Rodamaker,

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,323
and to learn more about the
history and preservation

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,726
of this 800-acre estate.

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,496
- Carrie Rodamaker: Taliesin is
Frank Lloyd Wright's home.

11
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,664
This is a place

12
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,100
where his ancestors
immigrated from Wales.

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,536
He grew to love this area,

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,473
and eventually built
his own home in 1911.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,775
One of the things that Wright
was doing was playing

16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,144
with the surrounding beauty
of the land

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,581
and incorporating
his buildings into it.

18
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,383
- Beautiful, and so
what does that look like

19
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,118
in terms of how
they're constructed?

20
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,254
- So, part of it is
organic architecture.

21
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,490
So using natural material.

22
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,826
A lot of the limestone
was harvested from here.

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,195
You'll see a lot of oak.

24
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,163
But you'll also see a lot
of new materials,

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,865
like plywood.

26
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,768
Because of all of those
kind of natural materials,

27
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,236
and this being
that laboratory,

28
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,805
that experimental place
for Wright,

29
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,374
it poses huge challenges.

30
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,643
It's almost like an
archaeological dig,

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,712
so we can understand
what they were doing

32
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,514
before we can start
to figure out

33
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,449
how do we
kind of reconstruct

34
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,152
and preserve
the historic fabric,

35
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,556
but also making it
sustainable for the future.

36
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,328
- Angela: An example
of that historic fabric

37
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,530
is this curtain
Wright designed

38
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,966
that hangs
in Taliesin's theater,

39
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,301
where we chatted
with Caroline Hamblen,

40
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,403
Director of Programs.

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,805
- Caroline Hamblen: So the
Hillside Theater

42
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,039
just reopened last year.

43
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,008
It was designed by Wright
to bring lectures,

44
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,845
dance, theater, movies
into the space.

45
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,115
And that legacy is something
that we're continuing to today.

46
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,416
- Are there other types
of programs

47
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,584
or other opportunities

48
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,253
that are available here?
- Absolutely.

49
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,388
So, we have our
regular tour program.

50
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,457
There is four different
variety of tours

51
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,058
that you can come
and engage with us

52
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,527
May through October.

53
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,228
We work a lot with schools.

54
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,964
We love working with
educators from the region,

55
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,366
bringing their students
here.

56
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,868
Then there is
workshop opportunities,

57
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,170
and then we have
the programming

58
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,740
of the Hillside Theater
available as well.

59
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,843
- So lots of opportunities
throughout the estate

60
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,778
for all ages
throughout the year.

61
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,946
- Yes, absolutely.

62
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,481
And that is really
the goal,

63
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,616
that is what Taliesin
always has been,

64
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,352
and that's what we want
to continue into the future.

65
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,654
All kinds
of different ages,

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,923
different interests,
bringing everybody here

67
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,459
into this UNESCO
World Heritage site now.

68
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,261
- Angela: A site that
will be preserved

69
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,664
for future generations.

70
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,867
From the stage...
- Caroline: Now you can see

71
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,703
how the size of the stage
almost doubled.

72
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,705
You notice that part
of the stage

73
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,807
is built into the ground.

74
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,008
And that caused a lot

75
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,145
of water infiltration
issues.

76
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,047
- Angela:
...to the green rooms.

77
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,648
So this is part
of the new space?

78
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,150
- Caroline: We've never had
green rooms

79
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,052
for the artists.

80
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:09,456
The room behind the stage
used to be dirt floor.

81
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,326
- Angela: All to honor the
world-famous architect

82
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,562
who Carrie Rodamaker says
loved Wisconsin

83
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,531
and called it home.

84
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,334
- Carrie: I think we just
want to celebrate Wisconsin,

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,936
we wanna celebrate
this place.

86
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,638
Celebrate Wright
for growing up

87
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,573
as a Wisconsin farm kid.

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,308
This is where
he was really creating

89
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,877
an architecture
for America,

90
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,780
and we encourage people
to come and see it.

91
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,516
