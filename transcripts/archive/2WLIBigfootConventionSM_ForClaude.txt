[eerie music]

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,106
- Kim Lonetree:
There is a trail

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,741
right next to a bunch of woods.

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,510
I was with a couple other people

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:14,047
and I heard footsteps
in the woods following us.

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,716
- Rich Daniels: There's
something big

7
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,084
moving in the woods.

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,286
- Avery Barsch: I would describe
it around eight feet,

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,454
really hairy.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,456
- Rich: This thing was massive.
[knocking]

11
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,191
- Barnaby Jones: Something
very large

12
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,392
came through the woods
towards us.

13
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,027
[snapping]
- Rich: And it caught my eye

14
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,962
and I stared right at it.

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,131
[animalistic howling]

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,737
- Kim: This was
a Bigfoot encounter.

20
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,285
- My name is Barnaby Jones.

21
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,920
I am a cryptozoologist
and the founder

22
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,723
of Cryptids, Anomalies,
and the Paranormal Society.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,359
100%, I believe in Bigfoot.

24
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:07,868
In 2017, they launched the first
convention here in Marinette,

25
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,504
and they had a huge success.

26
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,343
And then, this is the third year
that we've been back up running,

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,147
so six conventions so far,
including this one.

28
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,749
Today, we are here
to talk about Bigfoot,

29
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,752
and Bigfoot
on a very local level.

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,055
- In particular
in the Bigfoot field,

31
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,391
they believe they have some
sort of close contact,

32
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,561
some sort of intimate connection
to the creature.

33
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,796
- They had all these people,

34
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,098
and they wanted
to bring in speakers

35
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,100
that were knowledgeable
about the topic.

36
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,902
- He believed he had
encountered something

37
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,004
not of this universe.

38
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,939
- Barnaby: To come in and
present their findings

39
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,875
to people local in the area.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,543
[recording of roar]

41
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,146
- It's all about Bigfoot,
and it's all these individuals

42
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,350
that are very interested
in Bigfoot and cryptids

43
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,951
coming out to this conference.

44
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,021
- This is a phenomenon
that's not just on TV.

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,223
It's not just
in the Pacific Northwest.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,225
It's all over this country.

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,461
- A lot of people come the
conventions like this

48
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,463
because they have nowhere else
to go.

49
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,965
They have these experiences,
they have these stories,

50
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,501
and if you tell somebody that
you see a Bigfoot,

51
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,503
you've had a ghost encounter,
a UFO encounter,

52
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,573
people look at you and they're
gonna think that you're crazy.

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,974
So events like this,

54
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:25,779
it gives people an outlet to
come and be with their people.

55

[aerosol spraying]

57
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,162
- Through almost every inch
of this property,

58
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:46,433
so I have a pretty good idea
of what most things are.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,968
We're going out
on this property,

60
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,503
we are taking groups of people

61
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,773
because everyone wants to go out
with us and see this.

62
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,541
So we're gonna go out
on the property,

63
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,910
we're gonna see what happens.

64
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,812
We're looking out over here,

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,682
and this creature is standing
there looking at us,

66
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,750
and the lights are--
the eyes are illuminated

67
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,752
to the fact that I can take
my flashlight away

68
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,087
and they still shine.

69
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,956
[coyotes yelping]

70
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,062
That's coyotes.

71
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,964
- Rich: It's the perfect
laboratory

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,398
for studying this field,

73
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,201
because there's activity almost
every time you walk out there

74
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,636
if you're paying attention.

75
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,005
- Barnaby: We have gathered
every kind of evidence

76
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,540
that is possible.

77
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,775
We've gotten thermal,
we've gotten trail cameras,

78
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,378
we've gotten audio, footprints.

79
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,180
We've gotten it all
off this property.

80
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,481
- Kim: I personally believe

81
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,252
that what they've experienced
on that property is real.

82
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,053
[animalistic yelping]

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,357
- Is that you
or something natural?

84
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,861
- Rich: I thought that was you.

85
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,097
- It was an amazing experience.

86
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,099
- We got to hear a howl,

87
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,435
followed by a lot of coyotes
howling at the same time.

88
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,437
- Barnaby: And that's what draws
people to these things

89
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,507
like the paranormal, ghosts,
Bigfoot, all of that.

90
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,478
Because people want to believe
in something more.

91
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,147
That there's not just
an end to this.

92
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,016
That there's more out there
to be discovered.

93
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,751
It's the sense of adventure.

94
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,553
- If you go out looking
for these things

95
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,154
and you expect to find them
every time,

96
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,622
you're gonna be
very disappointed.

97
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,491
- If you go out there
to share stories,

98
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,659
spend time with people,

99
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,195
you're always gonna
have a good time.

100
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,629
- Rich: One thing's for sure.

101
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,765
Once you have an experience
with this,

102
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,800
it never leaves you.

103
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,535
