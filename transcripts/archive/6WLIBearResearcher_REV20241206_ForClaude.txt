00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,106
I specifically

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,176
work with bear, elk, and wolves.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,914
We're looking at cub survival,

4
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,317
litter
size, and litter frequency.

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,454
These animals are incredible.

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:24,424
We can't do this project
without you guys.

7
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,004
I feel like every day
is pretty great

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,206
for a bear researcher.

00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:41,775
Thanks Mama.

00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,845
